developments in with special customer electric service agreements idaho power is authorized to enter into special electric service arrangements with customers that have an aggregate power requirement that exceeds megawatts mw 
notable recent developments with respect to one of those arrangements are described below 
in march  the ipuc approved a september electric service agreement between idaho power and hoku materials  inc hoku  to provide electric service to hoku s polysilicon production facility being constructed in pocatello  idaho 
the initial term of the agreement is four years beginning december   with a maximum demand obligation during the initial term of mw 
hoku was still not taking significant service as of december  in december  idaho power sent to hoku a notice of termination of service pursuant to ipuc rules to terminate service as a result of an overdue invoice for electric service 
on january   hoku filed a petition with the ipuc alleging that its contract with idaho power was contrary to the public interest and requested that the ipuc reform the contract and sought reparations for previously paid amounts under the electric service agreement 
on january   the ipuc ordered idaho power and hoku to enter into negotiations to seek settlement of hoku s petition 
on february   idaho power  hoku  and the ipuc staff filed with the ipuc a settlement stipulation that would amend the electric service agreement 
the stipulation provides for a minimum monthly charge of million compared to the existing minimum monthly charge of approximately million from january to july and the establishment of a balancing mechanism that will track and accrue up to a maximum balance of approximately million on a monthly basis the difference between a the first block minimum energy charges excluding demand charges under the existing agreement and b the modified minimum billed energy charge excluding demand charges under the settlement stipulation 
in january  idaho power will begin invoicing hoku for  in addition to applicable demand and energy charges  recovery of the deferred amount over a month period  one twelfth per month 
further  the stipulation provides that hoku will pay to idaho power million upon ipuc approval of the stipulation out of existing funds on deposit with idaho power  and million per month in cash for months commencing with its january invoice 
the stipulation also extends the term of the electric service agreement through december  during the final year of the agreement  hoku will pay embedded cost based rates for service 
hoku agrees in the stipulation to cap its monthly power demand during the january to july deferral period to mw  with the option to increase usage to mw following a notice period and payment of applicable deposits 
in the event hoku uses more than mw of energy in any given month  hoku will be required to pay the minimum billed energy charge amounts set forth in the existing electric service agreement 
wholesale as a public utility under part ii of the federal power act fpa  idaho power has authority to charge market based rates for wholesale energy sales under its ferc tariff and to provide transmission services under its open access transmission tariff oatt 
idaho power s oatt is revised each year based on financial and operational data idaho power files annually with the ferc in its form the energy policy act of granted the ferc increased statutory authority to implement mandatory transmission and network reliability standards  as well as enhanced oversight of power and transmission markets  including protection against market manipulation 
these mandatory transmission and reliability standards  which are applicable to idaho power  were developed by the north american electric reliability corporation nerc and the western electricity coordinating council wecc  which has responsibility for compliance and enforcement of transmission and reliability standards 
idaho power has one low volume wholesale reserve sales contract  with united materials of great falls  inc the agreement requires idaho power to carry energy reserves in association with an energy sales agreement between idaho power and united materials from the horseshoe bend wind farm located in montana 
the term of the agreement runs seasonally through may idaho power had one firm wholesale power sales contract with raft river electric cooperative for up to mw  which expired in september idaho power participates in the wholesale energy market by buying power to help meet load demands and selling power that is in excess of load demands 
idaho power s market activities are guided by a risk management policy and frequently updated operating plans  which are influenced by customer load  market prices  generating costs  and availability of generating resources 
some of idaho power s hydroelectric generation facilities are operated to optimize the water that is available by choosing when to run hydroelectric generation units and when to store water in reservoirs 
these decisions affect the timing and volumes of market purchases and market sales 
even in below normal water years  there are opportunities to vary water usage to maximize generation unit efficiency  capture marketplace economic benefits  and meet load demand 
wholesale energy market prices and compliance factors  such as allowable river stage elevation changes and flood control requirements  influence these dispatch decisions 
energy sales the table below presents idaho power s revenues and energy use by customer type for the last three years 
approximately percent of idaho power s general business revenue comes from customers located in idaho  with the remainder coming from customers located in oregon 
idaho power s operations are discussed further in part ii  item md a results of operations utility operations 
year ended december  revenues thousands of dollars residential commercial industrial irrigation provision for sharing deferred revenue related to hells canyon complex relicensing afudc total general business off system sales other total energy use thousands of mwh residential commercial industrial irrigation total general business off system sales total power supply idaho power primarily relies on company owned hydroelectric  coal  and gas fired generation facilities and long term power purchase agreements to supply the energy needed to serve customers 
idaho power s annual hydroelectric generation varies depending on water conditions in the snake river 
market purchases and sales are used to balance supply and demand throughout the year 
idaho power s generating plants and their capacities are listed in part i  item properties 
weather  load demand  and economic conditions impact power supply costs 
drought conditions and increased peak load demand cause a greater reliance on potentially more expensive energy sources to meet load requirements 
conversely  favorable hydroelectric generation conditions increase production at idaho power s hydroelectric generating facilities and reduce the need for thermal generation and purchased power 
economic conditions can affect the market price of natural gas and coal  which may impact fuel expense and market prices for purchased power 
idaho power s system is dual peaking  with the larger peak demand occurring in the summer 
the all time system peak demand is  mw  set on june   and the all time winter peak demand is  mw  set on december  during these and other similarly heavy load periods idaho power s system is fully committed to serve load and meet required operating reserves 
during  the largest peak demand was  mw  set on july  the following table presents idaho power s total power supply for the last three years mwh percent of total generation thousands of mwh hydroelectric plants coal fired plants natural gas fired plants total system generation purchased power cogeneration and small power production purchased power other total purchased power total power supply hydroelectric generation idaho power operates hydroelectric projects located on the snake river and its tributaries 
together  these hydroelectric facilities provide a total nameplate capacity of  mw and annual generation equal to approximately million megawatt hours mwh under median water conditions 
the availability of hydroelectric power depends on the amount of snow pack in the mountains upstream of idaho power s hydroelectric facilities  reservoir storage  springtime snow pack run off  river base flows  spring flows  rainfall  amount and timing of water leases  and other weather and stream flow management considerations 
during low water years  when stream flows into idaho power s hydroelectric projects are reduced  idaho power s hydroelectric generation is reduced 
the manner in which idaho power has optimized operation of its hydroelectric facilities in the past has been impacted by intermittent wind generation and may continue to be impacted in the future as the company is faced with integrating an increasing amount of intermittent wind generation 
as additional intermittent wind generation resources are developed in the region and contracted to idaho power  the operational impacts will likely increase 
for related information on intermittent wind generation see purchased power agreements below 
significantly greater snow accumulation during the winter and the resulting effect on stream flow conditions resulted in above average stream flow in  which resulted in a million mwh increase in generation from idaho power s hydroelectric facilities compared to the observed stream flow data released in august by the us army corps of engineers  northwest division indicated that brownlee reservoir inflow for april through july was million acre feet maf  compared to maf in april through july and maf in april through july annual brownlee reservoir inflow for was maf compared to maf in and maf in power generation at the idaho power hydroelectric power plants on the snake river also depends on the state water rights held by idaho power and the long term sustainability of the snake river  tributary spring flows  and the eastern snake plain aquifer that is connected to the snake river 
idaho power continues to participate in water management issues in idaho that may affect those water rights and resources with the goal to preserve  to the fullest extent possible  the long term availability of water for use at idaho power s hydroelectric projects on the snake river 
for more information on water management issues see note contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
idaho power is subject to the provisions of the fpa as a public utility and as a licensee 
as a licensee under part i of the fpa  idaho power and its licensed hydroelectric projects are subject to conditions described in the fpa and related ferc regulations 
these conditions and regulations include provisions relating to condemnation of a project upon payment of just compensation  amortization of project investment from excess project earnings  possible takeover of a project after expiration of its license upon payment of net investment  severance damages  and other matters 
idaho power obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the ferc  similar to other utilities that operate nonfederal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways 
the licensing process includes an extensive public review process and involves numerous natural resource and environmental issues 
the licenses last from to years depending on the size  complexity  and cost of the project 
idaho power is actively pursuing the relicensing of the hells canyon complex and swan falls projects 
idaho power also has three oregon licenses under the oregon hydroelectric act  which applies to idaho power s brownlee  oxbow  and hells canyon facilities 
for further information on relicensing activities see part ii  item md a regulatory matters relicensing of hydroelectric projects 
coal and natural gas fired generation idaho power co owns three coal fired power plants and owns two natural gas fired combustion turbine power plants 
the coal fired plants are jim bridger located in wyoming  in which idaho power has a one third interest  boardman located in oregon  in which idaho power has a percent interest  and valmy located in nevada  in which idaho power has a percent interest 
the natural gas fired plants  danskin and bennett mountain  are located in idaho 
the langley gulch natural gas fired combined cycle power plant located in idaho is currently under construction and is contracted to achieve commercial operation no later than november  based on the current project status  idaho power estimates that the plant will be in service by july  fuel supply coal idaho power  through its subsidiary ierco  owns a one third interest in bcc  which owns the jim bridger mine that supplies coal to the jim bridger generating plant  which is operated by pacificorp 
the mine  located near the jim bridger plant  operates under a long term sales agreement that provides for delivery of coal over a year period ending in from surface  high wall  and underground sources 
idaho power believes that the jim bridger mine has sufficient reserves to provide coal deliveries for the term of the sales agreement 
idaho power also has a coal supply contract providing for annual deliveries of coal through from the black butte coal company s black butte mine located near the jim bridger plant 
this contract supplements the bridger coal deliveries and provides another coal supply to operate the jim bridger plant 
the jim bridger plant s rail load in facility and unit coal train provide the opportunity to access other fuel supplies for tonnage requirements above established contract minimums 
the boardman generating plant receives coal through annual contracts with suppliers from the powder river basin in northeast wyoming 
portland general electric company  as the operator of the boardman plant  has two agreements to supply coal beginning in all of the boardman plant s coal requirements in  approximately percent in  and percent in  are under contract 
a portion of the and coal used will be low sulfur content as boardman prepares for the transition to a lower sulfur fuel content 
as a ten percent owner of the plant  idaho power is obligated to purchase ten percent of the coal purchased under these agreements 
in december  the oregon environmental quality commission approved a plan to cease coal fired operations at the boardman power plant not later than december  for additional information  see part ii  item md a environmental matters environmental regulation 
nv energy  inc  as the operator of the valmy generating plant  has agreements with coal suppliers through idaho power s share of these agreements along with existing coal inventory at the plant cover idaho power s projected coal supply needs for   and and approximately percent in as a percent owner of the plant  idaho power is obligated for one half of the coal purchased under these contracts 
fuel supply natural gas idaho power owns and operates the danskin and bennett mountain combustion turbines  and is constructing its langley gulch natural gas fired combined cycle power plant 
natural gas for all facilities is purchased based on system requirements and dispatch efficiency 
the natural gas is supplied through williams northwest pipeline under idaho power s  million british thermal units mmbtu per day long term gas transportation service agreements 
the agreements vary in contract length  with the latest termination date of may  but with extensions at idaho power s discretion 
in addition to the long term gas transportation service agreements  idaho power has entered into a long term storage service agreement with northwest pipeline for  mmbtu of total storage capacity at the jackson prairie storage project 
as the project is developed  storage capacity will be phased into service and allocated to idaho power on a monthly basis 
idaho power s current storage allotment is approximately percent of its eventual total  with its full allotment expected to be reached by july this firm storage contract expires in natural gas will be purchased and stored with the intent of fulfilling needs as identified for seasonal peaks or to meet system requirements 
idaho power estimates that its langley gulch plant will be in service by july   in time to contribute to meeting summer loads 
approximately million mmbtu s of natural gas has been hedged using financial instruments for future purchases for start up testing of the plant expected to take place between march and may along with this  approximately million mmbtu s of natural gas has been financially hedged for future purchases for the operational dispatch of langley gulch from july to january idaho power plans to manage the procurement of additional natural gas as necessary to meet system requirements and fueling strategies 
purchased power agreements idaho power purchases power in the wholesale market and pursuant to long term power purchase contracts  as described below wholesale market purchases idaho power purchases power in the wholesale market based on economics  operating reserve margins  risk limits  and unit availability  and from purpa projects as mandated 
idaho power seeks to manage its loads efficiently by utilizing its generation resources and long term purchase power contracts in conjunction with buying and selling opportunities in the wholesale market 
idaho power has the following notable firm wholesale power purchase contracts and energy exchange agreements ppl energy plus  llc for mw per hour during heavy load hours  to address increased demand during june  july and august 
the contract term is through august  raft river energy i  llc for up to mw nameplate generation from its raft river geothermal power plant unit located in southern idaho 
the contract term is through april  telocaset wind power partners  llc for mw nameplate generation from its elkhorn valley wind project located in eastern oregon 
the contract term is through  usg oregon llc for mw estimated average annual output from the to be constructed neal hot springs geothermal power plant located near vale  oregon 
the contract term is years with an option to extend 
usg oregon llc has stated that it expects commercial operation by late  and clatskanie people s utility for the exchange of up to mw of energy from the arrowrock project in southern idaho for energy from idaho power s system or power purchased at the mid columbia trading hub 
the initial term of the agreement is january  through december  idaho power has the right to renew the agreement for two additional five year terms 
cspp and purpa power purchase contracts pursuant to the requirements of section of purpa  the state regulatory commissions having jurisdiction over idaho power have each issued orders and rules regulating idaho power s purchase of power from cogeneration and small power production cspp facilities 
a key component of the purpa contracts is the energy price contained within the agreements 
purpa regulations specify that a utility must pay energy prices based on the utility s avoided costs 
the published avoided cost is a price established by the ipuc and opuc to estimate idaho power s cost of developing additional generation resources 
the ipuc and opuc have established specific rules and regulations to calculate the published avoided cost that idaho power is required to include in purpa contracts 
idaho power has contracts for the purchase of energy from a number of private developers 
for these contracts idaho power is required to purchase all of the output from the facilities located inside its service territory  subject to some exceptions such as adverse impacts on system reliability  idaho power is required to purchase the output of projects located outside its service territory if it has the ability to receive power at the facility s requested point of delivery on the idaho power system  the ipuc jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with cspp contracts is fully recovered through base rates and the pca  and the opuc jurisdictional portion is recovered through general rate case filings and the pcam  ipuc jurisdictional regulations allow ipuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term 
effective december   wind and solar resource projects with a nameplate rating of kw or less are eligible for the ipuc published avoided costs 
for all other resource types  a project that generates up to ten average mw of energy monthly is eligible for the ipuc published avoided costs  opuc jurisdictional regulations allow opuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term for projects with a nameplate rating of up to ten mw of capacity  and if a purpa project does not qualify for published avoided costs  idaho power is required to negotiate the terms  prices  and conditions with the developer 
these negotiations reflect the characteristics of the individual projects ie  operational flexibility  location  and size and the benefits to the idaho power system and must be consistent with other similar energy alternatives 
idaho power believes that published avoided cost rates in effect as of the date of this report provide a favorable climate for purpa project development 
mandated purchase of intermittent  non dispatchable energy at published avoided cost rates may result in idaho power acquiring energy at above wholesale market prices when a surplus already exists at times resulting in sale of the surplus energy in the wholesale markets at a loss and result in additional integration costs  thus increasing costs to its customers 
following a dramatic increase in anticipated purpa projects  in response to a november  application filed by idaho power and two other electric utilities with idaho service territories  on february   the ipuc issued an order temporarily reducing the eligibility cap for projects obtaining published avoided cost rates  effective retroactively to december   to kw for wind and solar purpa projects only 
on june   the ipuc disapproved contracts for pending wind projects with a combined nameplate capacity of mw 
if these contracts had all been approved  the amount of wind generation that idaho power had under contract would have exceeded  mw 
the ipuc has opened a docket to further investigate purpa contract terms and conditions and pricing models 
this matter is scheduled for hearings in august for further information on those proceedings  refer to md a regulatory matters purpa power purchase contracts 
as of december   idaho power had mw of solar power generation under contract for purchase 
in december  idaho power entered into a purpa purchase power agreement for a mw waste biomass generation project 
idaho power has also entered into a number of other purpa agreements for smaller renewable energy projects 
as of december   idaho power had the following signed cspp related agreements with terms ranging from one to years status number of contracts nameplate capacity mw on line at the end of contracted and projected to come on line by year end total the majority of new facilities will be wind resources that will generate on an intermittent basis 
during  idaho power purchased million mwh of power from cspp facilities at a cost of million  resulting in a blended price of per mwh 
transmission services electric transmission systems deliver energy from electric generation facilities to distribution systems for final delivery to customers 
transmission systems are designed to move electricity over long distances because generation facilities can be located anywhere from a few miles to hundreds of miles from customers 
idaho power s generating facilities are interconnected through its integrated transmission system and are operated on a coordinated basis to achieve maximum load carrying capability and reliability 
idaho power s transmission system is directly interconnected with the transmission systems of the bonneville power administration bpa  avista corporation  pacificorp  northwestern energy  and nv energy  inc these interconnections  coupled with transmission line capacity made available under agreements with some of the above entities  permit the interchange  purchase  and sale of power among entities in the western power system 
idaho power provides wholesale transmission service and provides firm and non firm wheeling services for eligible transmission customers 
idaho power is a member of the wecc  the western systems power pool  the northwest power pool  the northern tier transmission group  and the north american energy standards board 
these groups have been formed to more efficiently coordinate transmission reliability and planning throughout the western grid 
resource planning and renewable energy projects integrated resource plan idaho power filed its integrated resource plan irp with the ipuc and opuc in june the irp forecasts idaho power s load and resource situation for the next years  analyzes potential supply side and demand side options  and identifies near term and long term actions 
the irp was accepted by the ipuc in december as of the date of this report the irp has not been acknowledged by the opuc 
the four primary goals of the irp are to identify sufficient resources to reliably serve the growing demand for energy within idaho power s service area throughout the year planning period  ensure the selected resource portfolio balances cost  risk  and environmental concerns  give equal and balanced treatment to both supply side resources and demand side measures  and involve the public in the planning process in a meaningful way 
idaho power updates the irp every two years and work on the irp will begin in the summer of idaho power expects that the updated plan will be completed and filed in june during the time between resource plan filings  the public and regulatory oversight of the activities identified in the irp allows for discussion and adjustment of the irp as warranted 
idaho power makes periodic adjustments and corrections to the resource plan to reflect changes in technology  economic conditions  anticipated resource development  and regulatory requirements 
the irp included the mw langley gulch project currently under construction and a mw expansion of the shoshone falls hydroelectric facility 
the irp also identified the boardman to hemingway transmission line in the preferred resource portfolio 
idaho power believes the boardman to hemingway transmission line and the hemingway substation  together with the gateway west transmission line  will improve reliability  relieve congestion  and provide system flexibility 
additional information about idaho power s significant infrastructure development projects are discussed in part ii  item md a liquidity and capital resources capital requirements major infrastructure projects 
the expected case load forecast in the irp projects peak hour load will grow mw annually and average system load will increase annually average mw amw over the year planning period  with an expected case  median  average annual system load of  amw by idaho power intends to meet the anticipated increase in demand through energy efficiency and demand response programs  the development of transmission capacity and additional generation resources  such as the langley gulch and shoshone falls projects  and from the purchase of power from third parties  including from renewable energy projects and market power purchases 
idaho power stated in the irp that it expects energy efficiency programs to result in amw of load reduction by  and that demand response programs are targeted to reduce peak summer load by mw by summer the irp also included discussion related to geothermal  combined heat and power chp  and solar resources  each of which is described below 
geothermal resources idaho power has continued to work with geothermal project developers capable of delivering energy to the company s service area 
the irp included two mw increments of geothermal energy in the preferred portfolio one in and one in the mw increment in was addressed by a long term power purchase agreement for the output from the neal hot springs geothermal project located in eastern oregon 
this project is currently under construction and the developer expects it to be operational in late idaho power has contracted to receive the recs from the project during the term of the agreement 
the additional increment of geothermal energy was evaluated in the irp and was found unnecessary with the addition of the boardman to hemingway transmission line project 
the preferred portfolio in the irp did include mw of geothermal energy in and idaho power plans to follow the development of geothermal resources in and around idaho power s service area in the event a project materializes that could fill this need in chp resources chp  also commonly referred to as cogeneration  facilities utilize by product heat often through steam to generate electricity 
chp resources were not included in the irp preferred portfolio because of the uncertainty in being able to successfully develop a chp project 
however  idaho power continues to work with large customers and other parties to explore chp development opportunities 
in  idaho power signed an agreement to jointly investigate a chp project with the idaho office of energy resources ioer and the amalgamated sugar company tasco  one of idaho power s large industrial customers 
the agreement established the framework for a high level feasibility study to investigate installing a chp project at tasco s nampa  idaho facility that could generate as much as mw of electricity 
the ioer and idaho power jointly funded the study  which confirmed initial estimates of the project s potential benefits 
in september  idaho power  ioer  and tasco agreed to complete a more detailed feasibility study to refine performance and financial modeling of the proposed project 
the second feasibility study indicated that the chp project is technically feasible  however  given the increase in the amount of purpa power generation idaho power now has under contract  current economic and electric power market conditions  the current treatment of chp projects under federal incentive programs  and tasco s and ipc s individual needs  proceeding with developing this chp project does not appear to be the most economic choice for either party 
solar resources on or before january   idaho power is required to own or contract to purchase the capacity and output from a qualifying solar photovoltaic pv system with a minimum capacity of kw pursuant to the state of oregon s solar pv capacity standard 
the timing of development of this required project in oregon and the solar demonstration project referenced in idaho power s irp will depend in large part on idaho power s ability to resolve integration  reliability  and cost issues associated with the recent influx of purpa resources from which idaho power is currently mandated to purchase power 
however  with the cost of solar pv technology continuing to decrease  idaho power believes this technology will become more prevalent in its service area 
idaho power continues to evaluate the timing for proceeding with solar resource projects 
energy efficiency and demand response programs idaho power has energy efficiency and demand response programs targeting energy savings across the entire year and summer system demand reduction 
these programs are offered to all customer segments and emphasize the wise use of energy  especially during periods of high demand 
this energy and demand reduction can minimize or delay the need for new infrastructure 
idaho power s programs include financial incentives for irrigation customers for either improving the energy efficiency of an irrigation system or installing new energy efficient systems  energy efficiency for new and existing homes  including efficient appliances and hvac equipment  energy efficient building techniques  insulation improvement  air duct sealing  and energy efficient lighting  incentives to industrial and commercial customers for acquiring energy efficient equipment  and using energy efficiency techniques for operational and management processes  and demand response programs to reduce peak summer demand through the voluntary interruption of central air conditioners for residential customers  interruption of irrigation pumps  and reduction of commercial and industrial demand through a third party demand response aggregator 
in  idaho power s energy efficiency programs reduced energy usage by approximately  mwh 
idaho power s demand response programs had available capacity of approximately mw  however  because of a relatively mild summer and the restructuring of idaho power s irrigation peak rewards program  idaho power realized approximately mw in summer peak demand reduction through combined performance 
in  idaho power spent approximately million on energy efficiency and targeted demand reduction response programs 
approximately million of funding for these programs is provided by idaho and oregon energy efficiency tariff riders  while the balance of the funding comes from idaho power base rates 
beginning in  as approved by the ipuc  idaho power capitalized approximately million of custom efficiency program incentives as a regulatory asset 
approximately million of idaho power s energy efficiency spending was related to research and analysis  education  technology evaluation  and market transformation 
most of this activity was done in conjunction with the northwest energy efficiency alliance 
environmental regulation and costs idaho power s activities are subject to a broad range of federal  state  regional  and local laws and regulations designed to protect  restore  and enhance the quality of the environment 
environmental regulation continues to impact idaho power s operations due to the cost of installation and operation of equipment and facilities required for compliance with environmental regulations  and the modification of system operations to accommodate environmental regulations 
in addition to generally applicable regulations  the ferc licenses issued for idaho power s hydroelectric generating plants have environmental requirements such as aeration of turbine water to meet dissolved gas and temperature standards in the tail waters downstream from the plants 
idaho power monitors these issues and reports the results to the appropriate regulatory agencies 
idaho power co owns three coal fired power plants and owns two natural gas combustion turbine power plants that are subject to a broad range of environmental requirements  including air quality regulation 
for a more detailed discussion of these and other environmental issues  refer to part ii  item md a environmental matters 
idaho power s environmental compliance costs will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future  especially with potential additional regulation under discussion at the state and federal levels 
idaho power estimates its environmental expenditures  based upon present environmental laws and regulations  will be as follows for the periods indicated  excluding allowance for funds used during construction afudc in millions of dollars environmental expenditures capital expenditures studies and measures at hydroelectric facilities investments in equipment and facilities at thermal plants total capital expenditures operating expenses operating costs for environmental facilities hydroelectric operating costs for environmental facilities thermal total operations and maintenance idaho power anticipates that a number of new and impending epa rulemakings and proceedings addressing  among other things  ozone and fine particulate matter pollution  emissions  and disposal of coal combustion residuals could result in substantially increased operating and compliance costs in addition to the amounts set forth above

risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report  the risk factors set forth below may have a significant impact on the business  financial condition  or results of operations of idacorp and idaho power and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements 
if the idaho public utilities commission  the oregon public utility commission  or the federal energy regulatory commission grant less rate recovery in regulatory proceedings than idaho power needs to cover existing and future costs and earn a rate of return  earnings and cash flows may be reduced 
the prices that the idaho public utilities commission and oregon public utility commission authorize idaho power to charge for its retail services  and the tariff rate that the federal energy regulatory commission permits idaho power to charge for transmission  are generally the most significant factors influencing idacorp s and idaho power s financial position  results of operations  and liquidity 
the idaho public utilities commission and oregon public utility commission have the authority to disallow recovery of any costs that they consider unreasonable or imprudently incurred 
also  the rates allowed by the federal energy regulatory commission for transmission service may be insufficient for recovery of costs incurred 
while the idaho public utilities commission and oregon public utility commission have established an authorized rate of return for idaho power  the regulatory process does not provide assurance that idaho power will be able to achieve the authorized rate of return 
further  while the idaho public utilities commission and oregon public utility commission are required to establish rates that are fair  just  and reasonable  they have considerable discretion in applying this standard 
the ratemaking process typically involves multiple parties  including governmental bodies  consumer advocacy groups  and customers 
while each party has differing concerns  they often have the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates 
idaho power cannot predict the outcome of ratemaking proceedings  including the extent to which costs  including the costs of significant capital projects  will be recovered or what rates of return will be authorized 
the failure of idaho power to recover those costs  or recover them in a timely manner  may decrease idacorp s and idaho power s earnings and adversely impact cash flows 
for additional information relating to idaho power s regulatory framework  see note regulatory matters to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and regulatory matters in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report 
idaho power s cost recovery deferral mechanisms may not function as intended  which may adversely affect cash flows and liquidity 
idaho power has power cost adjustment mechanisms that provide for periodic adjustments to the rates charged to its idaho and oregon retail customers 
the power cost adjustment tracks idaho power s actual net power supply costs primarily fuel and purchased power less off system sales and compares these amounts to net power supply costs currently being recovered in retail rates 
a majority  but not all  of the variance between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from  or refund to  customers 
accordingly  the power cost adjustment mechanisms only partially offset the potentially adverse financial impacts of forced generating plant outages  severe weather  reduced hydroelectric generation  and volatile wholesale energy prices 
because of the power cost adjustment mechanisms  the primary financial impact of power supply cost variations is on the timing of cash flows 
when costs rise above the level recovered in retail base rates it adversely affects idaho power s operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered from customers 
idaho power also has a fixed cost adjustment  which began as a pilot program for idaho power s idaho residential and small general service customers  running from through the fixed cost adjustment is designed to remove idaho power s disincentive to invest in energy efficiency programs by separating or decoupling the recovery of fixed costs from the variable kilowatt hour charge  and linking it instead to a set amount per customer 
in october  idaho power filed an application with the idaho public utilities commission requesting that the fixed cost adjustment pilot program become permanent 
as of the date of this report  the idaho public utilities commission has not issued a determination 
if the fixed cost adjustment is not approved as permanent  or if the idaho public utilities commission modifies the fixed cost adjustment in some manner  idaho power may incur fixed costs that may not be recoverable in rates in times of declining usage per residential and small general service customer  or may recover more than the fixed costs incurred in times of increasing usage per residential and small general service customer 
this over or under collection of fixed costs would likely continue until idaho power s next idaho general rate case when the recovery of fixed costs through base rates can be realigned  which could adversely affect idaho power s cash flows and liquidity 
for additional information relating to idaho power s regulatory framework and cost recovery mechanisms  see note regulatory matters to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and regulatory matters in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report 
reduced hydroelectric generation can reduce revenues and increase costs  and reduce earnings and cash flows 
idaho power derives a significant portion of its power supply from its hydroelectric facilities 
because of idaho power s heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation  the availability of water can significantly affect its operations 
when hydroelectric generation is reduced  idaho power must increase its use of generally more expensive thermal generating resources and purchased power  therefore  opportunities for off system sales are reduced  which reduces revenues 
the further integration of wind and other intermittent power sources into idaho power s system may also displace lower cost hydroelectric resources 
integration of intermittent power sources may also increase costs at thermal plants due to wear and tear associated with frequent start up and shut down of those facilities to balance loads 
while idaho power expects to recover  as a result of its power cost adjustment mechanisms  the majority of its net power supply costs above current rates including the power cost adjustment forecast  recovery of the excess amounts may not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year  impacting cash flows and liquidity 
declines in stream flows and over appropriation of water in idaho may reduce hydroelectric generation and revenues and increase costs  and reduce earnings and cash flows 
the combination of declining snake river base flows  over appropriation of water  and periods of drought have led to water rights disputes and proceedings among surface water and ground water irrigators and the state of idaho 
recharging the eastern snake plain aquifer by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one proposed solution to the over appropriation dispute 
diversions from the snake river for aquifer recharge or the loss of water rights may further reduce snake river flows available for hydroelectric generation 
idaho power s january settlement agreement with the state of idaho resolves litigation regarding certain idaho power water rights on the snake river and provides for ongoing snake river water issues to be addressed in a comprehensive aquifer management plan process 
however  there is no assurance that this process will lead to increased snake river stream flows for idaho power s hydroelectric projects 
the comprehensive aquifer management plan process and the resolution of pending proceedings relating to the snake river may affect snake river flows available for hydroelectric generation and thereby reduce idaho power s revenues and increase costs  and may reduce earnings and cash flows 
idaho power s reliance on coal and natural gas to fuel its power generation facilities exposes it to risk of increased costs and reduced earnings 
in addition to hydroelectric generation  idaho power relies on coal and natural gas to fuel its generation facilities 
as part of its normal business operations  idaho power purchases power and natural gas in the open market or under short term  long term  or variable priced contracts 
market prices for coal and natural gas are influenced by factors impacting supply and demand  such as weather conditions  fuel transmission or transportation availability  economic conditions  and changes in technology 
increases in demand for coal or natural gas may result in market price increases  short term price volatility  and supply availability issues 
any disruption in idaho power s fuel supply may require the company to find alternative fuel sources at higher costs  to produce power from higher cost generation facilities  or to purchase power from other sources at higher costs 
idaho power may not be able to fully recover these increased costs through ratemaking  which may reduce earnings 
further  idaho power s power cost adjustment mechanisms contain a cost sharing feature that does not in all circumstances provide for full recovery of incurred costs in customer rates 
idaho power s power generating facilities are subject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry 
operating risks associated with idaho power s generation facilities include equipment failures  volatility in fuel and transportation pricing  interruptions in fuel supplies  increased regulatory compliance costs  labor disputes  workforce safety matters  the loss of cost effective disposal options for solid waste  operator error  and the occurrence of catastrophic events at the facilities 
diminished availability or performance of idaho power s transmission and distribution facilities could result in reduced customer satisfaction and regulatory inquiries and fines 
operation of idaho power s owned and co owned generating stations below expected capacity levels  or unplanned outages at these stations  could cause reduced energy output and lower efficiency levels and result in lost revenues and increased expenses 
these operational risks may result in plant outages  as well as increased operation and maintenance expenses  power generation costs  and power purchase costs  which could have an adverse impact on earnings and cash flows 
load changes in idaho power s service territory expose idaho power to greater market and operational risk and could increase costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
while idaho power s customer growth rate has slowed in recent years  increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy have resulted and may continue to result in increased reliance on purchased power to meet peak system demand 
while idaho power is exploring targeted opportunities for managed load growth  load growth can create planning and operating difficulties for idaho power that can negatively impact its ability to reliably serve customers 
through current regulatory mechanisms  idaho power can expect to recover the majority of the net power supply costs above the amounts included in its rates  though recovery of the excess amounts does not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year  and the remaining amount is absorbed by idaho power  which could increase costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
load growth can also result in the need for additional investments in idaho power s infrastructure to serve the new load 
for instance  to meet customer demand idaho power is currently constructing its langley gulch natural gas fired generating plant  and has in development a number of transmission projects 
if idaho power is unable to secure timely rate relief from the idaho public utilities commission  the oregon public utility commission  or the federal energy regulatory commission to recover the costs of these additional investments  the resulting disconnect between the time investments are made and costs are recovered would have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows 
further  while idaho power has experienced a general trend of load growth in its service territory in recent years  increased emphasis on energy efficiency and weak economic conditions could result in a decline in loads  which may decrease idaho power s revenues from energy sales 
also  idaho power s regulatory mechanisms  including its load change adjustment rate included in its power cost adjustment  may not result in idaho power recovering all of its costs associated with load decreases  which would have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows 
federally mandated purchases of power from purpa power purchase projects  and integration of power generated from those projects into idaho power s system  may increase costs and decrease system reliability  and adversely affect cash flows  financial condition  and earnings 
an abundance of intermittent  non dispatchable wind power generation at times when idaho power has available lower cost resources to meet load demands has an impact on the operation of idaho power s hydroelectric generation plants  system reliability  power supply costs  and the wholesale power markets in the pacific northwest 
wind power generated from purpa projects  which idaho power is generally obligated to purchase regardless of the then current load demand or wholesale energy market prices  increases the likelihood and frequency that idaho power will be required to reduce output from its lower cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel fired generation resources  even when weather conditions have resulted in favorable hydroelectric generation conditions or fuel prices are low 
wind generation in the pacific northwest during periods when abundant hydroelectric generation is also available reduces wholesale market prices 
this may result in idaho power s sale of excess wind power at a significant discount to the price idaho power paid for the wind power under purpa wind power purchase contracts 
it may also result in the sale of excess lower cost hydroelectric or fuel based power at depressed wholesale market prices 
when forecasted wind or other intermittent resources do not materialize  idaho power must obtain a substitute source of power to meet load demand  and often must purchase power in the wholesale power markets to balance loads 
further  balancing load and generation from idaho power s power generation portfolio is challenging  and idaho power expects that its costs will increase as a result of its efforts to integrate intermittent  non dispatchable power from a large number of purpa power projects 
idaho power anticipates that those costs will escalate as the volume of wind and other intermittent power on idaho power s system increases  which may adversely affect idacorp s and idaho power s cash flows  financial condition  and earnings 
weather and climate change could affect customer demand and hydroelectric generation and disrupt transmission and distribution systems  reducing earnings and cash flows 
warmer than normal winters  cooler than normal summers  and increased rainfall during the irrigation seasons reduce retail revenues from power sales and may impact the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation 
changes in the amount and timing of snowpack and stream flows may also adversely affect hydroelectric generation 
extreme weather events and their associated impacts  such as high winds and fires  can disrupt transmission and distribution systems and cause service interruptions and extended outages  increase supply chain costs  potentially interrupt use of generation resources  and limit idaho power s ability to meet customer energy demand 
rapid increases in load requirements resulting from unexpected adverse weather changes  particularly if coupled with transmission constraints or system damage  could adversely impact idaho power s costs and ability to meet customer energy demand 
conversely  rapid decreases in load requirements due to unexpected weather events could result in idaho power s sale of excess energy at depressed wholesale market prices 
disruption in generation  transmission  and distribution systems due to weather related factors also increases operations and maintenance expenses and reduces earnings and cash flows 
long term climate change could increase the likelihood and frequency of these adverse weather events 
further  legislative and or regulatory developments associated with climate change could affect construction plans and operations  including placing restrictions on the construction of new generation resources and the expansion of existing resources  result in closure of generation resources or installation of costly pollution control equipment  or require changes to the operation of generation resources and idaho power s power generation portfolio in general 
also  consumer preference for renewable or low greenhouse gas emitting sources of energy could impact demand from existing sources and require significant investment in new generation and transmission resources 
any of these effects of weather and climate change could decrease revenues  increase operating costs  and reduce idacorp s and idaho power s earnings and cash flows 
in idaho power s service territory  demand for power peaks during the hot summer months  often concurrent with a seasonal increase in wholesale power market prices 
as a result  idaho power s operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis 
in addition  idaho power will generally sell less power  and correspondingly have lower net income  when weather conditions in its service areas are milder 
unusually mild weather in the future could diminish idacorp s and idaho power s results of operations and adversely affect its financial condition 
idaho power s risk management policy and programs relating to economically hedging power and gas exposures  financial and interest rate risk  and counterparty creditworthiness may not always perform as intended  and as a result idaho power may suffer economic losses 
idaho power enters into transactions to hedge its positions in coal  natural gas  power  and other commodities 
these hedging transactions are impacted by a range of factors  including variations in power demand  fluctuations in market prices  and market prices for alternative commodities 
in connection with these hedging transactions  idaho power is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe it money will default on their obligations 
a similar risk of non performance by third parties arises where those parties are obligated to purchase energy from  or sell energy to  idaho power  or are parties to commodity price risk management arrangements 
idaho power actively manages the market risk inherent in its energy related activities and counterparty credit positions by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management policies 
idaho power has procedures that monitor compliance with its risk management policies and programs  including verification of transactions  regular portfolio reporting of various risk management metrics  and daily counterparty credit risk analysis 
however  actual hydroelectric and thermal generation  power purchase volumes from intermittent sources  transmission availability  and market prices may be significantly different than those originally planned for when idaho power enters into its positions in hedging transactions 
this creates uncertainty in the appropriate amount of hedging activity to pursue 
forecasts of future loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause idaho power to over or under hedge actual resource needs  exposing the company to market risk on the over or under hedged position 
changes in market prices are also unpredictable and can at times result in idaho power s hedged positions performing less favorably than unhedged positions 
in addition  idaho power s counterparty credit policies may not prevent counterparties from failing to perform  forcing the company to replace forward contracts with transactions in the open market  where the price for the particular commodity may at that time be higher 
as a result  risk management decisions may adversely affect idacorp s and idaho power s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
also  as part of idacorp s and idaho power s risk management programs  they may use a variety of non derivative and derivative financial instruments  such as swaps  futures  and forwards  to manage market risks 
they may also use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge against interest rate fluctuations related to debt 
in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources  the valuation of some of the derivative instruments involves management s judgment or use of estimates 
as a result  changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of some of the contracts 
idacorp or idaho power could also recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform  which could adversely affect idacorp s or idaho power s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
idaho power s ability to enter into swaps and derivatives and hedge commodity and interest rate risk may be adversely affected by recent federal legislation 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act was signed into law in july the dodd frank act establishes regulatory jurisdiction by the commodity futures trading commission and the securities and exchange commission for certain swaps and derivative instruments and the users of those instruments 
a number of federal agencies  including the commodity futures trading commission and the securities and exchange commission  must adopt rules to implement the dodd frank act 
as idaho power enters into swap and derivative transactions from time to time in connection with its general business operations  these rules  when implemented  could have a significant impact on idaho power and will likely increase the costs idaho power incurs in connection with its swap and derivative transactions 
under the rules  idaho power may be required to post collateral to meet minimum capital and margin requirements 
the dodd frank act also requires a broad category of swaps to be cleared and traded on registered exchanges or special derivatives exchanges 
these clearing requirements would result in a significant change from idaho power s current practice of bilateral transactions and negotiated credit terms 
the dodd frank act outlines an elective exemption to the clearing requirements for swaps entered into by end users that are not major swap participants or swap dealers and that enter into hedges to mitigate their own commercial risk 
although idaho power expects that its swaps will qualify under the end user exemption  there can be no assurance they will qualify 
further  even if idaho power s swaps were to qualify under the end user exemption  it will not be exempt from all swap related requirements of the dodd frank act  and counterparties that are swap dealers or major swap participants may seek to pass along the increased cost and margin requirements through higher prices and reductions in unsecured credit limits 
the occurrence of these events could have an adverse effect on idacorp s and idaho power s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
capital expenditures for power generation and delivery infrastructure and replacement of that infrastructure can significantly affect liquidity 
idaho power s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in energy generation and other infrastructure projects 
long term increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of transmission and distribution systems  generating facilities  and other infrastructure 
for instance  idaho power is currently constructing the langley gulch power plant and is in the permitting process for two substantial kv transmission line projects 
the cost of maintaining existing  aging equipment and infrastructure and developing new infrastructure is substantial  and involves risks relating to  among other things  cost overruns  system outages  price increases in commodities such as steel and copper  and denial by regulatory bodies of recovery through rates of costs incurred 
idaho power may not be successful in limiting capital expenditures to planned amounts  particularly in the event of escalating costs for materials and labor 
if idaho power does not receive timely regulatory recovery of costs associated with those expansion and reinforcement activities  idaho power will have to rely more heavily on external debt or equity financing for its future capital expenditures 
these large capital expenditures may weaken the consolidated financial profile of idacorp and idaho power 
additionally  a significant portion of idaho power s facilities were constructed many years ago  which could affect reliability  increase repair and maintenance expenses  and increase reliance on market purchases of power 
the performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs could adversely affect cash flows and liquidity 
idaho power provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees  as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan consisting of health care and death benefits that covers eligible retirees 
costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plans assets and  therefore  adverse investment performance for these assets could increase idaho power s funding requirements related to the plans 
the key actuarial assumptions that affect funding obligations are the expected long term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations 
idaho power evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis  taking into account changes in market conditions  trends  and future expectations 
estimates of future equity and debt market performance  changes in interest rates  and other factors idaho power and its actuary firms use to develop the actuarial assumptions are uncertain  and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates 
changes in demographics  including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions  may also increase idaho power s funding requirements for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
future pension funding requirements  and the timing of funding payments  may also be subject to changes in legislation 
depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and the availability of recovery of costs through rates  cash contributions to the plans could reduce the cash available for operating activities 
for additional information regarding idaho power s funding obligations under its benefit plans  see note benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
idaho power s business is subject to substantial governmental regulation  including environmental laws and mandatory reliability standards  which could increase costs 
idaho power is subject to an extensive body of federal and state laws  policies  and regulations  as well as regulatory actions and regulatory audits  including those of the federal energy regulatory commission  the environmental protection agency  the north american electric reliability corporation  the western electricity coordinating council  and the public utility commissions in idaho  oregon  and wyoming 
some of these regulations are changing or subject to interpretation  and failure to comply may result in penalties or other adverse consequences 
as an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system  idaho power is subject to mandatory reliability standards issued by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the federal energy regulatory commission 
the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles 
compliance with reliability standards subjects idaho power to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures 
further  idaho power has received notice of violations from  and self reported reliability standard compliance issues to  the federal energy regulatory commission  the north american electric reliability corporation  and the western electricity coordinating council  and has several matters pending 
potential monetary and non monetary penalties for a violation of federal energy regulatory commission regulations may be substantial  and in some circumstances monetary penalties may be as high as million per day per violation 
the imposition of penalties on idaho power could have an adverse impact on its and idacorp s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
idaho power is also subject to extensive federal  state  and local environmental statutes  rules  and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  natural resources  and health and safety 
compliance with these environmental statutes  rules  and regulations involves significant capital and operating expenditures and carries with it the risk of penalties and fines 
these laws and regulations generally require idaho power to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses  permits  inspections  and other approvals  and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals 
idaho power cannot predict the outcome or effect of any action or litigation that may arise from applicable environmental regulations 
in addition  idaho power cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs or mitigation measures 
there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 
environmental regulations may also require idaho power to install pollution control equipment at  or perform environmental remediation on  its or its co owned facilities  often at a substantial cost 
emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides  mercury  and particulates from fossil fueled generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulations  controls  and mitigation expenses 
certain federal legislators  environmental advocacy groups  and regulatory agencies in the united states have also been focusing considerable attention on co and other emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change and or regional air quality compliance 
existing environmental regulations regarding air emissions such as nox  so  or mercury emissions  water quality  and other toxic pollutants may be revised or new climate change laws or regulations may be adopted or become applicable to idaho power 
moreover  there are many legislative and rulemaking initiatives pending at the federal and state level that are aimed at the reduction of fossil fuel plant emissions 
idaho power cannot predict the outcome of pending or future legislative and rulemaking proposals 
future changes in environmental laws or regulations governing emissions reduction could make certain electric generating units especially coal fired units uneconomical and subject to shut down  could require the adoption of new methodologies or technologies that significantly increase costs or delay in service dates  and may raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities 
modification of existing environmental regulations or adoption of new environmental regulations may result in increased capital expenditures and could increase the cost of operating idaho power s generating plants or make them uneconomical to operate and result in reduced earnings and cash flows 
furthermore  idaho power may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for operation of its facilities and execution of its long term strategy  including construction of new transmission and distribution infrastructure 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if idaho power fails to obtain  maintain  or comply with any such approval  construction and or operation of idaho power s owned or co owned generation and or transmission facilities could be delayed  halted  or subjected to additional costs 
complying with state or federal renewable portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
a number of states have adopted renewable portfolio standards  which require that electricity providers obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy sources by a specified date 
idaho power s operations in oregon will be required to comply with a ten percent renewable portfolio standard beginning in  and it is possible that other states  including idaho  could adopt renewable portfolio standards that are applicable to idaho power in the future 
the cost of purchasing or generating power from renewable energy sources is often greater than fossil fuel and hydroelectric generation sources  and construction of renewable energy facilities involves significant capital expenditures 
as a result  new state or federal renewable portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
the listing as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act of fish  wildlife  or plant species that are found in the areas of idaho power s generation facilities or transmission lines may require mitigation  affect the location of a project or the ability to construct a project  and increase capital expenditures and operating costs 
relicensing of the hells canyon and swan falls hydroelectric projects and construction of the gateway west and boardman to hemingway transmission lines requires consultation under the endangered species act to determine the effects of these projects on any listed species within the project areas 
the listing of species as threatened or endangered  including the relatively recent listing of slickspot peppergrass as a threatened species  will result in an endangered species act consultation for the gateway west and boardman to hemingway transmission lines and future transmission projects 
similarly  the presence of sage grouse in the vicinity of the gateway west and boardman to hemingway transmission projects has required more extensive  costly  and time consuming evaluation and engineering 
these and other requirements of the endangered species act and similar laws may increase costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
conditions imposed in connection with hydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures  increase operating costs  reduce hydroelectric generation  and reduce earnings and cash flows 
idaho power is currently involved in renewing federal licenses for some of its hydroelectric projects  including its largest hydroelectric generation source  the hells canyon complex 
relicensing includes an extensive public review process that involves numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions 
the listing of various species of marine life  wildlife  and plants as threatened or endangered has resulted in significant changes to federally authorized activities  including those of hydroelectric projects 
in particular  fish and other marine life recovery plans may require major operational changes to the region s hydroelectric projects 
in addition  new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to hydroelectric facilities  which could further increase required expenditures for marine life recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydroelectric generation available to meet idaho power s energy requirements 
in  the federal energy regulatory commission staff issued a final environmental impact statement for the hells canyon complex  which the federal energy regulatory commission will use in part to determine whether  and under what conditions  to issue a new license for the hells canyon complex 
certain portions of the final environmental impact statement involve issues that may be influenced by water quality certifications for the project under section of the clean water act and formal consultations under the endangered species act  which remain unresolved 
one significant issue involves water temperature gradients  and certain parties in the hells canyon complex relicensing proceedings have advocated for the installation of water temperature management apparatus which  if required to be installed  would require substantial capital expenditures to construct and maintain 
there can be no assurance that recovery through rates would be authorized  particularly given the magnitude of any potential impact on customer rates  which at this time cannot be predicted with certainty 
idaho power also cannot predict the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing process  the economic impact of those requirements  or whether a new multi year license will ultimately be issued 
imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensing process could result in idaho power incurring significant capital expenditures  increase operating costs  and reduce hydroelectric generation  which could reduce earnings and cash flows 
idacorp  idaho power  and their subsidiaries are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings  settlements  investigations  and claims 
from time to time in the normal course of business  idacorp  idaho power  and their subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory proceedings  lawsuits  and claims that could result in adverse judgments  settlements  fines  penalties  injunctions  or other relief 
these matters are subject to a number of uncertainties  and as a result management is often unable to predict the outcome of a matter 
the final resolution of matters in which idacorp  idaho power  or their subsidiaries are involved could require that they incur costs in a range of amounts that could have an adverse effect on their cash flows and results of operations 
similarly  the terms of resolution could require the companies to change their business practices and procedures  which could also have an adverse effect on their cash flows  financial positions  or results of operations 
idacorp  idacorp energy  and idaho power are involved in a number of proceedings  including proceedings arising from the california energy crisis and the energy shortages  high prices  and blackouts in the western united states during and  and a refund proceeding affecting sellers of wholesale power in the spot market in the pacific northwest 
idaho power may also be subject to costs and other effects of additional legal claims  actions  and complaints  including those related to the jim bridger  valmy  and boardman coal fired plants  in which idaho power holds an ownership interest 
for instance  in september the environmental protection agency issued a notice of violation to portland general electric company  the majority owner of the boardman plant  alleging violations of the new source performance standards and operating permit requirements under the clean air act as a result of prior modifications made to the plant 
private parties have also brought tort actions against companies relating to their alleged contribution to climate change  including claims relating to the jim bridger and boardman power plants 
if idacorp  idaho power  or their subsidiaries are required to make payments in connection with any legal or regulatory proceeding  settlement  investigation  or claim  earnings and cash flows could be negatively affected 
as a holding company  idacorp does not have its own operating income and must rely on the upstream cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments 
idacorp is a holding company with no significant operations of its own  and its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries  primarily idaho power 
consequently  idacorp s ability to pay dividends and to service its debt is dependent upon dividends and other payments received from its subsidiaries 
idacorp s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to idacorp  whether through dividends  loans  or other payments 
the ability of idacorp s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to idacorp depends on several factors  including each subsidiaries actual and projected earnings and cash flow  capital requirements and general financial condition  regulatory restrictions  covenants contained in credit facilities to which they are parties  and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equity securities 
further  the amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors  which reviews the appropriateness of dividends in light of current and long term financial position and results of operations  capital requirements  rating agency requirements  contractual and regulatory restrictions  legislative and regulatory developments affecting the electric utility industry in general and idaho power in particular  competitive conditions  and any other factors the board of directors deems relevant 
any of these factors may result in a reduction or cessation of dividends 
see part ii  item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters  and issuer purchases of equity securities of this report for a description of restrictions on idacorp s and idaho power s payment of dividends 
a downgrade in idacorp s and idaho power s credit ratings could affect the companies ability to access capital  increase their cost of borrowing  and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties 
access to capital markets is important to idaho power s ability to operate and to complete its capital projects  including its current and planned generation and transmission projects 
credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long term ratings of idacorp and idaho power  and these ratings impact access to  and the cost of  borrowing 
idacorp and idaho power also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper  a principal source of short term financing 
downgrades of idacorp s or idaho power s credit ratings  or those affecting relationship banks  could limit the companies ability to access capital  including the commercial paper markets  require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt  and require the companies to post additional performance assurance collateral with transaction counterparties 
volatility in the financial markets  or denial of regulatory authority to issue debt or equity securities  may negatively affect idacorp s and idaho power s ability to access capital and or increase their cost of borrowing  or result in losses on investments 
idacorp and idaho power require liquidity to pay operating expenses and principal of  and interest on  debt and to finance capital expenditures not satisfied by cash flows from operations 
financial markets have in recent years experienced extreme volatility and disruption  generally resulting in a decrease in the availability of liquidity and credit for borrowers 
in a volatile credit environment  one or more of the participating banks in idacorp s and idaho power s credit facilities may default on their obligations to make loans under  or withdraw from  the credit facilities  or idacorp s and idaho power s access to capital may otherwise be inhibited 
in addition  at times idaho power has a relatively large balance of short term investments 
volatility in the financial markets may result in a lack of liquidity for short term investments and declines in value of some investments 
the occurrence of any of these events could affect idaho power s ability to execute its business plan and adversely affect idacorp s and idaho power s earnings  liquidity  and financial condition 
further  idaho power is required to obtain regulatory approval in idaho  oregon  and wyoming in order to borrow money or to issue securities and is therefore dependent on the public utility commissions of those states to issue favorable orders in a timely manner to permit them to finance their operations 
notably  without additional approval from those commissions  the aggregate amount of short term borrowings by idaho power at any one time outstanding may not exceed million 
national and regional economic conditions  in conjunction with increased electric rates  may cause increased late payments and uncollectible customer accounts  or reduce energy consumption  which would reduce earnings and cash flows 
beginning in  economic conditions in idaho power s service area have been relatively weak 
unemployment rates are high relative to historic unemployment levels and customer growth has been slow relative to prior years 
these factors may reduce the amount of energy idaho power s customers consume  result in a loss of customers  increase the likelihood and prevalence of late payments and uncollectible accounts  and reduce the customer growth rate 
a resulting decrease in overall customer usage or collections may reduce revenues and earnings 
changes in tax laws and regulations  or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions  could have a material adverse impact on idacorp s or idaho power s financial condition 
idacorp and idaho power must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes 
the companies tax obligations include income  real estate  public utility  municipal  sales and use  business and occupation  and employment related taxes and ongoing issues related to these taxes 
these judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by taxing authorities 
for instance  recent income tax method changes had a significant impact on financial results in the outcome of ongoing and future income tax proceedings could differ materially from the amounts idacorp and idaho power record prior to conclusion of those proceedings  and the difference could reduce idacorp s and idaho power s earnings and cash flows 
further  in some instances the treatment from a ratemaking perspective of any tax benefits could be different than idacorp or idaho power anticipate or request from applicable state regulatory commissions 
the idaho public utilities commission or oregon public utility commission could  for instance  determine that all or a portion of any benefits resulting from tax related projects be shared with customers in the form of reduced rates or otherwise  which may reduce revenue  earnings  and cash flows 
employee workforce factors could increase costs and reduce earnings 
idaho power is subject to workforce factors  including loss or retirement of key personnel  availability of qualified personnel  an aging workforce  and impacts of efforts to organize workforce  including the possible unionization of one or more segments of the workforce 
idaho power s operations require a skilled workforce to perform specialized  complex utility functions 
idaho power expects that a significant portion of its skilled workforce will be retiring  at a rate higher than idaho power s historical rate  within the next ten years  which places demand on idaho power to attract and retain skilled workers 
without a skilled workforce  idaho power s ability to provide quality service to its customers and meet regulatory requirements will be challenged and could affect earnings 
also  the costs associated with attracting and retaining appropriately qualified employees to replace an aging and skilled workforce could reduce earnings and cash flows 
acts or threats of terrorism  cyber attacks  security breaches  and other acts of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt idaho power s operations  or the businesses of third parties  could result in reduced revenues and increased costs 
idaho power s generation and transmission facilities are potential targets for terrorist acts and threats  as well as cyber attacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups 
some of idaho power s facilities are deemed critical infrastructure  in that incapacity or destruction of the facilities could have a debilitating impact on security  reliability or operability of the bulk electric power system  national economic security  national public health or safety  or any combination of those matters 
the possibility that infrastructure facilities  such as generation facilities and electric transmission facilities  would be direct targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror or cyber attack whether originating internally or externally may affect idaho power s operations by limiting the ability to generate  purchase  or transmit power and by delaying the development and construction of new generating and transmission facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities 
these events  and governmental actions in response  could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure idaho power s assets  and could further adversely affect idaho power s operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas or coal used to fuel gas fired or coal fired power plants 
because generation and transmission are part of an interconnected system  idaho power faces the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the impact of an event on the interconnected system 
the events could also impair idacorp s and idaho power s ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity 
further  the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased compliance costs 
in the normal course of business  idaho power collects  processes  and retains sensitive and confidential customer and proprietary information  and operates systems that directly impact the availability of electric power and the transmission of electric power in the electric grid 
idaho power operates in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure 
despite the security measures in place  idaho power s facilities and systems  and those of third party service providers  could be vulnerable to security breaches  data leakage  or other similar events that could interrupt operations  resulting in a shutdown of service and exposing idaho power to liability 
those breaches and events may result from acts of idaho power employees  contractors  or third parties 
if idaho power s technology systems were to fail or be breached and idaho power were unable to recover the systems and or data in a timely manner  idaho power may be unable to fulfill critical business functions 
also  confidential and proprietary business  employee  or customer information could be compromised  exposing idaho power to liability and causing business disruptions  which could have a material adverse effect on idaho power s operations and idacorp s and idaho power s financial results 
the implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance  to the extent available  addressing such activities could increase costs and impact financial results 
in addition  these types of events could require significant management attention and resources  and could adversely affect idacorp s and idaho power s reputation among customers and the public

introduction in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  the general financial condition and results of operations for idacorp  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  idacorp and idaho power company and its subsidiary collectively  idaho power are discussed 
while reading the md a  please refer to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of idacorp and idaho power 
idacorp is a holding company formed in whose principal operating subsidiary is idaho power 
idacorp s common stock is listed and trades on the new york stock exchange under the trading symbol ida 
idaho power is an electric utility with a service territory covering approximately  square miles in southern idaho and eastern oregon 
idaho power provided electric service to approximately  general business customers as of december  as a regulated utility  many of idaho power s fundamental business decisions are subject to the approval of governmental agencies 
idaho power is under the retail jurisdiction as to rates  service  accounting  and other general matters of utility operation of the idaho public utilities commission ipuc and the oregon public utility commission opuc  which determine the rates that idaho power charges to its general business customers 
also  as a public utility under the federal power act  idaho power has authority to charge market based rates for wholesale energy sales under its federal energy regulatory commission ferc tariff and to provide transmission services under its ferc open access transmission tariff oatt 
idaho power uses general rate cases  cost adjustment mechanisms  and subject specific filings to recover its costs of providing service and the costs of its energy efficiency and demand side resources programs  and to seek to earn a return on investment 
idaho power generates revenues and cash flows primarily from the sale and distribution of electricity to customers in its idaho and oregon service territories  as well as from the wholesale sale and transmission of electricity 
idaho power s revenues and income from operations are subject to fluctuations during the year due to the impacts of seasonal weather conditions on demand for electricity  availability of water for hydroelectric generation  price changes  customer usage patterns which are affected in large part by the condition of the local economy  and the availability and price of purchased power and fuel 
idaho power is a dual peaking utility that typically experiences its highest retail energy sales during the summer irrigation and cooling season  with a lower peak in the winter that generally results from heating demand 
idacorp s and idaho power s financial condition is also affected by regulatory decisions  through which idaho power seeks to recover its costs on a timely basis  and to earn an authorized return on investment  and by the ability to obtain financing through the issuance of debt and or equity securities 
idacorp s other subsidiaries include idacorp financial services  inc ifs  an investor in affordable housing and other real estate investments  ida west energy company  an operator of small hydroelectric generation projects that satisfy the requirements of the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa  and idacorp energy  a marketer of energy commodities  which wound down operations in idaho power is the parent of idaho energy resources co 
ierco  a joint venturer in bridger coal company bcc  which mines and supplies coal to the jim bridger generating plant owned in part by idaho power 
executive overview overview of financial results idacorp s earnings were per diluted share for the year ended december  compared to and per diluted share in and  respectively 
idacorp s earnings in were impacted by the approval of a tax method change that allowed idaho power to recognize during million in tax benefits relating to tax years and prior 
this tax benefit  combined with the results of ongoing operations  triggered sharing mechanisms in idaho that reduced operating income by million  reflecting earnings to be shared with idaho customers to reduce rates 
in addition  results include the full year impact of base rate increases implemented in  higher electricity sales volumes  and lower pca rates 
accomplishments and challenges and areas of emphasis idacorp s business strategy emphasizes idaho power as idacorp s core business 
idaho power has a three part strategy of responsible planning  responsible development and protection of resources  and responsible energy use to ensure adequate energy supplies 
this strategy is described in part i  item business of this report 
examples of idaho power s achievements during under its three part business strategy include execution of idaho power s purposeful regulatory strategy  which resulted in settlement of idaho power s idaho general rate case with the ipuc including a base rate increase effective january   a june  base rate increase for recovery of the idaho allocated portion of idaho power s cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plan  and several other positive regulatory decisions  execution of a settlement agreement with the ipuc extending through idaho power s ability to amortize additional accumulated deferred investment tax credits aditc to help achieve a minimum annual return on year end equity in the idaho jurisdiction idaho roe of percent  significant progress toward cost sharing agreements with other parties for the permitting of the boardman to hemingway and gateway west kv transmission projects  which were ultimately executed in january  completion of deployment of smart meters to substantially all customers  continued progress on the construction of the langley gulch power plant  approval by the us congress joint committee on taxation joint committee of a tax method change for uniform capitalization  resulting in a significant increase in net income relative to  and ranking in the top quartile of the largest utilities in the country for customer satisfaction in the jd power and associates electric utility residential customer satisfaction study 
during  idacorp s and idaho power s management will continue to focus on and implement the companies three part strategy 
notable matters that the companies expect will require management s focus and attention in include completion of construction and commencement of commercial operations of the langley gulch power plant  and timely and adequate rate recovery of costs for the plant  continued efforts toward permitting of the boardman to hemingway and gateway west transmission projects  seeking a positive outcome in proceedings at the ipuc relating to the pricing models and other terms of purpa power purchase agreements  seeking methods for the integration of intermittent power sources and anticipated increases in intermittent wind generation  which idaho power believes could have an adverse impact on system reliability and functionality and on customer rates  obtaining ipuc authorization to include idaho power s fca as a permanent component of rates  implementation of a new customer and billing system  and continued work toward resolution of issues relating to relicensing of idaho power s hydroelectric projects  including the hells canyon complex 
overview of general factors and trends affecting results of operations and financial condition idacorp s and idaho power s results of operations and financial condition are affected by regulatory  economic  and other factors  many of which are described below 
emphasis on regulatory cost recovery the prices that idaho power is authorized to charge for its electric service is a major factor in determining idacorp s and idaho power s results of operations and financial condition 
because of the significant impact of ratemaking decisions on idaho power s business and financial condition  the company continues to focus on timely recovery of its costs through filings with the company s regulators 
effective implementation of idaho power s purposeful regulatory strategy is particularly important in an economic climate that puts pressure on regulators to limit rate increases or otherwise take actions to limit the potential adverse impact of rates on customers 
regulatory developments that idacorp and idaho power expect to have an impact on their future results  each of which is discussed in more detail under regulatory matters in this md a or in note regulatory matters to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  include the following idaho general rate case and settlement on december   the ipuc approved a settlement stipulation resolving most of the issues in the general rate case 
the settlement stipulation provides for a percent authorized rate of return on an idaho jurisdictional rate base of approximately billion 
the settlement stipulation results in a million  or percent average  increase in idaho power s annual idaho jurisdictional base rate revenues  effective january  extension of certain provisions of the january settlement agreement on january   the ipuc approved a settlement agreement among idaho power  several of idaho power s customers  the ipuc staff  and others  in connection with a general rate case 
the settlement agreement included  among other items a a provision to share with idaho customers percent of any idaho jurisdiction earnings in excess of a percent idaho roe in any calendar year from to  and b a provision to allow the additional amortization of aditc if idaho power s actual idaho roe was below percent in any calendar year from to the sharing and amortization provisions of the january settlement agreement expired on december  on december   the ipuc issued an order approving a settlement stipulation providing for an extension through  with modifications  of those two provisions of the january settlement agreement 
the extension provides for up to million of additional amortization of aditc through  with certain annual limits  and additional sharing of annual earnings in excess of specified idaho roes 
in consideration for the extension  the settlement stipulation provided that idaho power would allocate to customers as a reduction to idaho power s pension regulatory asset percent of idaho power s share of idaho jurisdictional earnings over a percent idaho roe 
after the combined effect of the percent sharing mechanism in the january settlement agreement and the december settlement order that provided for additional sharing  idaho power retained percent of idaho jurisdiction earnings exceeding a percent idaho roe 
idaho pca orders in both its idaho and oregon jurisdictions  idaho power has power cost adjustment pca mechanisms that address the volatility of power supply costs and provide for annual adjustments to the rates charged to retail customers 
the idaho pca mechanism compares idaho power s actual net power supply costs to net power supply costs currently being recovered in retail rates  with most of the variance between these two amounts deferred for future recovery from  or refund to  customers 
on may   the ipuc approved a million pca decrease  effective june  this followed a may  ipuc order approving a million pca decrease  effective june  these pca rate decreases were offset by increases in power supply costs in base rates and deferrals and amortization under the pca mechanism  resulting in a relatively small impact on earnings 
idaho fca mechanism the fca is designed to remove idaho power s disincentive to invest in energy efficiency programs by separating or decoupling the recovery of fixed costs from the variable kilowatt hour charge and linking it instead to a set amount per customer 
the fca began as a pilot program in and expired on december  on october   idaho power filed an application with the ipuc requesting that the fca pilot program become permanent 
as of the date of this report  a determination and order from the ipuc as to the future of the fca is pending 
oregon general rate case on july   idaho power filed a general rate case for its oregon jurisdiction with the opuc  requesting a million increase in annual oregon jurisdictional revenues 
on february   idaho power  the opuc staff  and other interested parties executed and filed a partial settlement stipulation with the opuc that provides for a return on equity of percent and an overall rate of return of percent 
if the opuc approves the stipulation  idaho power expects that new rates will become effective on march  economic conditions and customer growth since  economic conditions in idaho power s service territory have been relatively weak 
unemployment rates remain high compared to historical levels 
after peaking at percent in early  the service area unemployment rate has fallen to percent in december  according to the idaho department of labor 
from through september  the highest monthly unemployment rate in the service territory was percent 
the customer growth rate  while still positive  has been low relative to prior years 
during  the customer growth rate in idaho power s service territory was percent 
by comparison  for the year period ending the average annual customer growth rate in idaho power s service territory was percent 
economic conditions can impact consumer demand for electricity  collectability of accounts  the volume of off system sales  and idaho power s need for purchased power 
management cannot predict the timing of  and pace at which  economic recovery may occur in idaho power s service territory 
idaho power continues to manage costs while executing its three part strategy of responsible planning  responsible development and protection of resources  and responsible energy use 
weather conditions and associated impacts weather conditions normally have a significant impact on energy sales and the seasonality of those sales 
relatively low and high temperatures result in greater energy usage for heating and cooling  respectively 
during the agricultural growing season  which in large part occurs during the second and third quarters of each calendar year  irrigation customers use electricity to operate irrigation pumps 
a percent increase in energy usage by idaho power customers during compared to is largely attributable to below average temperatures in the winter months offset by above average precipitation in the springtime  resulting in increased heating unit load and lower use of irrigation pumps 
idaho power s hydroelectric facilities comprise approximately one half of idaho power s nameplate generation capacity 
the actual availability of hydroelectric power depends on the amount of snow pack in the mountains upstream of idaho power s hydroelectric facilities  reservoir storage  springtime snow pack run off  base flows in the snake river  spring flows  rainfall  water leases and other water rights  and other weather and stream flow considerations 
at the date of this report  idaho power expects hydroelectric generation during in the range of to million mwh  based on reservoir storage levels and forecasted weather conditions as of february   compared to million mwh in and million mwh in median annual hydroelectric generation is million mwh 
due largely to favorable hydroelectric generation conditions  hydroelectric generation comprised percent of idaho power s total system generation during and percent during where favorable hydroelectric generating conditions exist for idaho power  they also may be abundant for other pacific northwest hydroelectric facility operators  thus increasing the available supply of lower cost power and depressing regional wholesale market prices  which impacts the revenue idaho power receives from off system sales of its excess power 
average wholesale power prices per mwh for sales for resale were down percent in relative to fuel and purchased power expense in addition to hydroelectric generation and power it purchases in the wholesale markets  idaho power relies significantly on coal and natural gas to fuel its generation facilities 
fuel costs are impacted by electricity sales volumes  the terms of contracts for fuel  idaho power s power generation capacity  the rate of expansion of alternative energy generation sources such as wind energy  the availability of hydroelectric generation resources  transmission capacity  energy market prices  and idaho power s hedging program for managing fuel costs 
for the year  idaho power s weighted average fuel related cost per mwh for its fossil fuel generation resources increased percent relative to  mainly due to the effect of lower generation output  which spreads fixed costs over lower output  and coal price increases 
notwithstanding the increase in fuel cost per mwh generated  total fuel expense decreased percent relative to  due to a decrease in output from fuel fired power generating plants resulting from both the abundant hydroelectric generation and increased wind power obtained through mandated power purchases pursuant to purpa 
looking ahead  operation of the langley gulch power plant that idaho power is currently constructing will increase idaho power s use of natural gas  and thus its exposure to volatility in natural gas prices 
purchased power costs are impacted by the terms of contracts for purchased power  the rate of expansion of alternative energy generation sources such as wind energy  and wholesale energy market prices 
idaho power is generally obligated to purchase power from purpa generation projects at a specified price regardless of the then current load demand or wholesale energy market prices 
this increases the likelihood that idaho power will be required to reduce output from its lower cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel fired generation resources and may be required to sell in the wholesale power market the power it purchases from purpa projects at a significant loss 
integration of intermittent  non dispatchable resources into idaho power s portfolio also creates a number of operational risks  which idaho power is working to address 
the idaho and oregon pca mechanisms mitigate in large part the potential adverse impacts of fluctuations in idaho power s power supply costs 
idaho power also uses physical and financial forward contracts for both electricity and fuel in order to manage the risks relating to fuel and power price exposures 
regulatory and environmental compliance costs and expenditures idaho power is subject to extensive federal and state laws  policies  and regulations  as well as regulatory actions and audits 
compliance with these requirements directly influences idaho power s operating environment and may significantly increase idaho power s operating costs 
further  potential monetary and non monetary penalties for a violation of applicable laws or regulations may be substantial 
accordingly  idaho power has in place numerous compliance policies and initiatives  and frequently evaluates  updates  and supplements those policies and initiatives 
in particular  environmental laws and regulations may  among other things  increase the cost of operating power generation plants and constructing new facilities  require that idaho power install additional pollution control devices at existing generating plants  or require that idaho power shut down certain power generation plants 
for instance  the boardman coal fired power plant  in which idaho power owns a percent interest  was recently the subject of proceedings with oregon regulators relating to the installation of costly emission controls and a cessation of coal fired operations in  and in september the us environmental protection agency epa issued a notice of violation relating to the boardman plant  alleging clean air act caa violations 
as legislation and regulations concerning greenhouse gas emissions develop  idaho power will assess the potential impact on the costs to operate its power generation facilities  as well as the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any required pollution control equipment upgrades 
other notable matters and areas of focus pension plans in  idaho power contributed million to its defined benefit pension plan  and in idaho power contributed an additional million to the plan 
on may   the ipuc authorized idaho power to increase its annual recovery and amortization of deferred pension costs from million to million 
idaho power expects to make additional significant cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plan through at least water management and relicensing of hydroelectric projects because of idaho power s reliance on streamflow in the snake river and its tributaries  idaho power participates in numerous proceedings and venues that may affect its water rights  seeking to preserve the long term availability of its rights for use at its hydroelectric projects 
also  idaho power is involved in renewing federal licenses for the hells canyon complex hcc  its largest hydroelectric generation source  and the swan falls hydroelectric project 
relicensing involves numerous environmental issues and substantial costs 
idaho power is working with the states of idaho and oregon  regulatory authorities  and interested parties to address concerns and take appropriate measures relating to the relicensing of idaho power s hydroelectric projects 
given the number of parties and issues involved  idaho power s relicensing costs have been and will continue to be substantial 
transmission projects idaho power continues to focus on expansion of its transmission system in an effort to improve system reliability and resource adequacy through the proposed boardman to hemingway and gateway west transmission projects 
construction of these projects cannot commence until all federal  state  and local regulatory requirements are met 
in january  idaho power entered into cost sharing arrangements with third parties for the permitting phases of both projects 
to further mitigate the risks associated with these projects  at least in part  idaho power plans to seek regulatory support for cost recovery from the ipuc and opuc for the projects prior to construction 
tax related projects in september  the us internal revenue service irs notified idaho power that idaho power s uniform capitalization tax method agreement had been approved  resulting in the recognition of million of its previously unrecognized tax benefits in summary of financial results the following is a summary idaho power s net income  net income attributable to idacorp  inc  and idacorp s earnings per diluted share for the years ended december    and in thousands  except earnings per share amounts year ended december  idaho power net income net income attributable to idacorp  inc average outstanding shares diluted s idacorp  inc earnings per diluted share the following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to idacorp  inc for to items are in millions and are before tax unless otherwise noted net income attributable to idacorp  inc december  change in idaho power net income before taxes rate and other regulatory changes  including power cost  pension expense recovery  and fixed cost adjustment mechanisms changes in sales volumes increased transmission service revenues increased other operating and maintenance expenses pension and payroll related expenses excluding pension impact of settlement stipulation below thermal plant expenses other increased depreciation expense increased property taxes other changes in operating income  net increase in idaho power operating income prior to sharing mechanisms additional pension expense as a result of settlement stipulation decrease in revenues as a result of sharing mechanism decrease in operating income as a result of sharing mechanisms change in idaho power operating income increase in afudc other net decreases increases due to tax method changes and related examination settlements change in other income tax benefit total increase in idaho power net income other net decreases net of tax net income attributable to idacorp  inc december  idaho power net income increased by million in compared to  largely as a result of approval by the us congress joint committee on taxation of the uniform capitalization method agreement with the irs  which allowed for recognition in of million of previously unrecognized tax benefits for tax years and prior 
this benefit was partially offset by million due to idaho jurisdictional sharing mechanisms 
the uniform capitalization method approval contributed to triggering of the sharing mechanism under idaho power s january settlement agreement with the ipuc and other parties 
under this sharing mechanism  idaho power recorded a million reduction in revenues to be refunded to or to otherwise benefit customers  reflecting the equal sharing of idaho jurisdiction earnings in excess of a percent idaho roe 
additionally  idaho power recorded million of additional pension expense as a result of an ipuc order approving a settlement stipulation that had been executed by idaho power  the ipuc staff  and one large industrial customer of idaho power 
the settlement stipulation provided that idaho power would allocate to customers percent of idaho power s share of idaho jurisdictional earnings over a percent idaho roe 
as agreed to with the ipuc  this allocation was used to reduce idaho power s pension regulatory asset reducing a portion of idaho customers future obligation  resulting in the corresponding recognition of additional pension expense 
other items influencing the change in idaho power s operating income and annual earnings as compared to include several rate orders went into effect in and that impacted current year revenues and had a net positive impact on operating income 
a june  base rate increase benefited with an additional five months of increased base rate revenue 
a pension expense recovery rate increase occurred on june  and was further increased on june  also included in the rate orders were pca related customer rate decreases on june of both years 
however  concurrent with each pca rate decrease was a corresponding reduction in pca expense 
these rate changes  combined with lower power supply costs net of pca mechanisms  improved operating income by approximately million for the year 
increased sales volumes improved operating income by million 
cooler temperatures early in the year contributed to an million increase in electricity demand from residential customers  many of whom rely on electric power for heating systems during the winter months 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in irrigation revenues due to a wetter  cooler spring reducing the need to use irrigation pumps 
a percent increase in cooling degree days when compared with the prior year  particularly an increase in temperature in the late summer months  drove the remaining increase 
transmission system revenues  a component of other revenues  increased million  principally resulting from increases in wheeling services attributable to increases in ferc transmission rates that took effect on october  and  and from other facility rental increases 
o m expenses increased  primarily due to an million increase in pension expense associated with the pension recovery rate orders  an increase in payroll related costs of million  and increased maintenance expense of million at the thermal plants 
these increases were partially offset by lower legal expenses of million 
depreciation expense increased million for the year due to increased plant in service 
property tax increased million in  primarily due to lower residential and commercial values in other property classes shifting tax costs to centrally assessed property 
prior to the effects of the sharing mechanisms described above  idaho power operating income increased million compared to after the effects of the sharing mechanism  operating income decreased million compared to also contributing to increased earnings at idaho power were increases of million in afudc  which represents the cost of financing construction projects with borrowed funds and equity funds 
key operating and financial metrics idacorp s and idaho power s outlook for full year metrics is as follows estimate actual idaho power operating maintenance expense millions idaho power capital expenditures  excluding afudc millions idaho power hydroelectric generation million mwh non regulated subsidiary earnings and holding company expenses millions the range for capital expenditures includes the completion of the langley gulch power plant and expenditures for the siting and permitting of major transmission expansions for the boardman to hemingway and gateway west transmission projects  net of ongoing payments from third parties participating as joint funders in the permitting project for future expenditures 
the estimated hydroelectric generation range is based on reservoir storage levels and forecasted weather conditions as of february  results of operations this section of the md a takes a closer look at the significant factors that affected idacorp s and idaho power s earnings during the year ended december  in this analysis  the results for are compared to and the results for are compared to megawatt hours mwh and dollar amounts are in thousands unless otherwise indicated 
utility operations the table below presents idaho power s energy sales  in mwh  and supply for the last three years 
year ended december  general business sales off system sales total energy sales hydroelectric generation coal generation natural gas and other generation total system generation purchased power line losses total energy supply for the year  general business sales increased by million mwh  mostly related to increased residential customer usage over the prior year 
off system sales increased by million mwh in as increases in output from hydroelectric and purpa resources increased surplus power available for sale 
due largely to favorable hydroelectric generating conditions  hydroelectric generation comprised percent of idaho power s total system generation during hydroelectric generation in was percent of the annual median generation of million mwh  which is based on hydrologic conditions for the period through and adjusted to reflect the current level of water resource development 
the million mwh reduction in hydroelectric generation in compared to was primarily due to reduced precipitation during the snow accumulation period 
the increase in hydroelectric generation during led to a decreased reliance on coal fired generation  and also contributed to the availability of additional surplus power available for off system sales 
most of the decrease in power supply costs that typically results from increased hydroelectric generation is returned to customers through the pca mechanisms 
idaho power s system is dual peaking  with the larger peak demand occurring in the summer 
to reduce the magnitude of peak demands  idaho power has implemented a demand response program and a number of energy efficiency programs 
the summer peak demand was  mw  set on july  the record summer peak demand of  mw was set on june   and the highest winter peak demand of  mw was set on december  during these and other similar heavy load periods  idaho power s system is fully committed to serve loads and meet required operating reserves 
when loads exceed idaho power s generation capacity  idaho power must rely on power obtained from purchase contracts some power from which may not be available when required if the source is intermittent power such as wind and may be required to purchase power in the wholesale energy spot market 
general business revenues the table below presents idaho power s general business revenues  mwh sales  and number of customers for the past three years 
year ended december  revenue residential commercial industrial irrigation total provision for sharing deferred revenues total general business revenues mwh residential commercial industrial irrigation total customers year end residential commercial industrial irrigation total as part of its february  general rate case order  the ipuc allowed idaho power to recover afudc for the hells canyon complex relicensing asset even though the relicensing process is not yet complete and the relicensing asset has not been placed in service 
idaho power expects to collect approximately million annually in the idaho jurisdiction  but will defer revenue recognition of the amounts collected until the license is issued and the asset is placed in service 
changes in customer demand and changes in rates are the primary causes of fluctuations in general business revenue 
the table below presents the most significant rate increases and decreases  shown on an annualized basis  which impacted revenues over the last three years 
percentage rate increase decrease annualized impact millions effective date description idaho pca idaho ami oregon general rate case settlement idaho settlement agreement idaho pca idaho pension expense recovery idaho pca idaho pension expense recovery the idaho general rate case settlement stipulation approved by the ipuc on december   resulted in a percent overall  or million annual  increase in idaho jurisdictional base rates  effective january  for more information related to the december settlement stipulation  see regulatory matters later in this md a 
the primary influences on customer demand are weather and economic conditions 
extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating  and moderate temperatures decrease sales 
precipitation levels during the agricultural growing season affect sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps  with increased precipitation reducing electricity usage 
boise  idaho weather impacts for the last three years are included in the table below 
year ended december  normal heating degree days cooling degree days heating and cooling degree days are common measures used in the utility industry to analyze the demand for electricity and indicate when a customer would use electricity for heating and air conditioning 
a degree day measures how much the average daily temperature varies from degrees 
each degree of temperature above degrees is counted as one cooling degree day  and each degree of temperature below degrees is counted as one heating degree day 
general business revenues compared to general business revenue decreased million in compared to most of the decrease is a result of recording a regulatory liability of million to be refunded to  or otherwise be used to benefit  customers  reflecting the equal sharing of idaho jurisdiction earnings exceeding the authorized return on year end equity of percent  pursuant to a january idaho settlement agreement 
the offset to this liability was recorded as a reduction to general business revenue during the third and fourth quarters of the remaining changes in general business revenue  a decrease of million for  are primarily attributable to the effects of rate changes and usage 
these factors are discussed in more detail below 
rates 
rate changes combined to reduce general business revenue by million in compared to the revenue impact of several of these changes was directly offset by associated changes in operating expenses 
for example  idaho pca amortization expense was reduced million due to decreases in the corresponding idaho pca rates 
the decrease in pca rates were partially offset by an increase in base retail rates of million for the year 
the million decline in revenue from commercial customers in relative to  notwithstanding an increase in usage  is largely due to the disproportionate impact of the pca rate reductions that went into effect in and commercial customer rates are typically subject to a greater adjustment when pca rates increase or decrease 
customers 
changes related to a special industrial customer contract  along with small increments in customer count  increased general business revenues by million 
customer growth from to was percent 
usage 
for  higher usage increased general business revenue million compared to the increase was due primarily to colder first quarter temperatures  which increased power demand for residential heating purposes  as well as a percent increase in cooling degree days during the year  which increased power demand for air conditioning purposes 
this increase was partially offset by a percent decrease in irrigation usage resulting from the cooler spring weather and the timing and level of precipitation during the second quarter of general business revenues compared to rates 
rate increases positively impacted general business revenue by million in as compared to  due to increases in base rates of million  partially offset by pca rate decreases of million 
customers 
growth in customer count contributed to a modest increase in general business revenues of million 
customer growth from to was percent 
usage 
a decrease in usage reduced general business revenue by million 
idaho power believes the decline in total mwh sales was due primarily to mild temperatures  which decreased power demand for heating and cooling purposes  and partially due to the continued weakness of the economy and energy conservation practices in its service area 
off system sales off system sales consist primarily of long term sales contracts and opportunity sales of surplus system energy 
the table below presents idaho power s off system sales for the last three years 
year ended december  revenue mwh sold revenue per mwh off system sales compared to off system sales revenue increased by million  or percent  in as compared to sales volumes nearly doubled  as increases in output from hydroelectric and purpa resources increased surplus power available for sale 
this increase was partially offset by a percent decrease in average prices due in part to abundant hydroelectric generation in the region 
off system sales compared to off system sales revenue decreased million in as compared to hydroelectric generation decreased nine percent  which reduced surplus power available for sale 
this decrease was partially offset by an percent increase in revenue per mwh due to lower hydro generation in the region which drove wholesale power prices higher 
other revenues the table below presents the components of other revenues for the last three years 
year ended december  transmission services  facility rental and other energy efficiency total other revenues compared to other revenues increased million in as compared to  due mainly to an increase of million in transmission system revenues  resulting principally from increases in wheeling services attributable to increases in ferc transmission rates that took effect on october  and  and from other facility rental increases  and a decrease in energy efficiency revenues of million  due in part to an ipuc order that moved custom efficiency payments to a regulatory asset that will be amortized over time and recovered through general rate cases rather than through the energy efficiency rider 
the remaining decrease relates to lower customer incentives paid versus the prior year 
energy efficiency activities are funded through a rider mechanism on customer bills 
energy efficiency program expenditures are reported as an operating expense with an equal amount of revenues recorded in other revenues  resulting in no net impact on earnings 
the cumulative variance between expenditures and amounts collected through the rider is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability pending future collection from or obligation to customers 
a liability balance indicates that idaho power has collected more than it has spent and an asset balance indicates that idaho power has spent more than it has collected 
as of december   idaho power s energy efficiency rider balance was a regulatory asset of million 
other revenues compared to other revenues increased million in as compared to  due mainly to an increase of million in transmission system revenues 
transmission system revenues increased million primarily due to new transmission facilities  as well as rate changes 
wheeling revenue increased million primarily due to increases in the ferc formula rate that took effect on october  and october   and an increase in energy efficiency revenues of million  due to increased program activity 
energy efficiency activities are funded through rider mechanisms on customer bills 
purchased power the table below presents idaho power s purchased power expenses and volumes for the last three years 
year ended december  expense purpa contracts other purchased power including wheeling total purchased power expense mwh purchased purpa contracts other purchased power total mwh purchased cost per mwh from purpa contracts cost per mwh from other sources weighted average all sources the purchased power cost per mwh often exceeds the off system sales revenue per mwh because idaho power generally needs to purchase power during heavy load periods  which is higher priced energy  than during light load periods  which is lower priced energy  and conversely has less energy available for off system sales during heavy load periods than light load periods 
also  in accordance with idaho power s risk management policy  idaho power may purchase or sell energy several months in advance of anticipated delivery 
the regional energy market price is dynamic and additional energy purchase or sale transactions that idaho power makes at current market prices may be noticeably different than the advance purchase or sale transactions prices 
purchased power compared to purchased power expense increased million  or percent  in as compared to this increase was driven by mwh purchased from purpa contracts  which increased percent due to new purpa wind generation facilities coming on line 
the increase was partially offset by reduced wholesale market purchases resulted from idaho power s above average hydroelectric generation in  and continued reliance on financial hedges to mitigate potential changes in forecasted hydrologic conditions 
wholesale market purchases were also down due to lower system loads resulting from relatively mild weather 
purchased power compared to purchased power expense decreased million in as compared to  due to lower system loads that resulted from mild weather  relatively weak economic conditions  energy conservation practices  and a greater reliance on financial hedges to mitigate potential changes in forecasted hydrologic conditions 
fuel expense idaho power s fuel expenses and generation at its thermal generating plants for the last three years are included in the table below 
year ended december  expense coal natural gas and other total fuel expense mwh generated coal natural gas and other total mwh generated cost per mwh coal natural gas and other weighted average  all sources most fuel supply contracts are subject to changes in published indexes that are closely related to materials and supplies  labor  and diesel costs 
in addition to commodity variable costs  both natural gas and coal expense include costs that are more fixed in nature for items such as capacity charges  transportation  and fuel handling 
period to period variances in fuel expense per mwh are noticeably impacted by these fixed charges when generation output is substantially different between the two periods 
fuel expense compared to in  fuel expense decreased million  or percent  compared to  due to lower generation at idaho power s thermal plants 
the output at these plants was down million mwh  or percent in compared to the reduced dispatch was primarily caused by lower regional power prices due to higher regional hydroelectric and wind generation 
the impact of lower thermal generation was partially offset by higher coal prices 
during parts of  the bridger and valmy generating plants received fuel from prior lower cost contracts 
fuel expense compared to in  fuel expense increased million compared to due to new higher priced contracts with black butte coal company for supplying the valmy and jim bridger plants that took effect in early bcc  which also supplies coal to the jim bridger plant  experienced higher labor related costs due to a tight labor market in the southwest wyoming area and higher materials and supplies expense related to the underground mining operation 
fuel expense also increased due to a percent increase in generation at the boardman plant due to an extended outage in that did not recur in  increasing fuel expense million 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in fuel expense at the natural gas fired peaking plants 
pca mechanisms idaho power s power supply costs can vary significantly from year to year  primarily because of the impacts of weather  system loads  and commodity markets 
to address the volatility of power supply costs  idaho power has pca mechanisms for both the idaho and oregon jurisdictions 
these mechanisms allow idaho power to recover from or refund to customers most of the fluctuations in power supply costs 
because of these mechanisms  the primary financial impacts of power supply cost variations is that cash is paid out but recovery from customers does not occur until a future period  or cash that is collected is refunded to customers  resulting in fluctuations in operating cash flows from year to year 
pca expense represents the effects of the idaho and oregon pca mechanisms 
the table below presents the components of the idaho and oregon pca mechanisms for the last three years 
year ended december  idaho power supply cost accrual deferral oregon power supply cost accrual oregon excess power cost order amortization of prior year authorized balances total power cost adjustment expense the power supply accruals or deferrals represent the portion of that periods power supply cost fluctuations accrued or deferred under the pca mechanisms 
if actual power supply costs are greater than the amount forecasted in pca rates  most of the excess is deferred 
accruals represent additional costs recorded because actual power supply costs were less than the amount forecasted in pca rates  as was the case for both jurisdictions in the amortization of the prior year s balances represents the amounts being collected refunded in the current pca year that were deferred or accrued in the prior pca year the true up component of the pca 
pca mechanisms compared to actual net power supply costs decreased in relative to while base net power supply costs increased  resulting in a change of million from a deferral of million to an accrual of million 
for  collections on deferred amounts have decreased due to lower pca true up rates  reducing the pca amortization by million 
pca mechanisms compared to a combination of changes in base power supply costs  elements of the pca mechanism  and a decrease in pca rates reduced pca expenses million in as compared to the million decrease in the amortization of the prior year s deferral balance resulted from lower pca true up rates in effect in the million decrease in the idaho deferral is due to changes in base and actual power supply costs and forecast rates 
in addition  in idaho power recorded the effect of an order from the opuc that allows idaho power to defer for future recovery million of costs incurred in prior years 
other operations and maintenance expenses the million increase in other o m expense in as compared to was principally due to million of increased pension expenses relating to the settlement stipulation that reduced a portion of idaho customers future obligation through a reduction in the pension regulatory asset  increased pension and other benefit expenses of million  primarily due to pension expense amortization that began in june and was increased in june in conjunction with recovery of deferred pension costs in rates  million in higher thermal o m due to maintenance outages at the valmy plant  partially offset by an equipment impairment taken in at the bridger plant that did not recur in  and an increase in other payroll related costs of million 
these increases were partially offset by a combination of lower meter reading expense and the completed amortization of certain dsm expenses of million  and lower outside service fees of million 
other o m expense increased million from to  an increase of less than one percent 
income taxes income tax expense idacorp s and idaho power s income tax expense for decreased significantly relative to  primarily as a result of an irs examination settlement in related to idaho power s uniform capitalization tax accounting method 
income tax expense in was down significantly from  principally as a result of idaho power s tax accounting method change for repair related expenditures and lower pre tax earnings at idacorp and idaho power 
for additional information relating to idacorp s and idaho power s income taxes  see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
status of audit proceedings and tax method changes in september  idaho power adopted a tax accounting method change for capitalized repair expenditures on utility assets concurrent with the filing of idacorp s consolidated federal income tax return 
also in  idaho power reached an agreement with the irs  subject to subsequent review by the joint committee  regarding the allocation of mixed service costs in its method of uniform capitalization 
both methods were subject to audit under idacorp s irs examination 
in april  idacorp and the irs reached an agreement on idaho power s tax accounting method change for capitalized repairs 
accordingly  the irs finalized the examination and submitted its report on the tax year to the joint committee for review 
idaho power considers the capitalized repairs method effectively settled and believes that no material income tax uncertainties remain for the method 
as such  idaho power recognized million of its previously unrecognized tax benefits for this method in the second quarter of in september  the irs notified idacorp that the joint committee had completed its review and approved the uniform capitalization method agreement 
idaho power considers the uniform capitalization method effectively settled and believes that no material income tax uncertainties remain for the method 
accordingly  idaho power recognized million of its previously unrecognized tax benefits for tax years and prior in the third quarter of completion of the joint committee review allowed the irs to finalize its examination  process the income tax changes  and close the case in september in the fourth quarter  idacorp and idaho power paid previously accrued income tax liabilities of million and million  respectively  related to the capitalized repairs examination agreement 
the difference in liabilities is primarily due to idacorp s utilization of deferred federal general business tax credits 
there were no cash impacts related to the uniform capitalization method settlement as income tax refunds for the method change were received in in early  idacorp requested and received the return of million of previously made estimated tax payments for the tax year 
in december  the irs completed its examination of idacorp s tax year 
there were no unresolved income tax issues as a result of the irs examination 
accordingly  the examination had no impact on idacorp or idaho power s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
bonus depreciation legislation the small business jobs act jobs act and the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of tax relief act includes provisions for the extension and increase of bonus depreciation 
bonus depreciation provides for the accelerated deduction of current capital expenditures from certain asset classes 
the jobs act extended percent bonus depreciation to and the tax relief act extended bonus depreciation to and increased it to percent for a portion of and idaho power has included an estimated bonus deprecation deduction in its current income tax provision 
the estimated deduction would reduce idaho power s federal income tax liability by approximately million 
the state of idaho did not conform to the federal bonus depreciation rules for liquidity and capital resources overview idacorp s and idaho power s operating cash flows are driven principally by idaho power s sales of electricity and transmission capacity 
general business revenues and the costs to supply power to general business customers  and the timing of income tax payments  are factors that have the greatest impact on idaho power s operating cash flows and are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to power generation conditions and idaho power s ability to obtain rate relief to cover its operating costs and provide a return on investment 
significant uses of cash flows from idaho power s utility operations include the purchase of electricity  the purchase of fuel for power generation  and payment of other operating expenses  taxes  and interest  with any excess amount being available for other uses such as capital expenditures and the payment of dividends 
idaho power is in a period of significant infrastructure investment  adding capacity to its baseload generation  transmission system  and distribution facilities in an effort to ensure an adequate supply of electricity  to provide service to new customers  and to maintain system reliability 
idaho power s aging hydroelectric and thermal generation facilities require continuing upgrades and component replacement  and the costs related to relicensing hydroelectric facilities and complying with the new licenses are substantial 
idaho power expects that total capital expenditures will be between million and million over the period from through idaho power s operating cash flows usually do not fully support the amount required for utility capital expenditures during periods of significant infrastructure development 
idaho power uses operating and capital budgets to control operating costs and optimize capital expenditures  and funds its liquidity needs for capital expenditures through cash flows from operations  debt offerings  commercial paper markets  credit facilities  and capital contributions from idacorp 
idaho power seeks to recover its operating costs and earn a return on its capital expenditures through rates  periodically filing for rate adjustments for recovery of operating costs and capital investments to provide the opportunity to align idaho power s earned returns with those allowed by regulators 
idacorp and idaho power expect to continue financing capital requirements with a combination of internally generated funds and externally financed capital  and expect minimal need for external financing in however  idacorp and idaho power monitor debt market conditions and may issue debt securities when they determine that  under the circumstances and in light of the timing and extent of financing needs  conditions are favorable for issuance of debt securities 
idaho power has million in principal amount of medium term notes due in november and expects to fund retirement of those notes with cash from operations or some combination of cash from operations and the issuance of debt securities 
idacorp plans to continue to issue common stock under the pre existing dividend reinvestment and employee related stock purchase plans in while not expected in  idacorp may also determine to issue idacorp common stock from time to time under its continuous equity program  depending on market conditions and capital needs 
idacorp and idaho power seek to maintain capital structures of approximately percent debt and percent equity  and maintaining this ratio influences idacorp s and idaho power s debt and equity issuance decisions 
as of december   idacorp s capital structure consisted of approximately percent equity and percent debt  which decreases the likelihood that idacorp will issue equity securities during a significant focus for will be to control costs and generate sufficient cash from operations to meet operating needs and contribute to capital expenditure requirements 
on october   idacorp and idaho power entered into agreements that amended and restated their respective credit agreements 
idacorp s new credit facility consists of a revolving line of credit not to exceed the aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding of million  including swingline loans in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed million and letters of credit in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed million 
idaho power s new credit facility consists of a revolving line of credit  through issuance of loans and standby letters of credit  not to exceed the aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding of million  including swingline loans in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed million 
idacorp and idaho power each have the right to request an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the new credit facilities to million and million  respectively  in each case subject to certain conditions 
as of february   idacorp s and idaho power s access to debt  equity  and credit arrangements included their respective million and million revolving credit facilities  idacorp s shelf registration statement  which can be used for the issuance of debt securities and common stock  including up to million shares of idacorp common stock available for issuance under its continuous equity program 
approximately million of debt and equity securities issuances remained available under the shelf registration statement  idaho power s shelf registration statement  which can be used for the issuance of first mortgage bonds and debt securities 
million remained available under the shelf registration statement  and idacorp s and idaho power s issuance of commercial paper  which can be used to meet short term liquidity requirements 
the conditions of the capital markets and the weak economy have in recent years caused a general concern regarding access to sufficient capital at a reasonable cost 
notwithstanding these concerns  idacorp and idaho power have not been significantly affected by this disruption in the credit environment  including in the commercial paper markets  and currently expect to continue to be able to access the capital markets to meet anticipated short and long term borrowing needs

credit facilities as described above  on october   idacorp and idaho power executed new credit agreements that amended and restated their existing million and million credit facilities  respectively 
each of the new credit facilities mature on october   and may be used for general corporate purposes and commercial paper back up 
idacorp s facility permits borrowings under a revolving line of credit of up to million at any one time outstanding  including swingline loans not to exceed million at any time and letters of credit not to exceed million at any time 
idacorp s facility may be increased  subject to specified conditions  to million

idaho power s facility may be increased  subject to specified conditions  to million 
each company may request up to two one year extensions of the then existing maturity date 
the interest rates for any borrowings under the facilities are based on either a floating rate that is equal to the highest of the prime rate  federal funds rate plus percent  or libor rate plus percent  or the libor rate  plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is based on idacorp s or idaho power s  as applicable  senior unsecured long term indebtedness credit rating by moody s investors service  inc  standard and poor s ratings services  and fitch rating services  inc  as set forth on a schedule to the credit agreements 
the companies also pay a facility fee based on the respective company s credit rating for senior unsecured long term debt securities 
each facility contains a covenant requiring each company to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization equal to or less than as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
in determining the leverage ratio  consolidated indebtedness broadly includes all indebtedness of the respective borrower and its subsidiaries  including  in some instances  indebtedness evidenced by certain hybrid securities as defined in the credit agreement 
consolidated total capitalization is calculated as the sum of all consolidated indebtedness  consolidated stockholders equity of the borrower and its subsidiaries  and the aggregate value of outstanding hybrid securities 
at december   the leverage ratios for idacorp and idaho power were percent and percent  respectively 
idacorp s and idaho power s ability to utilize the credit facilities is conditioned upon their continued compliance with the leverage ratio covenants included in the credit facilities  which could limit the ability of the companies to issue first mortgage bonds and debt securities 
there are additional covenants  subject to exceptions  that prohibit certain mergers  acquisitions  and investments  restrict the creation of certain liens  and prohibit entering into any agreements restricting dividend payments from any material subsidiary

upon any other event of default  the lenders holding greater than percent of the outstanding loans or greater than percent of the aggregate commitments required lenders or the administrative agent with the consent of the required lenders may terminate or suspend the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the facility and to issue letters of credit under the facility and or declare the obligations to be due and payable 
during an event of default under the facilities  the lenders may  at their option  increase the applicable interest rates then in effect and the letter of credit fee by percent per annum 
a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in the cost of borrowing  but would not result in a default or acceleration of the debt under the facilities 
however  if idaho power s ratings are downgraded below investment grade  idaho power must extend or renew its authority for borrowings under its ipuc and opuc regulatory orders 
without additional approval from the ipuc  the opuc  and the public service commission of wyoming  the aggregate amount of short term borrowings by idaho power at any one time outstanding may not exceed million

the discussion below highlights certain notable regulatory determinations and pending matters or issues that may have a material impact on idacorp s and idaho power s business or results 
regulatory matters  and in many cases their financial impact on idacorp and idaho power  are also discussed in note regulatory matters to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  which should be read in conjunction with the discussion below 
idaho and oregon significant rate changes as a regulated utility  the prices that the ipuc and opuc authorize idaho power to charge for its retail services is a major factor in determining idacorp s and idaho power s results of operations and financial condition 
the table below summarizes notable rate increases and decreases  shown on an annualized basis  in recent years 
certain of the regulatory actions that resulted in the rate increases and decreases are described in more detail in this section of md a or in note regulatory matters to the consolidated financial statements included in this report

idaho general rate case settlement on june   idaho power filed a general rate case and proposed rate schedules with the ipuc  case no 
ipc e in its general rate case application  idaho power requested an additional million in annual revenues in idaho jurisdictional base rates  comprised of approximately million related to revenue requirement categories other than net power supply expenses non npse and million associated with net power supply expenses npse 
on september   idaho power  the ipuc staff  and other interested parties publicly filed a settlement stipulation with the ipuc resolving most of the key contested issues in the idaho general rate case 
the settlement stipulation provided for a reduction of approximately million to the requested non npse recovery  resulting in a million increase in the non npse components of idaho jurisdictional base rates 
the settlement stipulation also provided that approximately million of idaho jurisdictional revenue associated with the recovery of npse associated with purpa power costs would not be included in base rates  but would instead be eligible for percent recovery through the idaho pca mechanism if the costs are incurred 
idaho power s requested idaho jurisdictional base rate increase and the adjustments reflected in the settlement stipulation are summarized in the table below in millions 
non npse npse total as filed in general rate case adjustments in settlement stipulation total settlement stipulation the settlement stipulation provided for a percent authorized rate of return on an idaho jurisdictional rate base of approximately billion 
on december   the ipuc issued an order approving the settlement stipulation  with new rates effective january  neither the order nor the settlement stipulation specified an authorized rate of return on equity 
additional details relating to the idaho general rate case and settlement are included in note regulatory matters to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
december idaho settlement agreement on january   the ipuc approved a settlement agreement among idaho power  several of idaho power s customers  the ipuc staff  and others  in connection with a general rate case 
significant elements of the january settlement agreement included  among other items a provision to share with idaho customers percent of any idaho jurisdiction earnings in excess of a percent idaho roe in any calendar year from to  and a provision to allow the additional amortization of accumulated deferred investment tax credits aditc if idaho power s idaho roe is below percent in any calendar year from to in its idaho jurisdiction 
idaho power was permitted to amortize additional aditc in an amount up to million over the three year period  with specified annual limits 
because idaho power s idaho roe was between and percent in and  the sharing and accelerated amortization provisions of the january settlement agreement were not triggered 
however  recognition of income tax benefits in had a significant impact on idaho power s idaho roe and contributed to the triggering of the sharing mechanism 
in accordance with the january settlement agreement  idaho power recorded a million regulatory liability in  reflecting percent of idaho power s idaho jurisdictional earnings above a percent idaho roe required to be shared with idaho customers 
the sharing and amortization provisions of the january settlement agreement terminated on december  on december   the ipuc issued an order approving a settlement stipulation that had been executed by idaho power  the ipuc staff  and one large industrial customer of idaho power and filed with the ipuc on december  the settlement stipulation provides that if idaho power s idaho roe for   or is less than percent  then idaho power may amortize additional aditc to help achieve a minimum percent idaho roe in the applicable year 
idaho power would be permitted to amortize additional aditc in an aggregate amount up to million over the three year period  but could use no more that million in  if idaho power s idaho roe for   or exceeds percent  the amount of idaho power s idaho jurisdictional earnings exceeding a percent but less than a percent idaho roe for the applicable year would be shared equally between idaho power and its idaho customers  and if idaho power s idaho roe for   or exceeds percent  the amount of idaho power s idaho jurisdictional earnings exceeding a percent idaho roe for the applicable year would be allocated percent to idaho power s idaho customers and percent to idaho power 
in consideration of these terms  the settlement stipulation provided that idaho power will allocate to customers percent of idaho power s share of idaho jurisdictional earnings over a percent idaho roe 
as a result  idaho power recorded a pre tax charge to pension expense of approximately million in  representing the additional amount to be allocated to idaho customers 
after the combined effect of the percent sharing mechanism in the january settlement agreement and the december settlement order that provided for additional sharing  idaho power retained percent of idaho jurisdiction earnings exceeding a percent idaho roe 
opuc deferral request on november   the opuc staff filed an application seeking authorization from the opuc to defer in the oregon jurisdiction million of the benefit resulting from the uniform capitalization tax method change 
idaho power is opposing the application  and hearings and briefs are scheduled for mid idaho defined benefit pension plan contribution recovery in september  idaho power made a million contribution to its defined benefit pension plan 
to provide for timely recovery in rates of that contribution  on march   idaho power filed an application with the ipuc requesting an increase in the amount included in base rates for recovery of the idaho allocated portion of idaho power s cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plan from the then current amount of million to approximately million annually 
on may   the ipuc approved idaho power s application  with new rates effective june  idaho power also expects to continue to make additional significant cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plan through at least for estimated defined benefit pension plan funding obligations  refer to note benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and critical accounting policies and estimates pension and other postretirement benefits in this md a 
the order issued by the ipuc pertaining to the december idaho settlement agreement described above provided that idaho power s allocation to customers of percent of idaho power s share of idaho roe over percent would be in the form of a million reduction to idaho power s pension regulatory asset to reduce the future customer obligation 
langley gulch power plant ratemaking on september   idaho power received pre approval from the ipuc to include million of construction costs in idaho power s rate base when the langley gulch power plant achieves commercial operation 
idaho power may request recovery of additional costs if they exceed million  provided that the additional costs were reasonably and prudently incurred 
based on the current project status  idaho power estimates that the plant will be in service by july  idaho power plans to time the filing of its applications with the ipuc and opuc for recovery of construction costs such that regulatory authority for collection of those costs is issued  and customer rates adjusted  as near as practicable to the project s commercial in service date 
oregon general rate case on july   idaho power filed a general rate case and proposed rate schedules with the opuc  case no 
ue the filing requested a million increase in annual oregon jurisdictional revenues 
the filing requested an authorized rate of return on equity of percent with an oregon retail rate base of approximately million  and a rate of return on capital of percent 
idaho power  the opuc staff  and other interested parties executed and filed a partial settlement stipulation with the opuc on february   which resolves all matters in the general rate case other than the prudence of costs associated with pollution control investments at the jim bridger coal plant 
the settlement stipulation provides for a return on equity of percent and an overall rate of return of percent 
if the stipulation is approved by the opuc  idaho power expects that new rates will become effective on march  as of the date of this report  idaho power is unable to determine the outcome of the proceeding 
integrated resource plan as a public utility under the jurisdiction of the ferc  the ipuc  and the opuc  idaho power is obligated to plan for and expand its transmission system to provide requested firm transmission service to third parties  to construct and place in service sufficient generation and transmission capacity to reliably deliver resources to network customers and the company s retail customers  and otherwise take actions to fulfill its obligation to provide safe and reliable electric service 
as part of its resource planning  and in accordance with regulatory requirements  idaho power prepares and publishes an irp every two years 
the irp addresses available supply side and demand side resource options  planning period load forecasts  potential resource portfolios  a risk analysis  and near term and long term action plans 
idaho power filed its irp with the ipuc and opuc on june  in developing its irp  idaho power forecast the number of customers in idaho power s service area will increase approximately percent per year  from approximately  at the end of to over  by the end of the irp s year planning period in the irp expected case load forecast projects peak hour load will grow mw annually and average system load will increase annually average mw amw over the year planning period  with an expected case  average annual system load of  amw by idaho power intends to meet the anticipated increase in demand through energy efficiency and demand response programs  the development of transmission capacity and additional generation resources  such as its mw langley gulch natural gas fired power plant currently under construction  and from the purchase of power from third parties  including from renewable energy projects and market power purchases 
idaho power stated in the irp that it expects energy efficiency programs to result in amw of load reduction by  and that demand response programs are targeted to reduce peak summer load by mw by summer the irp also identifies transmission constraints as a significant issue for idaho power 
idaho power is in the process of developing the boardman to hemingway transmission project in an effort to alleviate in part its transmission capacity constraint from the pacific northwest 
on december   the ipuc issued an order accepting idaho power s irp 
the order directed idaho power to continue to address a number of items  including a comparing the risk  cost  and environmental benefits of strategies that directly reduce emissions from its resource mix to the purchase of emission offsets or offset options  b redoubling its efforts to realize the achievable potential for savings from efficiency and dsm programs  and c addressing the risks of reliance on natural gas in its resource portfolio 
the order also directs idaho power to provide as part of its irp additional information and or analyses related to the gateway west transmission project involvement  idaho power s proposed solar demonstration project  hcc relicensing efforts  early retirement of existing coal plants  and the quantification of transmission siting and market price risks 
purpa power purchase contracts pursuant to the requirements of section of purpa  the ipuc and opuc have each issued orders and rules regulating idaho power s purchase of power from cogeneration and small power production facilities 
a key component of the purpa power purchase contracts is the energy price contained within the agreements 
regulatory mandated execution of purpa agreements may result in idaho power acquiring energy it does not need at above wholesale market prices and require additional operational integration measures  thus increasing costs to idaho power s customers 
substantially all purpa power purchase costs are recovered through base rates and idaho power s power supply cost mechanisms  and thus the primary impact of the purpa agreements is on customer rates 
idaho proceedings in response to a november  application filed by idaho power and two other electric utilities with idaho service territories  on february   the ipuc issued an order temporarily reducing the eligibility cap for purpa projects entitled to published avoided cost rates from amw to kw for wind and solar purpa projects while the ipuc further investigated the implications of large projects disaggregating into smaller projects to qualify for higher published avoided cost rates and other benefits 
on june   the ipuc issued an order maintaining the kw eligibility cap for published avoided cost rates for wind and solar purpa projects  and initiating additional proceedings to allow the parties to investigate and analyze the methodologies used in determining the appropriate power purchase price for purpa projects 
on that same date  the ipuc issued orders disapproving wind power purchase agreements 
idaho power estimates that the payments over the lives of the disapproved agreements would have totaled approximately billion 
idaho power remains engaged in proceedings at the ipuc relating to the determination of appropriate power purchase prices and other terms of purpa power purchase agreements 
the ipuc has established a timeline for various informational filings by all parties to the case  with hearings scheduled for august on january   idaho power submitted written testimony in the purpa proceedings  in support of idaho power s request that the ipuc a change the methodology used to establish power purchase prices for purpa projects  b reduce the maximum authorized purpa power purchase agreement term from the existing years to a maximum of five years  and c authorize a curtailment strategy that would allow idaho power to optimize use of its cost effective resources 
oregon proceedings in response to two filings idaho power made with the opuc in january  on february  the opuc issued an order effectively imposing a day prohibition on idaho power s entering into standard contracts with qualified purpa facilities  allowing idaho power time to update its avoided cost rate through the irp process prior to executing standard purpa contracts 
in the same order  the opuc declined to reduce the eligibility cap for standard contracts from its current level of mw to kw 
idaho power expects to be engaged in proceedings at the opuc to resolve the same or similar issues being presented in the ipuc purpa matters 
bonneville power administration residential exchange program the pacific northwest electric power planning and conservation act of  through the residential exchange program rep  provides for access to the benefits of low cost federal hydroelectric power to residential and small farm customers of the region s investor owned utilities ious 
the program is administered by the bpa 
pursuant to agreements between the bpa and idaho power  benefits from the rep were passed through to idaho power s idaho and oregon residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits 
however  on may   the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit ruled that the settlement agreements entered into between the bpa and the ious including idaho power were inconsistent with the northwest power act 
as a result  on may   the bpa notified idaho power and six other ious that it was immediately suspending the rep payments 
subsequently  idaho power worked with other northwest ious and consumer owned utilities  pacific northwest public utility commissions  and the bpa to craft an agreement so that residential and small farm customers of idaho power can resume sharing in the benefits of the federal columbia river power system 
the bpa approved an rep settlement agreement in a record of decision dated july  and committed the bpa to perform its obligations under the settlement agreement in accordance with its terms 
updated rates became effective january  since any benefits will pass directly through to idaho power s eligible residential and small farm customers  the settlement is not expected to have a material effect on idaho power s financial condition or results of operations 
ferc compliance programs the ferc has approved an extensive number of reliability standards developed by the north american electric reliability corporation and the wecc  including critical infrastructure protection cip standards and regional standard variations 
as part of its compliance program  idaho power periodically reviews its operations for compliance with ferc rules  orders  and standards and self reports compliance issues to the ferc and the wecc 
recent reports idaho power has submitted to the ferc have generally focused on standards of conduct and idaho power s ferc oatt 
consistent with prior years  during the year ended december   idaho power self reported to the ferc and received notices of alleged violations from the ferc and the wecc 
idaho power has also received notification that the ferc intends to take no further action regarding several issues previously reported by idaho power 
consistent with its historical practice  idaho power is working with the ferc and the wecc to resolve alleged violations and items it self reported to the ferc and the wecc 
idaho power is unable to predict what action  if any  the wecc or the ferc will take on those unresolved matters  but based on the nature of the potential violations idaho power does not expect any material adverse effect from currently alleged violations on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
idaho power plans to continue its efforts to reduce potential violations through its compliance program and its approach of self reporting compliance issues to  and working with  the ferc and the wecc 
relicensing of hydroelectric projects idaho power  like other utilities that operate nonfederal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways  obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the ferc 
these licenses last for to years depending on the size  complexity  and cost of the project 
idaho power is actively pursuing the relicensing of the hcc and the swan falls project sfp 
in addition  in july idaho power received a license amendment to expand the shoshone falls hydroelectric project and to potentially extend the term of the license beyond its expiration date 
hells canyon complex the most significant ongoing relicensing effort is the hcc  which provides approximately percent of idaho power s hydroelectric generating nameplate capacity and percent of its total generating nameplate capacity 
in july  idaho power filed an application for a new license in anticipation of the july expiration of the then existing license 
in connection with the relicensing process  in august the ferc staff issued a final eis for the hcc  which the ferc will use to determine whether  and under what conditions  to issue a new license for the project 
the purpose of the final eis is to inform the ferc  federal and state agencies  native american tribes  and the public about the environmental effects of idaho power s operation of the hcc 
certain portions of the final eis involve issues that may be influenced by water quality certifications for the project under section of the clean water act cwa and formal consultations under the endangered species act esa  which remain unresolved 
because the hcc is located on the snake river where it forms the border between idaho and oregon  idaho power has filed water quality certification applications  required under section of the cwa  with the states of idaho and oregon requesting that each state certify that any discharges from the project comply with applicable state water quality standards 
water quality issues are of interest to various federal and state agencies  native american tribes  and other parties who may provide input to the states certification process 
section of the cwa requires that a state either approve or deny a water quality certification application within one year of the filing of the application or the state may be considered to have waived its certification authority under the cwa 
as a consequence  idaho power has been filing and withdrawing its section certification applications with oregon and idaho on an annual basis while it has been working with the states to identify measures that will provide reasonable assurance that discharges from the hcc will adequately address applicable water quality standards 
on september   in connection with the issuance of its final eis  the ferc notified the nmfs and the usfws of its determination that the licensing of the hcc was likely to adversely affect esa listed species under the nmfs s and usfws s jurisdiction and requested that the nmfs and usfws initiate formal consultation under section of the esa on the licensing of the hcc 
each of the nmfs and usfws responded to the ferc that the conditions relating to the licensing of the hcc were not fully described or developed in the final eis as the measures to address the water quality effects of the project were yet to be fully defined by the section certification process pending before the oregon and idaho departments of environmental quality 
the nmfs and usfws therefore recommended that formal consultation under the esa be delayed until the section certification process is completed 
idaho power continues to work with idaho and oregon in the development of measures to provide reasonable assurance that any discharges from the hcc will comply with applicable state water quality standards so that appropriate water quality certifications can be issued for the project  and continues to cooperate with the usfws  nmfs  and the ferc in an effort to address esa concerns 
idaho power expects the ferc to issue a license order for the hcc once the esa consultation and the state water quality certification processes are completed 
idaho power is currently operating under an annual license issued by the ferc and expects to continue operating under annual licenses until a new multi year license is issued 
swan falls project the existing license for the sfp expired in june idaho power is currently operating the sfp under an annual license while its application for a multi year license is pending before the ferc 
in august  the ferc issued a final eis in connection with the relicensing of the sfp 
the snake river physa snail  a species listed as endangered under the esa  was found in the area during the eis review 
in february  the usfws issued a biological opinion to address the project s effects on the snake river physa snail 
the biological opinion includes a provision for the incidental take of the snail for purposes of licensing and continued operation of the project 
idaho power is required to study the status of the snake river physa snail and its habitat within and downstream of the project area for the term of the new license  which idaho power anticipates will be between and years 
idaho power expects the ferc to issue a license for the sfp in the second quarter of treatment of relicensing costs relicensing costs are recorded in construction work in progress until new multi year licenses are issued by the ferc  at which time the charges are transferred to electric plant in service 
relicensing costs and costs related to new licenses will be submitted to regulators for recovery through the ratemaking process 
relicensing costs of million and million for hcc and sfp  respectively  were included in construction work in progress at december  as of the date of this report  the ipuc authorizes idaho power to include in its idaho jurisdictional rates approximately million annually million grossed up for income taxes of afudc relating to the hcc relicensing project  and collecting these amounts will reduce the relicensing amount submitted to regulators for recovery through the ratemaking process 
through december   idaho power has collected million of afudc related to the hcc relicensing project through customer rates 
shoshone falls expansion on july   the ferc amended the license for the shoshone falls project to expand its generating capacity to approximately mw 
the amended license has an expiration date of  but provides that the license will be extended to following completion of the proposed generation capacity expansion project 
idaho power filed a request for a two year schedule extension with the ferc in january as it continues to evaluate the project and the associated license requirements  costs  and operating issues  which if granted would change idaho power s estimated in service date for the upgrades if ultimately undertaken from to environmental matters overview idaho power is subject to regulations by federal  state  and local authorities governing the protection of the environment  including at the federal level the caa  the cwa  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  the emergency planning and community right to know act  the esa  the federal land policy and management act  the national environmental policy act  and the resource conservation and recovery act 
these laws and regulations are continuously changing and are generally becoming more restrictive 
idaho power monitors legislative and regulatory developments at all levels of government for environmental issues  particularly those with the potential to alter the operation and productivity of power generating plants and other assets 
environmental laws and regulations may  among other things  increase the cost of operating power generation plants and constructing new facilities  require that idaho power install additional pollution control devices at existing generating plants  or require that idaho power discontinue operating certain power generation plants 
while there can be no assurance of recovery  idaho power intends to seek recovery of any such costs through the ratemaking process 
idaho power co owns three coal fired power plants and owns two natural gas combustion turbine power plants that are subject to air quality regulation 
additionally  idaho power is in the process of construction and start up of the langley gulch power plant  a natural gas fired generating plant 
the caa establishes controls on the emissions from stationary sources like those owned by idaho power 
the epa adopts many of the standards and regulations under the caa  while states have the primary responsibility for implementation and administration of these air quality programs 
also  the ferc licenses issued for idaho power s hydroelectric generating plants impose numerous environmental requirements  such as aeration of water discharged through turbines to meet dissolved gas and temperature standards in the tail waters downstream from the plants 
idaho power monitors these issues and reports the results to the appropriate regulatory agencies 
idaho power continues to actively monitor  evaluate  and work on water quality and air quality issues 
these items are discussed in greater detail below 
idaho power continues to actively monitor pollution control standards as they are promulgated and their associated costs to idaho power as they relate to the economic and operational feasibility of generation plants 
in its order acknowledging idaho power s irp  the opuc directed idaho power to analyze a any potential epa  state  and other federal agency regulations associated with air quality  fly ash  and water that may affect idaho power s generation facilities  and b coal curtailment and the costs associated with coal plant retirement  and include the results of this analysis in its irp 
idaho power filed its irp in june with the ipuc and opuc  and the irp contains the analysis requested by opuc 
while not currently quantifiable  idaho power anticipates that a number of impending epa rulemakings addressing  among other things  ozone and fine particulate matter pollution  emissions  and disposal of coal combustion residuals could result in substantially increased operating and compliance costs 
in addition to the items below  also refer to note contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding certain environmental proceedings affecting idaho power s properties and item business environmental regulation and costs in this report 
global climate change and ghg emission intensity reduction goal there is concern nationally and internationally about climate change and the possible contribution of greenhouse gas ghg emissions to climate change 
long term climate change could significantly affect idaho power s business in a variety of ways  including changes in temperature and precipitation could affect customer demand  extreme weather events could increase service interruptions  outages  maintenance costs  and the need for additional backup systems  and can affect the supply of  and demand for  electricity and natural gas  which may impact the price of energy commodities  changes in the amount and timing of snowpack and stream flows could adversely affect hydroelectric generation  legislative and or regulatory developments related to climate change could affect plans and operations  including restrictions on the construction of new generation resources  the expansion of existing resources  or the operation of generation resources in general  and consumer preference for  and resource planning decisions requiring  renewable or low ghg emitting sources of energy could impact usage of existing generation sources and require significant investment in new generation and transmission infrastructure 
idaho power does not currently operate in coastal areas and  while there may be secondary impacts  it is not directly exposed to the effects of potential sea level rises that some experts predict may result from global climate change 
despite the current absence of a national mandatory ghg reduction program  idaho power is engaged in voluntary ghg emission intensity reduction efforts 
in september  idacorp s and idaho power s boards of directors approved guidelines that established a goal to reduce the co emission intensity of idaho power s utility operations 
idaho power s goal is to reduce its resource portfolio s average co emission intensity for the through time period to a level of to percent below idaho power s co emission intensity of  lbs co mwh 
the guidelines are intended to reduce idaho power s average co emission intensity in a manner that minimizes the costs of those reductions to idaho power s customers 
in may and may  idaho power submitted information to the carbon disclosure project  an independent  not for profit organization that claims the largest database of corporate climate change information in the world 
idaho power s estimated co emission intensity lbs mwh from its generation facilities as submitted to the carbon disclosure project was    and  lbs mwh for    and respectively 
in  idaho power and ida west together ranked as the nd lowest emitter of co per mwh produced and the st lowest emitter of co by tons of emissions among the nation s largest electricity producers  according to a june collaborative report from ceres  the natural resources defense council  public service enterprise group  constellation energy  and entergy using publicly reported generation and emissions data 
according to the report  out of the companies named  idaho power and ida west together ranked as the th largest power producer based on fossil fuel  nuclear  and renewable energy facility total electricity generation 
environmental regulation regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in recent years  there have been a number of bills introduced in the us congress relating to ghg emissions  renewable energy  energy efficiency  carbon capture and sequestration  and other matters 
however  given the complexities of this form of legislation and other competing legislative priorities  the timing and elements of any future legislation addressing ghg emission reduction requirements are uncertain 
there are also state and regional initiatives including the western regional climate action initiative considering market based mechanisms to reduce ghg emissions 
further  in support of international efforts to reduce ghg emissions  in january the obama administration pledged to cut ghg emissions in the united states from levels by percent by and percent by however  any international treaty creating mandatory ghg emission reduction requirements in the united states would require congressional approval 
in june and december  the epa issued final rules regulating ghg emissions through its pre construction and operating permit programs under the caa 
these rules are referred to as the tailoring rule and ghg permitting rules 
the first phase of the rules took effect in january and required imposition of best available control technology bact for ghg emissions if a new major source or modification of an existing major source is projected to result in ghg emissions of at least  tons per year co equivalent 
in addition  existing major sources were required to include applicable requirements relating to ghgs in their operating permits when the permits are renewed or the major source is modified 
idaho power believes that its owned and co owned generation plants are in compliance with the new ghg emission regulations 
in august  the oregon legislature enacted legislation establishing goals for the reduction of ghg emissions  which sought to cease the growth of oregon ghg emissions by  and seek to a by  reduce ghg levels to percent below levels  and b by  reduce ghg levels to at least percent below levels 
the legislation also calls for state government developed policy recommendations in the future to assist in the monitoring and achievement of these goals 
idaho power will continue to monitor and evaluate proposed international  federal  state  and regional ghg legislation or initiatives as well as judicial decisions that could affect its generating facilities and operations 
some recent initiatives regarding ghg emissions contemplate market based compliance programs  such as cap and trade programs or emission offsets 
the regulation of ghg emissions under the caa could result in ghg emission limits on stationary sources that do not provide market based compliance options 
such a program could raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels  specifically coal  as an economical energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities because new technologies for reducing co emissions from coal  including carbon capture and storage  are still in the development stage and are not yet proven 
emission standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs  which may accelerate the retirement of older  less efficient coal fired units 
there are financial  regulatory  and logistical uncertainties related to ghg reductions and the implementation of renewable energy mandates 
the impact on idaho power of currently proposed legislation relating to ghg emissions would depend on a variety of factors  including the specific ghg emissions limits or renewable energy requirements  the timing of implementation of these limits or requirements  the level of emissions allowances allocated and the level that must be purchased  the purchase price of emissions allowances  the development and commercial availability of technologies for renewable energy and for the reduction of emissions  the degree to which offsets may be used for compliance  provisions for cost containment if any  the impact on coal and natural gas prices  and cost recovery through rates 
accordingly  idaho power cannot meaningfully predict the effect on its results of operations  financial position  or cash flows of any ghg emission  renewable energy mandate  or other global climate change requirements that may be adopted  although the costs to implement and comply with any such requirements could be substantial 
idaho power would seek to recover these costs and expenditures from customers as costs of doing business but is unable to predict whether it would be permitted to recover some or all of the increased costs and expenditures from customers through rates 
in its irp  idaho power did not include any new conventional coal resources in the resource portfolio due to the uncertainty regarding future ghg regulations 
idacorp and idaho power s boards of directors continue to review environmental issues on a regular basis and in connection with the review of the companies strategic plans 
the boards of directors are also periodically informed of any new material environmental issues  including updates on any proposed legislation 
renewable portfolio standards legislation has been introduced in the us congress that would require utilities to obtain a specified percentage of their electricity from renewable sources  commonly referred to as a renewable portfolio standard or rps 
however  as of the date of this report no federal rps is in effect 
idaho power will be required to comply with a percent rps in oregon beginning in  and idaho power expects to meet these requirements with the recs from the elkhorn valley wind project 
no rps requirement currently exists in idaho 
idaho power continues to monitor proposed federal rps legislation and the possibility of additional state rps legislation 
utility maximum achievable control technology mact in april  the us district court for the district of columbia approved a timetable that required the epa to finalize a standard to control mercury emissions from coal fired power plants by november in march  the epa released the proposed utility maximum achievable control technology rule utility mact rule to control emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants haps from coal and oil fired electric utility steam generating units egus under the federal caa 
in the same notice  the epa further proposed to revise the nsps for fossil fuel fired egus 
in december  the epa finalized the utility mact rule 
the final utility mact rule remains largely the same as the proposal 
the final regulation imposes maximum achievable control technology and nsps standards on all coal fired egus and replaces the former clean air mercury rule 
specifically  the final regulation sets numeric emission limitations on coal fired egus for total particulate matter a surrogate for non mercury haps  hydrogen chloride  and mercury 
in addition  the final regulation imposes a work practice standard for organic haps  including dioxins and furans 
the final regulation also sets work practice standards to reduce emissions during start up and shut down 
for the revised nsps  for egus commencing construction of a new source after publication of the regulation  the epa has established amended emission limitations for particulate matter  sulfur dioxide  and nitrogen oxides 
mercury continuous emission monitoring systems have been installed on all of the coal fired units at the jim bridger  boardman  and valmy generating plants 
however  idaho power is in the process of determining how these regulations will impact the bridger  boardman  and valmy generating plants and what additional controls  if any  will need to be installed in order to comply with the regulations 
based on its evaluation as of the date of this report  idaho power does not foresee any plant closures due to the utility mact rule and expects related compliance costs will not be substantial 
national ambient air quality standards naaqs in july  the epa adopted new naaqs for ozone hour ozone standard and fine particulate matter of less than micrometers in diameter pm standard 
in december  the epa revised the naaqs for pm this new standard is the subject of a legal challenge by a number of groups 
however  all of the counties in idaho  nevada  oregon  and wyoming where idaho power s power plants are currently located were designated as meeting attainment with the revised pm naaqs 
in january  the epa adopted a new naaqs for no at a level of parts per billion averaged over a hour period 
in addition  in june the epa adopted a new naaqs for so at a level of parts per billion averaged over a one hour period 
the various states and the epa have not yet completed the designation of areas as attaining or not attaining these new naaqs 
as a result  idaho power is unable to predict what impact the adoption and implementation of these standards may have on its operations 
regional haze best available retrofit technology rh bart in accordance with federal regional haze rules  coal fired utility boilers are subject to rh bart if they were built between and and affect any class i areas 
this includes all four units at the jim bridger plant and the boardman plant 
the two units at the valmy plant were constructed after and are not  as of the date of this report  subject to the federal regional haze rule 
the wyoming department of environmental quality wdeq and the oregon department of environmental quality odeq have conducted assessments of the jim bridger and boardman plants pursuant to an rh bart process 
these states have also evaluated the need for additional controls at jim bridger and boardman to achieve reasonable progress toward a long term strategy beyond rh bart to reduce regional haze in class i areas to natural conditions by the year jim bridger plant in december  the wdeq issued a rh bart permit to pacificorp for the jim bridger plant 
the wdeq determined that low nox burners with over fire air is rh bart for nox for all four bridger units and that rh bart is not required for so for the jim bridger plant 
as part of the wdeq s long term strategy for regional haze  the permit requires that pacificorp install selective catalytic reduction scr for nox control at jim bridger units and by december  and december   respectively  and submit an application by january  to install add on nox controls at jim bridger units and by december  pacificorp is already in the process of installing low nox burners and so scrubber upgrades at the jim bridger plant 
the so scrubber upgrade project has been completed on all four jim bridger units 
idaho power expects to spend approximately million in to complete these pollution control projects 
idaho power s estimated share of the cost to install scr on jim bridger units and is million 
installation of scr also could require extended maintenance outages 
design and cost estimates for add on nox controls at jim bridger units and are not yet available 
in february  pacificorp filed an administrative appeal of the jim bridger rh bart permit with the wyoming environmental quality council weqc 
pacificorp argued that the wdeq lacked the legal and technical basis to require the scr and add on nox controls required by the permit 
in november  pacificorp and the wdeq signed a settlement agreement under which pacificorp has agreed to install scr  alternative add on nox controls  or otherwise achieve a lb mmbtu day rolling average nox emission rate by december  for unit and december  for unit in addition  pacificorp has agreed to install scr  alternative add on nox controls  or otherwise achieve a lb mmbtu day rolling average nox emission rate by december  for unit and december  for unit the settlement agreement is conditioned on the epa ultimately approving those portions of the wyoming regional haze state implementation plan rh sip that are consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement 
in light of the settlement agreement  pacificorp received a revised rh bart permit for jim bridger on november  in september  a federal district court in colorado approved a consent decree in the case of wildearth guardians v 
jackson pursuant to which the epa must either propose to approve the wyoming rh sip or propose an alternate federal implementation plan fip by april  in addition  the epa must either grant final approval to the wyoming rh sip or finalize an rh fip for wyoming by october  boardman power plant following the introduction of various plans and an extensive public process  in december the oeqc approved a plan to cease coal fired operations at the boardman power plant not later than december  the rules implementing the plan were approved by the epa and published in the federal register in july  and require the installation of a number of emissions controls 
the new rules repeal the oeqc s best available retrofit technology rule  which would have allowed continued operation of the boardman plant through at least with installation of a more extensive suite of emissions controls 
the estimated combined total capital cost of the required controls under the plan approved by the oeqc is approximately million 
idaho power is a percent owner of the boardman plant  and thus idaho power s estimated share of the capital cost is million  which is in addition to normal capital expenditures and maintenance costs 
as of december   idaho power had paid million of its total estimated share of the capital cost 
in september  the federal district court in oregon approved a consent decree that settled a citizen suit brought by the sierra club against pge alleging certain violations of the requirements of the caa at the boardman plant 
under the terms of the settlement  beginning in through pge has agreed to cap and reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions to levels lower than those specified in the oeqc plan described above and further agreed to pay certain public interest groups a total of million for various air quality projects 
the scheduled shutdown of coal fired operations at the boardman plant results in increased revenue requirements for idaho power related to accelerated depreciation expense  additional plant investments  and decommissioning costs 
as a result  in response to an application idaho power filed in september  on february  the ipuc issued an order accepting idaho power s regulatory accounting and cost recovery plan associated with the early shut down and approving the establishment of a balancing account whereby incremental costs and benefits associated with the early shut down will be tracked for recovery in a subsequent proceeding 
on february   idaho power filed an application with the ipuc requesting a million annual increase in idaho jurisdiction base rates to recover the incremental idaho jurisdictional annual revenue deficiency associated with early shut down 
as of december   idaho power s net book value in the boardman plant was approximately million with annual depreciation of approximately million 
new source review nsr since  the epa and the us department of justice have been pursuing a national enforcement initiative focused on the compliance status of coal fired power plants with the nsr permitting requirements and nsps of the caa 
this initiative has resulted in both enforcement litigation and significant settlements with a large number of public utilities and other owners of coal fired power plants across the country 
the epa sent information requests under the caa  requesting information relevant to nsr and nsps compliance  to the jim bridger plant in  the valmy plant in  and the boardman plant in with a follow up request for information in in september  the epa issued a notice of violation to pge  alleging that pge has violated the nsps under section iii of the caa and operating permit requirements under title v of the caa at the boardman coal fired plant as a result of certain modifications made to the plant in and see note contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of the boardman epa notice of violation 
coal combustion residuals ccrs in december  the breach of a dike at the tennessee valley authority s kingston station resulted in a spill of several million cubic yards of ash into a nearby river and onto private properties 
in june  the epa proposed regulations pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act governing the disposal and management of ccrs 
the epa requested comments on two options for regulating ccrs 
the first would regulate ccrs as a new special waste subject to many of the requirements for hazardous waste  while the second would regulate ccrs in a manner similar to typical solid waste  subject to fewer and less stringent environmental requirements 
the epa initiated a public comment period and held public hearings  which ended in november either of the epa s proposed options represents a shift toward more comprehensive and potentially more expensive requirements for ccrs disposal and management 
if this or other new legislation or regulations increase the cost of managing and disposing of ccrs or create additional liability with respect to historic disposal practices  they could have an adverse impact on idaho power s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  the financial and operational consequences cannot be determined until final legislation is passed or regulations are enacted 
polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in april  the epa issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to the toxic substances control act regarding the use of pcbs 
the epa is considering revisiting the use authorization allowing the continued use of pcbs in equipment 
if new regulations require the replacement of existing equipment  they could have an adverse effect on idaho power s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  the financial and operational consequences cannot be determined until final regulations are enacted 
idaho power currently records asset retirement obligation liabilities and associated regulatory assets for the estimated retirement costs of equipment containing pcbs 
proposed regulations could accelerate idaho power s estimated timing of the retirements of equipment with pcbs 
clean water act section b in march  the epa issued a proposed rule that would establish requirements under section b of the cwa for all existing power generating facilities and existing manufacturing and industrial facilities that withdraw more than million gallons per day mgd of water from waters of the us and use at least percent of the water they withdraw exclusively for cooling purposes 
the proposed rules would establish national requirements applicable to the location  design  construction  and capacity of cooling water intake structures at these facilities by setting requirements that reflect the best technology available bta for minimizing adverse environmental impact 
the existing facility may choose one of two options for meeting bta requirements for impingement mortality under this proposed rule 
the owner or operator may monitor to show the specified performance standards for impingement mortality of fish and shellfish have been met  or they may demonstrate that the intake velocity meets specified design criteria 
for entrainment mortality  this proposed rule establishes requirements for studies and information as part of the permit application  and then establishes a process by which the bta for entrainment mortality would be implemented at each facility 
idaho power expects the draft rule to be issued in the first half of based on the qualification criteria  idaho power expects that the new requirements would apply to the jim bridger plant  but is unable to determine the potential increased costs that may result from implementation of the rule until final rules are issued and it has performed cost studies 
public nuisance related suits for ghgs in december  the us supreme court granted certiorari in connecticut v 
american electric power  inc  to review the opinion from the us court of appeals for the second circuit granting plaintiffs standing to bring climate change related public nuisance suits against six major emitters of greenhouse gases ghgs 
in june  the us supreme court held that federal courts do not have jurisdiction to hear federal common law nuisance claims relating to ghg emissions  because the legal authority to regulate ghgs has been delegated by congress to the epa  not to federal courts 
even though the court rejected the merits of the plaintiffs claim  the court nevertheless held that the plaintiffs had the requisite legal standing to bring the claims 
finally  the court remanded to the second circuit the issue of whether state common law nuisance claims would also be barred by the federal caa 
accordingly  the decision of the supreme court in this case does not eliminate the potential for future nuisance related suits based on ghg emissions 
renewable energy certificates and emission allowances pursuant to an ipuc order  idaho power is selling its near term recs and returning to customers their share shared with customers in the idaho jurisdiction of those proceeds through the pca 
for the year ended december   idaho power s rec sales totaled million 
idaho power has sold all of its and earlier vintage recs 
idaho power has sold a portion of its recs and intends to continue selling its and later recs as they are generated and become available for sale 
ordinarily  idaho power does not receive the recs associated with purpa projects 
endangered species the listing of a species as threatened or endangered may have an adverse impact on idaho power s ability to construct generation  transmission  or distribution facilities or to relicense its hydroelectric projects 
several notable matters pertaining to threatened or endangered species and affecting idaho power are discussed below 
slickspot peppergrass this southwestern idaho plant species was listed as threatened by the usfws in while critical habitat for the plant was not designated at the time of listing  approximately percent of the plant species is located on federal land owned by the blm and the us department of defense 
parts of the boardman to hemingway and gateway west kv transmission lines will cross blm land 
this listing will add an additional requirement and species for consideration in the esa section consultation 
a section consultation is a process used to determine a proposed action s effects on any esa listed species that may be within the project area 
this listing may increase the expense and delay the timing of permitting for these projects 
sage grouse the sage grouse is considered a candidate species under the esa  which allows land management agencies to implement additional conservation measures in an effort to prevent a formal esa listing 
in march  the usfws announced that listing of the greater sage grouse as threatened or endangered under the esa is warranted  but precluded by higher priority listing actions 
on february   a federal district court in idaho issued an order denying a request to expedite the listing of the sage grouse under the esa 
as a result  the usfws has until to make a final listing determination under the esa 
on february   the same court issued an order holding that the blm had violated the national environmental policy act and other federal laws in connection with the granting of livestock grazing permit renewals in sage grouse habitat 
due to the presence of sage grouse in the vicinity  siting of the boardman to hemingway and gateway west kv transmission lines has required more extensive  costly  and time consuming evaluation  permitting  and engineering 
any required additional conservation measures may increase the costs of existing operations and impact the cost and timing of siting  permitting  and construction of the boardman to hemingway and gateway west transmission lines and other construction and transmission projects 
listing of the greater sage grouse as threatened or endangered under the esa would add an additional requirement and species for consideration in esa section consultations for those projects  and may increase the expense and adversely affect the cost and timing of those projects 
hells canyon project in  the ferc requested initiation of formal consultation under the esa with the national marine fisheries service nmfs and the usfws regarding potential effects of hcc relicensing on several listed aquatic and terrestrial species 
formal consultation has not yet been initiated and nmfs and usfws continue to gather and consider information relative to the effects of relicensing on relevant species 
idaho power continues to cooperate with the usfws  the nmfs  and the ferc in an effort to address esa concerns 
idaho power may be required to modify operations pursuant to the biological opinion that will result from formal consultation 
however  the issuance of a final biological opinion during is unlikely 
bliss and lower salmon falls projects as part of a settlement agreement  idaho power has finalized a snail protection plan for the bliss and lower salmon falls projects in cooperation with the usfws 
idaho power has filed applications with the ferc to amend the licenses for the projects that will maintain operating flexibility at both projects for the remainder of their licenses 
the ferc and usfws are conducting an esa section consultation on two esa listed snails  the bliss rapids snail and the snake river physa snail 
idaho power has been working closely with usfws to develop the necessary biological information to complete the consultation 
a biological assessment for the snake river physa snail  jointly developed between the usfws and idaho power  was filed with the ferc in september the biological assessment evaluates the potential impacts of the license amendment on the snake river physa snail 
idaho power anticipates that the ferc will request formal consultation with the usfws during the second half of the usfws will then develop a biological opinion on the effects of load following on both types of snails 
swan falls project in august  the ferc issued a final eis in connection with the relicensing of the sfp 
the snake river physa snail  a species listed as endangered under the esa  was found in the area during the eis review 
while the biological opinion includes a provision for the incidental take of the snail  idaho power is required to study the status of the snake river physa snail and its habitat within and downstream of the project area for the term of the new license 
critical accounting policies and estimates when preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  idacorp s and idaho power s management must apply accounting policies and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates often involve judgment about factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
management adjusts these estimates based on historical experience and on other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could materially differ from the estimates 
management believes the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
accounting for rate regulation entities that meet specific conditions are required by gaap to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their consolidated financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until matching revenues can be recognized 
similarly  certain items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities 
idaho power must satisfy three conditions to apply regulatory accounting an independent regulator must set rates  the regulator must set the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory must lack competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
idaho power has determined that it meets these conditions  and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating idaho power 
the primary effect of this policy is that idaho power has recorded million of regulatory assets and million of regulatory liabilities at december  idaho power expects to recover these regulatory assets from customers through rates and refund these regulatory liabilities to customers through rates  but recovery or refund is subject to final review by the regulatory bodies 
if future recovery or refund of these amounts ceases to be probable  or if idaho power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting  or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities  idaho power would be required to eliminate those regulatory assets or liabilities  unless regulators specify some other means of recovery or refund 
either circumstance could have a material effect on idaho power s results of operations and financial position 
income taxes idacorp and idaho power use judgment and estimation in developing the provision for income taxes and the reporting of tax related assets and liabilities 
the interpretation of tax laws can involve uncertainty  since tax authorities may interpret such laws differently 
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts and may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income  cash flows  and tax related assets and liabilities 
idaho power s deferred income taxes for plant related items commonly referred to as normalized accounting are primarily provided for the difference between income tax depreciation and book depreciation used for financial statement purposes 
unless contrary to applicable income tax guidance  deferred income taxes are not provided for those income tax timing differences where the prescribed regulatory accounting methods direct idaho power to recognize the tax impacts currently for rate making and financial reporting 
in september  the irs issued idd  which discusses the irs s compliance priorities and audit techniques related to the allocation of mixed service costs in the uniform capitalization methods of electric utilities 
since that time  the irs and idaho power agreed to a method consistent with the idd guidance and changed idaho power s uniform capitalization method 
in  idaho power provided a current uncertain tax position liability equal to the net tax benefit recorded for the method change until the agreement with the irs was approved by the joint committee 
this approval occurred in the third quarter of  which effectively settled the issue for financial reporting purposes 
no material uncertain tax positions remained at december  asset impairment available for sale securities idaho power is required to evaluate available for sale securities periodically to determine whether a decline in fair value below cost is other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is other than temporary  the cost of the investment is written down to fair value and the loss is recorded as a realized loss 
two significant factors that are considered when evaluating investments for impairment are the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost 
idaho power has investments in four mutual funds that experienced a significant decline in fair value in idaho power s investments had lost between percent and percent of their value  primarily during the stock market downturn in september and october  and had been in loss positions from to months at december  because of the severity of the declines in value  idaho power determined that the loss in value was other than temporary and recorded a pre tax loss of million in the fourth quarter of at december  and  the fair values of these investments were at or above their new cost bases and no impairment was recorded 
equity method investments ifs has affordable housing investments with a net book value of million at december   and ida west has investments in four joint ventures that own electric power generation facilities 
except for one investment which is consolidated  these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the standard for determining whether impairment must be recorded for these investments is whether the investment has experienced a loss in value that is considered an other than temporary decline in value 
impairment analyses are performed on these investments when indicators of impairment are noted 
an immaterial impairment was recorded on one of the ida west joint ventures in  and no impairments were recorded in or in these estimates required idacorp to make assumptions about future revenues  cash flows  and other items that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could vary significantly from the assumptions used  and the impact of such variations could be material 
pension and other postretirement benefits idaho power maintains a tax qualified  noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees  an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain senior management employees and directors called the senior management security plan smsp  and a postretirement benefit plan consisting of health care and death benefits 
the costs idacorp and idaho power record for these plans depend on the provisions of the plans  changing employee demographics  actual returns on plan assets  and several assumptions used in the actuarial valuations from which the expense is derived 
the key actuarial assumptions that affect expense are the expected long term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations 
management evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis  taking into account changes in market conditions  trends  and future expectations 
estimates of future stock market performance  changes in interest rates  and other factors used to develop the actuarial assumptions are uncertain  and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates 
the assumed discount rate is based on reviews of market yields on high quality corporate debt 
specifically  idacorp and idaho power determined the discount rate for each plan through the construction of hypothetical portfolios of bonds selected from high quality corporate bonds available as of december   with maturities matching the projected cash outflows of the plans 
the discount rate used to calculate the pension expense will be decreased to percent from the percent used in rate of return projections for plan assets are based on historical risk return relationships among asset classes 
the primary measure is the historical risk premium each asset class has delivered versus the return on year us treasury notes 
this historical risk premium is then added to the current yield on year us treasury notes  and the result provides a reasonable prediction of future investment performance 
additional analysis is performed to measure the expected range of returns  as well as worst case and best case scenarios 
based on the current interest rate environment  current rate of return expectations are lower than the nominal returns generated over the past years when interest rates were generally much higher 
the long term rate of return used to calculate the pension expense will be percent  compared to the percent rate used for gross pension and other postretirement benefit expense for these plans totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  including amounts allocated to capitalized labor and amounts deferred as regulatory assets 
for  gross pension and other postretirement benefit costs are expected to total approximately million  which takes into account the change in the discount rate noted above  as well as a decrease in expected return on plan assets 
no changes were made to the other key assumptions used in the actuarial calculation 
had different actuarial assumptions been used  pension expense could have varied significantly 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with changes in the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets actuarial assumptions on historical and future pension and postretirement expense discount rate rate of return millions of dollars effect of increase on net periodic benefit cost effect of decrease on net periodic benefit cost additionally a percent increase in the plans discount rates would have resulted in a million decrease in the combined benefit obligations of the plans as of december  a percent decrease in the plans discount rates would have resulted in a million increase in the combined benefit obligations of the plans as of december  no cash contributions were made to the defined benefit pension plan in contributions of million and million were made in and  respectively 
contributions required to be made during are estimated to be million 
payments of million  million  million  and million are estimated to be due in    and  respectively 
under the smsp  idaho power makes payments directly to participants in the plan 
benefit payments are expected to be million in and averaged million per year from to postretirement benefit plan contributions are expected to be million in  and averaged million from to the ipuc has authorized idaho power to account for its defined benefit pension plan expense on a cash basis  and to defer and account for accrued pension expense as a regulatory asset 
the ipuc acknowledged that it is appropriate for idaho power to seek recovery in its revenue requirement of reasonable and prudently incurred pension expense based on actual cash contributions 
in  idaho power began deferring pension expense to a regulatory asset account to be matched with revenue when future pension contributions are recovered through rates 
at december   million of expense was deferred as a regulatory asset 
approximately million is expected to be deferred in idaho power recorded pension expense in   and of million  million  and million  respectively 
refer to note benefit plans of the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information relating to pension and postretirement benefit plans 
contingent liabilities an estimated loss from a loss contingency is charged to income if a it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated  no accrual is recorded but disclosure of the contingency in the notes to the financial statements is required 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 
idacorp and idaho power have a number of unresolved issues related to regulatory and legal matters 
if the recognition criteria have been met  liabilities have been recorded 
estimates of this nature are highly subjective and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements there have been no recently issued accounting pronouncements that have had or are expected to have a material impact on idacorp s or idaho power s results of operations or financial condition 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a summary of significant accounting policies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk idacorp and idaho power are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates  changes in commodity prices  credit risk  and equity price risk 
the following discussion summarizes these risks and the financial instruments  derivative instruments  and derivative commodity instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates  commodity prices  and equity prices that were held at december  interest rate risk idacorp and idaho power manage interest expense and short and long term liquidity through a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
generally  the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance  but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highly rated financial institutions may be used to achieve the desired combination 
variable rate debt as of december   idacorp and idaho power had million and million  respectively  in net floating rate debt 
the fair market value of this debt was million and million  respectively 
assuming no change in financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average one percentage point higher than the average rate on december   interest rate expense would increase and pre tax earnings would decrease by approximately million for idacorp and million for idaho power 
fixed rate debt as of december   idacorp and idaho power each had billion in fixed rate debt  with a fair market value equal to billion 
these instruments are fixed rate and  therefore  do not expose the companies to a loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million for both idacorp and idaho power if interest rates were to decline by one percentage point from their december  levels 
commodity price risk idaho power s exposure to changes in commodity prices is related to its ongoing utility operations that produce electricity to meet the demand of its retail electric customers 
to supplement its generation resources and balance its supply of power with the demand of its retail customers  idaho power participates in the wholesale marketplace 
these purchased power arrangements allow idaho power to respond to fluctuations in the demand for electricity and variability in generating plant operations 
idaho power also enters into arrangements for the purchase of fuel for natural gas and coal fired generating plants 
idaho power anticipates that the additional volume of natural gas needed to operate the langley gulch power plant will increase its exposure in the future to natural gas commodity price risk 
these contracts for the purchase of power and fuel expose idaho power to commodity price risk 
a number of factors associated with the structure and operation of the energy markets influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products 
the weather is a major uncontrollable factor affecting the local and regional demand for electricity and the availability and cost of production 
other factors include the occurrence and timing of demand peaks due to seasonal  daily  and hourly power demand  power supply  power transmission capacity  changes in federal and state regulation and compliance obligations  fuel supplies  and market liquidity 
idaho power s exposure to commodity price risk is largely offset by the pca mechanisms in idaho and oregon 
therefore  the primary objectives of idaho power s energy purchase and sale activity are to meet the demand of retail electric customers  maintain appropriate physical reserves to ensure reliability  and make economic use of temporary surpluses that may develop 
idaho power has adopted a risk management program  which has been reviewed and accepted by the ipuc  designed to reduce exposure to power supply cost related uncertainty  further mitigating commodity price risk 
idaho power s energy risk management policy policy and associated standards implementing the policy describe a collaborative process with customers and regulators via a committee called the customer advisory group cag 
the risk management committee rmc  comprised of selected idaho power officers and other senior staff  oversees the risk management program 
the rmc is responsible for communicating the status of risk management activities to the idaho power board of directors and to the cag  and idaho power s audit committee is responsible for approving the policy and associated standards 
the rmc is also responsible for conducting an ongoing general assessment of the appropriateness of idaho power s strategies for energy risk management activities 
in its risk management process  idaho power considers both demand side and supply side options consistent with its irp 
the primary tools for risk mitigation are physical and financial forward power transactions and fueling alternatives for utility owned generation resources 
idaho power does not engage in trading activities for non retail purposes 
the policy requires monitoring monthly volumetric electricity position and total monthly dollar net power supply cost exposure on a rolling month forward view 
the power supply business unit produces and evaluates projections of the operating plan based on factors such as forecasted resource availability  stream flows  and load  and orders risk mitigating actions  including resource optimization and hedging strategies  dictated by the limits stated in the policy to bring exposures within pre established risk guidelines 
the rmc evaluates the actions initiated by power supply for consistency and compliance with the policy 
idaho power representatives meet with the cag at least annually to assess effectiveness of the limits 
changes to the limits can be endorsed by the cag and referred to the board of directors for approval 
credit risk idaho power is subject to credit risk based on its activity with market counterparties 
idaho power is exposed to this risk to the extent that a counterparty may fail to fulfill a contractual obligation to provide energy  purchase energy  or complete financial settlement for market activities 
idaho power mitigates this exposure by actively establishing credit limits  measuring  monitoring  and reporting credit risk using appropriate contractual arrangements  and transferring of credit risk through the use of financial guarantees  cash or letters of credit 
idaho power maintains a current list of acceptable counterparties and credit limits 
the use of performance assurance collateral in the form of cash  letters of credit  or guarantees is common industry practice 
idaho power maintains margin agreements relating to its wholesale commodity contracts that allow performance assurance collateral to be requested of and or posted with certain counterparties 
as of december   idaho power had posted no performance assurance collateral 
should idaho power experience a reduction in its credit rating on idaho power s unsecured debt to below investment grade  idaho power could be subject to requests by its wholesale counterparties to post performance assurance collateral 
counterparties to derivative instruments and other forward contracts could request immediate payment or demand immediate ongoing full daily collateralization on derivative instruments and contracts in net liability positions 
based upon idaho power s current energy and fuel portfolio and market conditions as of december   the approximate amount of collateral that could be requested upon a downgrade to below investment grade is approximately million 
idaho power actively monitors the portfolio exposure and the potential exposure to additional requests for performance assurance collateral calls  through sensitivity analysis  to minimize capital requirements 
idaho power is obligated to provide service to all electric customers within its service area 
credit risk for idaho power s retail customers is managed by credit and collection policies that are governed by rules issued by the ipuc or opuc 
idaho power records a provision for uncollectible accounts  based upon historical experience  to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers 
idaho power will continue to monitor the impact of the current economic conditions on nonpayment from customers and will make any necessary adjustments to its provision for uncollectible accounts 
idaho utility customer relations rules prohibit idaho power from terminating electric service during the months of december through february to any residential customer who declares that he or she is unable to pay in full for utility service and whose household includes children  elderly  or infirm persons 
idaho power s provision for uncollectible accounts could be affected by changes in future prices as well as changes in ipuc or opuc regulations 
equity price risk idacorp and idaho power are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets  primarily through their defined benefit pension plan assets  a mine reclamation trust fund owned by an equity method investment of idaho power  and other equity investments at idaho power 
during  the fair value of the defined benefit pension plan s assets decreased slightly  however  increases in the benefit liabilities were greater than the increases in the plan s assets  therefore resulting in an increase in future amounts required to be contributed to the plan 
based on current laws  idaho power estimates that the minimum contribution to the defined benefit pension plan in will be approximately million 
a hypothetical ten percent decrease in equity prices would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of financial instruments that are classified as available for sale securities as of december
