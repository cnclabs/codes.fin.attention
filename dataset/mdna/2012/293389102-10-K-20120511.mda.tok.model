item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this report on factors impacting our apparel sales 
research and development while we seek new products to sell through our distribution channel  there have been no material amounts spent on research and development in the fiscal year ended february  
table of contents environment we are subject to various federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  wastewater discharges  air emissions and solid waste disposal 
our manufacturing processes do not emit substantial foreign substances into the environment 
we do not believe that our compliance with federal  state  or local statutes or regulations relating to the protection of the environment has any material effect upon capital expenditures  earnings or our competitive position 
there can be no assurance  however  that future changes in federal  state  or local regulations  interpretations of existing regulations or the discovery of currently unknown problems or conditions will not require substantial additional expenditures 
similarly  the extent of our liability  if any  for past failures to comply with laws  regulations  and permits applicable to our operations cannot be determined 
employees at february   we had approximately  employees 
approximately  of the employees are in mexico  and approximately employees are in canada 
of the domestic employees  approximately are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements  which are subject to periodic renegotiations 
three unions represent all of our hourly employees in mexico with contracts expiring at various times

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below  as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  before making an investment in our common stock 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face in our business 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed 
in such an event  our common stock could decline in price and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions  and competitors pricing strategies  which can adversely affect our sales  margins  and net income 
our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions  but also by local market conditions  and competitors pricing strategies  which can vary substantially by market 
unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may prompt promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins  constrain our operating flexibility or result in charges 
certain macroeconomic events  such as the recent crisis in the financial markets  could have a more wide ranging and prolonged impact on the general business environment  which could also adversely affect us 
whether we can manage these risks effectively depends mainly on the following our ability to manage upward pressure on commodity prices and the impact of government actions to manage national economic conditions such as consumer spending  inflation rates and unemployment levels  particularly given the current volatility in the global financial markets  the impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor intensive business model  the trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and the potential impact of union organizing efforts on day to day operations of our manufacturing facilities 

table of contents declining economic conditions could negatively impact our business 
our operations are affected by local  national and worldwide economic conditions 
markets in the united states and elsewhere have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption due in part to the financial stresses affecting the liquidity of the banking system and the financial markets generally 
the consequences of a potential or prolonged recession may include a lower level of economic activity and uncertainty regarding energy prices and the capital and commodity markets  all of what we have seen of late 
a lower level of economic activity might result in a decline in demand for our products  which may adversely affect our revenues and future growth 
instability in the financial markets  as a result of recession or otherwise  also may affect our cost of capital and our ability to raise capital 
the terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our operations 
we may not be able to raise additional capital  if needed  for proposed expansion projects 
the terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt  make capital expenditures  acquisitions  asset dispositions  as well as other customary covenants  such as minimum equity level and total funded debt to ebitda  as defined 
our ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  such as distressed and volatile financial markets which could trigger an impairment charge to our recorded intangible assets 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility 
in the event of a default  the bank could elect to declare the outstanding principal amount of our credit facility  all interest thereon  and all other amounts payable under our credit facility to be immediately due and payable 
as of february   we were in compliance with all terms and conditions of our credit facility  which matures on august  declining financial market conditions could adversely impact the funding status of our pension plan 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering approximately of our employees 
included in our financial results are pension costs that are measured using actuarial valuations 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual results 
in addition  as our pension assets are invested in marketable securities  severe fluctuations in market values could potentially negatively impact our funding status  recorded pension liability  and future required minimum contribution levels 
we may be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets which could cause our financial condition and results of operations to be negatively affected in the future 
when we acquire a business  a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
the amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable tangible assets acquired 
the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment 
a decline in market conditions may indicate a potential impairment of goodwill 
an impairment test was completed for our fiscal year february   and we concluded that no impairment charge was necessary 
at february   our goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately million and million  respectively 
digital technologies will continue to erode the demand for our printed business documents 
the increasing sophistication of software  internet technologies  and digital equipment combined with our customers general preference  as well as governmental influences  for paperless business environments will continue to reduce the number of printed documents sold 
moreover  the documents that will continue to coexist with software applications will likely contain less value added print content 
many of our custom printed documents help companies control their internal business processes and facilitate the flow of information 
these applications will increasingly be conducted over the internet or through other electronic payment systems 
the predominant method of our clients communication to their customers is by printed information 
as their customers become more accepting of internet communications  our clients may increasingly opt for the less costly electronic option  which would reduce our revenue 
the pace of these trends is difficult to predict 
these factors will tend to reduce the industry wide demand for printed documents and require us to gain market share to maintain or increase our current level of print based revenue 
in response to the gradual obsolescence of our standardized forms business  we continue to develop our capability to provide custom and full color products 
if new printing capabilities and new product introductions do not continue to offset the obsolescence of our standardized business forms products  and we aren t able to increase our market share  our sales and profits will be affected 
decreases in sales of our standardized business forms and 
table of contents products due to obsolescence could also reduce our gross margins 
this reduction could in turn adversely impact our profits  unless we are able to offset the reduction through the introduction of new high margin products and services or realize cost savings in other areas 
our distributors face increased competition from various sources  such as office supply superstores 
increased competition may require us to reduce prices or to offer other incentives in order to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers 
low price  high value office supply chain stores offer standardized business forms  checks and related products 
because of their size  these superstores have the buying power to offer many of these products at competitive prices 
these superstores also offer the convenience of one stop shopping for a broad array of office supplies that our distributors do not offer 
in addition  superstores have the financial strength to reduce prices or increase promotional discounts to expand market share 
this could result in us reducing our prices or offering incentives in order to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers 
technological improvements may reduce our competitive advantage over some of our competitors  which could reduce our profits 
improvements in the cost and quality of printing technology are enabling some of our competitors to gain access to products of complex design and functionality at competitive costs 
increased competition from these competitors could force us to reduce our prices in order to attract and retain customers  which could reduce our profits 
we could experience labor disputes that could disrupt our business in the future 
as of february   approximately of our domestic employees are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements  which are subject to periodic renegotiations 
three unions represent all of our hourly employees in mexico 
while we feel we have a good working relationship with all the unions  there can be no assurance that any future labor negotiations will prove successful  which may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor  or may break down and result in the disruption of our business or operations 
we obtain our raw materials from a limited number of suppliers  and any disruption in our relationships with these suppliers  or any substantial increase in the price of raw materials or material shortages could have a material adverse effect on us 
cotton yarn is the primary raw material used in alstyle s manufacturing processes 
cotton accounts for approximately of the manufactured product cost at current pricing levels 
alstyle acquires its yarn from three major sources that meet stringent quality and on time delivery requirements 
the largest supplier provided of alstyle s yarn requirements during the year and has an entire yarn mill dedicated to alstyle s production 
to maintain our high standard of color control associated with our apparel products  we purchase our dyeing chemicals from limited sources 
if alstyle s relations with its suppliers are disrupted  alstyle may not be able to enter into arrangements with substitute suppliers on terms as favorable as its current terms  and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we also purchase our paper products from a limited number of sources  which meet stringent quality and on time delivery standards under long term contracts 
however  fluctuations in the quality of our paper  unexpected price increases or other factors that relate to our paper products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
both cotton and paper are commodities that are subject to periodic increases or decreases in price  sometimes quite significant 
there is no effective market to cost effectively insulate us against unexpected changes in price of paper  and corporate negotiated purchase contracts provide only limited protection against price increases 
we generally acquire our cotton yarn under short term purchase contracts with our suppliers 
while we generally do not use derivative instruments  including cotton option contracts  to manage our exposure to movements in cotton market prices  we believe we are competitive with other companies in the united states apparel industry in negotiating the price of cotton 
during fiscal year  spot cotton prices increased significantly  however  manufacturers were able to insulate themselves from some of these increases with forward purchase contracts 
however  because spot cotton prices remained at these levels for a sustained period of time  these favorable forward contracts expired and were replaced with higher priced contracts which are now significantly higher than current spot cotton prices 
these higher priced contracts are what have been and will continue to be flowing into large manufacturer s cost of goods sold over the next several quarters 
generally  when cotton or paper prices are increased  we attempt to recover the higher costs by raising the prices of our products to our customers 
in the price competitive 
table of contents marketplaces in which we operate  we may not always be able to pass through any or all of the higher costs 
as such  any significant increase in the price of paper or cotton or shortages in the availability of either  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we face intense competition to gain market share  which may lead some competitors to sell substantial amounts of goods at prices against which we cannot profitably compete 
demand for alstyle s products is dependent on the general demand for shirts and the availability of alternative sources of supply 
alstyle s strategy in this market environment is to be a low cost producer and to differentiate itself by providing quality service and quality products to its customers 
even if this strategy is successful  its results may be offset by reductions in demand or price declines due to competitors pricing strategies 
our print segment also faces the risk of our competition following a strategy of selling their products at or below cost in order to cover some amount of fixed costs  especially in distressed economic times 
the apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles 
the apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending  which changes as regional  domestic and international economic conditions change 
these include  but are not limited to  employment levels  energy costs  interest rates  tax rates  personal debt levels  and uncertainty about the future 
any deterioration in general economic conditions that creates uncertainty or alters discretionary consumer spending habits could reduce our sales  increase our costs of goods sold or require us to significantly modify our current business practices  and consequently negatively impact our results of operations 
our foreign based apparel operations could be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other market barriers  political and economic instability  and social unrest in the countries where it operates  which could negatively impact our operating results 
alstyle operates manufacturing facilities in mexico and sources certain product manufacturing and purchases from el salvador  thailand  india  pakistan  china and other foreign sources 
alstyle s foreign operations could be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  and other market barriers  political and economic instability  and social unrest in the countries where it operates 
the impact of any such events that may occur in the future could subject alstyle to additional costs or loss of sales  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in particular  alstyle operates its facilities in mexico pursuant to the maquiladora duty free program established by the mexican and united states governments 
this program enables alstyle to take advantage of generally lower costs in mexico  without paying duty on inventory shipped into or out of mexico 
there can be no assurance that the governments of mexico and the united states will continue the program currently in place or that alstyle will continue to be able to benefit from this program 
the loss of these benefits could have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  all alstyle s knit and dye operations are now located in one facility in agua prieta  mexico 
any disruptions in operations through any of the above factors  as well as others  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operational results 
our apparel products are subject to foreign competition  which in the past have been faced with significant us government import restrictions 
foreign producers of apparel often have significant labor cost advantages 
given the number of these foreign producers  the substantial elimination of import protections that protect domestic apparel producers could materially adversely affect alstyle s business 
the extent of import protection afforded to domestic apparel producers has been  and is likely to remain  subject to considerable political considerations 
the north american free trade agreement nafta became effective on january  and has created a free trade zone among canada  mexico  and the united states 
nafta contains a rule of origin requirement that products be produced in one of the three countries in order to benefit from the agreement 
nafta has phased out all trade restrictions and tariffs among the three countries on apparel products competitive with those of alstyle 
alstyle manufactures all of its products in the agua prieta manufacturing plant and performs substantially all of its cutting and sewing in five plants located in mexico in order to take advantage of the nafta benefits 
subsequent repeal or alteration of nafta could adversely affect our business 
the central american free trade agreement cafta became effective may  and retroactive to january  for textiles and apparel 
it creates a free trade zone similar to nafta by and between the united 
table of contents states and central american countries el salvador  honduras  costa rica  nicaragua  and dominican republic 
textiles and apparel are duty free and quota free immediately if they meet the agreement s rule of origin  promoting new opportunities for us and central american fiber  yarn  fabric and apparel manufacturing 
the agreement gives duty free benefits to some apparel made in central america that contains certain fabrics from nafta partners mexico and canada 
alstyle did not outsource any of its production to outside contract manufacturers in the last two quarters of this fiscal year  and we do not anticipate that alteration or subsequent repeal of cafta would have a material effect on our operations  other than improvement over our competitive capabilities 
the world trade organization wto  a multilateral trade organization  was formed in january and is the successor to the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt 
this multilateral trade organization has set forth mechanisms by which world trade in clothing is being progressively liberalized by phasing out quotas and reducing duties over a period of time that began in january of as it implements the wto mechanisms  the united states government is negotiating bilateral trade agreements with developing countries  which are generally exporters of textile and apparel products  that are members of the wto to get them to reduce their tariffs on imports of textiles and apparel in exchange for reductions by the united states in tariffs on imports of textiles and apparel 
in january  united states import quotas were removed on knitted shirts from china 
the elimination of quotas and the reduction of tariffs under the wto may result in increased imports of certain apparel products into north america 
in may  quotas on three categories of clothing imports  including knitted shirts  from china were re imposed 
a reduction of import quotas and tariffs could make alstyle s products less competitive against low cost imports from developing countries 
environmental regulations may impact our future operating results 
we are subject to extensive and changing federal  state and foreign laws and regulations establishing health and environmental quality standards  and may be subject to liability or penalties for violations of those standards 
we are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or to which we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment  recycling or disposal 
we may be subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations 
in addition  we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities  or at facilities we may acquire 
our new apparel manufacturing facility in mexico is subject to certain risks regarding sales growth and cost savings  as well as transition risks associated with moving the current production 
our new manufacturing facility was built to capture anticipated future growth and savings in production costs over our cost structure in anaheim  ca 
should such growth or production savings not materialize  such events may impact our ability to achieve our expected return and or could negatively impact our operational results and financial condition 
we are exposed to the risk of non payment by our customers on a significant amount of our sales 
our extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition and payment history 
we monitor our credit risk exposure by periodically obtaining credit reports and updated financials on our customers 
we saw a heightened amount of bankruptcies by our customers  especially retailers  during the recent economic downturn 
while we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables for potential credit losses based upon our historical trends and other available information  in times of economic turmoil  there is heightened risk that our historical indicators may prove to be inaccurate 
the inability to collect on sales to significant customers or a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our business incurs significant freight and transportation costs 
we incur significant freight costs to transport our goods  especially as it relates to our apparel segment where we transport yarn from our domestic suppliers to our textile facility in mexico 
the internal freight from the textile to the sewing facilities  as well as the logistic cost of keeping our product in the distribution centers to maintain our product close to the customer and on time to market is also significant 
in addition  we incur transportation expenses to ship our products to our customers 
significant increases in the costs of freight and transportation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  as there can be no assurance that we could pass these increased costs to our customers 

table of contents the price of energy is prone to significant fluctuations and volatility 
our apparel manufacturing operations require high inputs of energy  and therefore changes in energy prices directly impact our gross profit margins 
we are focusing on manufacturing methods that will reduce the amount of energy used in the production of our apparel products to mitigate the rising costs of energy 
significant increases in energy prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  as there can be no assurance that we could pass these increased costs to our customers  given the competitive environment in which our apparel segment operates 
we depend upon the talents and contributions of a limited number of individuals  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
the loss or interruption of the services of our chief executive officer  executive vice president  vice president of apparel or chief financial officer could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
although we maintain employment agreements with these individuals  it cannot be assured that the services of such individuals will continue 
increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact the company s financial results and cash flow 
the company s expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant 
unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could impact the company s financial results and cash flow 
healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years  and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the us healthcare system 
the company is not able at this time to determine the impact that healthcare reform could have on the company sponsored medical plans

overview the company we are one of the largest providers of business forms to independent distributors in the united states and are also one of the largest providers of blank t shirts in north america to the activewear market 
we operate in two reportable segments print and apparel 
our print business challenges in our print segment  we are engaged in an industry undergoing significant changes 
technology advances have made electronic distribution of documents  internet hosting  digital printing and print on demand valid  cost effective alternatives to traditional custom printed documents and customer communications 
in addition  the recent downturn in the economy and credit markets which created highly competitive conditions in an already over supplied  price competitive industry  continue to present challenges today 
thus  we believe we are facing the following challenges in the print segment of our business transformation of our portfolio of products excess production capacity and price competition within our industry continued economic uncertainties the following is a discussion of these business challenges and our strategy for managing their effect on our print business 
transformation of our portfolio of products traditional business documents are essential in order to conduct business 
however  many are being replaced or devalued with advances in digital technologies  causing steady 
table of contents declines in demand for a large portion of our current product line 
the same digital advances also introduce potential new opportunities for growth for us  such as print on demand services and product offerings that assist customers in their transition to digital business environments 
we currently have many innovative products  such as our recently introduced healthcare wristbands  secure document solutions  and innovative in mold label offerings  which address important business needs  and we feel are positioned for growth 
in addition  we will continue to look for new market opportunities and niches  such as our addition of our envelope offerings and long run integrated products with high color web printing that provide us with an opportunity for growth and differentiate us from our competition 
transforming our product offerings to continue to provide innovative  valuable solutions to our customers on a proactive basis will require us to make investments in new and existing technology and to develop key strategic business relationships 
excess production capacity and price competition within our industry paper mills continue to adjust production capacity through downtime and closures to attempt to keep supply in line with demand 
due to the limited number of paper mills  paper prices have been and are expected to remain fairly volatile 
in  we saw our material prices stabilize due to the depressed economic conditions 
however  during fiscal year paper mills returned to their past practices of increasing paper prices and this trend continued throughout fiscal year despite a continued competitive marketplace  we have generally been able to pass through increased paper costs  although it can often take several quarters to push these through due to the custom nature of our products and or contractual relationships with some of our customers 
we expect this trend to continue  however  any downturn in the economy or continued protraction of the current recovery may limit our ability to recover all these costs 
as such  we will continue to focus our efforts on effectively managing and controlling our product costs to minimize the effects of the foregoing on our operational results  primarily through the use of forecasting models  and production and costing models 
however  an inherent risk in this process is that our assumptions are inaccurate  which could have a negative impact on our reported profit margins 
continued economic uncertainties as a result of the past recessionary conditions of and  the economic climate has been volatile and challenging 
decreased demand and intense price competition resulted in a significant decline in our revenue during fiscal years and although we have seen slight improvements in some economic indicators within our markets  a generally weak domestic job market  global economic instabilities and the rather anemic domestic economic recovery continue to present a challenging environment for revenue growth 
as we cannot predict the pace or continuance of the domestic economic recovery or the impact of continued global economic instability  we continue to be focused on customer retention  expanding our growth targeted products and continuing to develop new market niches 
in addition  we have a proven history of managing our costs during tough economic times and wouldn t expect this to change in the future 
our apparel business challenges in our apparel segment  our market niche is highly competitive  commodity driven and is generally dominated by a limited number of players 
the downturn in the economy and turmoil in the credit markets in and created an over supply situation which further increased competitive pressures in this market 
while the economic environment has improved some  which led to increased demand for our product during the later part of fiscal year and the start of fiscal year  we have seen some recent softness in the market due to destocking strategies and current economic uncertainties both domestically and internationally 
whether the current softness in the market is just a temporary situation or one we will have to manage through for an extended period of time is unknown 
however  such uncertainty and volatility in the marketplace could have unanticipated adverse effects on our business beyond this past fiscal year 
in addition  the current spot price of cotton has contributed negatively to an already competitive marketplace and made it even more difficult for large manufacturers to maintain their margins given the high cost of cotton in their finished goods inventory 
while current spot prices on various input costs are down somewhat from comparable periods  most larger manufacturers costs in finished goods inventory are at considerably higher costs 
we  and other large manufacturers  have been and will continue to work though these higher input costs over the next several quarters before the current lower costs will have a positive impact on our operational results 
currently  pricing in the marketplace is not commensurate with the manufacturer s higher costs in their finished goods inventory 
the duration of this imbalance will be impacted by any continued softness in the market 
as such  our operating costs are subject to significant swings  which may or may not be passed on to the marketplace due to competitive or current economic conditions  competitors pricing strategies  etc 
thus  we believe we are facing the following challenges in our apparel segment business in fiscal cotton prices and market pricing new manufacturing facility continued economic uncertainties 
table of contents cotton prices cotton  which represents a significant portion of our cost  is a commodity product and subject to volatile fluctuations in price 
over the past several years we have seen cotton prices reach levels never before seen in its history and over the past months have seen the prices recede back to levels  while still high from a historical perspective  are significantly off the highs reached this past fiscal year 
whether or not prices will stay at current levels for a sustained period of time  or continue to recede  is unknown 
for the current quarter  our effective cost of cotton flowing into our operational results was higher than during the comparable period last year 
costs for cotton yarn and cotton based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton  which is affected by  among other factors  weather  consumer demand  commodities market speculation  currency fluctuations  international actions and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control 
we are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton 
however  our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices 
due to the high price of cotton during calendar year  alstyle  like most large manufacturers  was relatively short with respect to their cotton purchases entering calendar year however  during the middle part of the calendar year we locked in cotton contracts in order to guarantee an uninterrupted supply of cotton and price stability 
unfortunately  these locked in prices are significantly higher than the current spot price of cotton 
while we believe we are competitive with other large apparel manufacturers in the united states  with the current spot pricing in the market  many of the smaller manufacturers who do not have the financial capacity to enter into longer term contracts are now able to compete on a favorable basis due to their lower input cost 
as the costs incurred for materials are capitalized into inventory and impact a company s operating results as the inventory is sold  our peak cotton costs have been flowing into our operational results during the past several quarters 
we believe this is a situation that all large manufacturers like alstyle will need to continue to manage through over the next several quarters 
one way to manage through the higher material cost is to manage selling price to be consistent with these higher costs 
unfortunately  while the market has absorbed a certain level of price increase  it has never reached a level that would effectively offset the current level of cotton costs 
in addition  due to recent softness in the market  competitive pressures have started to have a negative impact on even these levels of market pricing 
some of our competitors have instituted stock restock programs and have announced price decreases  which have put further downward pressure on current market pricing 
these factors  along with domestic and international economic uncertainties  will make the next quarter or two extremely challenging to navigate through  and with margin compression expected until the current spot cotton pricing starts to flow through cost of sales 
new manufacturing facility the new manufacturing facility in agua prieta  mexico ap is fully operational and all production has now been transitioned from our anaheim  ca anaheim facility to the ap facility 
we began producing fabric from this facility during the first quarter of fiscal and current production levels are on target with our original estimates 
the negative impact associated with the start up ramp up of the new facility and the shut down of the anaheim facility was in line with our previous estimates of approximately to million to million impacting the current year s operational results 
the negative operational impact of this facility during the current quarter was minimal 
while the transition from anaheim to ap has been completed  much still needs to be accomplished  such as the installation of transitioned equipment and improving the operational efficiency factors  which we believe will continue to occur over the coming quarters as experience and production levels increase 
continued economic uncertainties as a result of the recessionary conditions of and  the economic climate has been and continues to be volatile and challenging both domestically and internationally 
decreased demand and intense price competition resulted in significant declines in revenues during fiscal year and although we saw an increase in our apparel revenues during fiscal year due to improving economic conditions we saw a significant fall off in our sales this fiscal year due to competitive pricing pressures which we attributed to a softness in the market 
international instability and continued domestic economic issues ie  high unemployment  housing sector weakness  etc 
have taken a toll on the domestic economic environment 
in addition  the decline in spot pricing of cotton has also given some retailers distributors screen printers reason to pause or be judicious with their replenishment orders 
as such  we saw some softness in the market this fiscal year 
whether these market conditions are temporary or ones we will have to manage through for sometime is unknown 
a prolonged softness in the market could have a negative impact on our revenues  operational results and lengthen the time it takes us to see through the higher cotton prices currently in our finished goods inventory 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the disclosures and reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to allowance for doubtful receivables  inventory valuations  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  pension plan obligations  accrued liabilities and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical due to their affect on our more significant estimates and judgments used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan for employees 
included in our financial results are pension costs that are measured using actuarial valuations 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual results 
as our pension assets are invested in marketable securities  fluctuations in market values could potentially impact our funding status and associated liability recorded 
amounts allocated to amortizable intangibles are determined based on valuation analysis for our acquisitions and are amortized over their expected useful lives 
we evaluate these amounts periodically at least once a year to determine whether a triggering event has occurred during the year that would indicate potential impairment 
we exercise judgment in evaluating our long lived assets for impairment 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets that include other intangible assets  goodwill  and property  plant  and equipment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in performing tests of impairment  we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the future 
actual results could differ from assumptions made by management 
at february   our goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately million and million  respectively 
no impairment charge was required for the year ended february  based on the results of our annual impairment test conducted as of november  the carrying value of invested capital for each reporting unit as compared to their fair value at november  was as follows goodwill reporting unit carrying value of invested capital fair value of invested capital apparel million million to million print million million to million trademarks tradenames reporting unit carrying value of invested capital fair value of invested capital apparel million million print million million we believe our businesses will generate sufficient undiscounted cash flow to more than recover the investments we have made in property  plant and equipment  as well as the goodwill and other intangibles recorded as a result of our acquisitions 
however  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairments or specific triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of products 
net sales consist of gross sales invoiced to customers  less certain related charges  including discounts  returns and other allowances 
returns  discounts and other allowances have historically been insignificant 
in some cases and upon customer request  we print and store custom print product for customer specified future delivery  generally within twelve months 
in this case  risk of loss from obsolescence passes to the customer  the customer is invoiced under normal credit terms and revenue is recognized when manufacturing is complete 
approximately million  million  and million of revenue were recognized under these agreements during fiscal years ended february   february   and february   respectively 

table of contents we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based upon historical collection trends  current economic factors  and the assessment of the collectability of specific accounts 
we evaluate the collectability of specific accounts using a combination of factors  including the age of the outstanding balances  evaluation of customers current and past financial condition and credit scores  recent payment history  current economic environment  discussions with our project managers  and discussions with the customers directly 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory values on hand  using specific aging categories  and write down inventory deemed obsolete and or slow moving based on historical usage and estimated future usage to its estimated market value 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of earnings 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
in addition to the above  we also have to make assessments as to the adequacy of our accrued liabilities  more specifically our liabilities recorded in connection with our workers compensation and health insurance  as these plans are self funded 
to help us in this evaluation process  we routinely get outside third party assessments of our potential liabilities under each plan 
in view of such uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on our forward looking statements since such statements speak only as of the date when made 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued further additional authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures 
the new guidance results in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   which will be the company s fiscal year beginning march  in june  the fasb issued an accounting standards update regarding the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements 
the provisions of this standard provide an option to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement of comprehensive income or as two separate but consecutive statements 
the company will be required to incorporate the provisions of this new standard effective with its first quarter filing for fiscal year in september  the fasb issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
after assessing qualitative factors  if an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  no further testing is necessary 
if an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  then the traditional two step goodwill impairment test must be performed 
the new guidance will be effective for annual goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   which will be the company s fiscal year beginning march  the company does not expect the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 

table of contents results of operations the discussion that follows provides information which we believe is relevant to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this analysis is presented in the following sections consolidated summary this section provides an overview of our consolidated results of operations for fiscal years  and segment operating results this section provides an analysis of our net sales  gross profit margin and operating income by segment 
consolidated summary fiscal years ended consolidated statements of earnings data net sales cost of goods sold gross profit margin selling  general and administrative gain from disposal of assets income from operations other expense  net earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings net sales 
our consolidated net sales decreased from million for the fiscal year ended february  to million for the fiscal year ended february   or a decrease of 
our sales decline for the year related primarily to the decline in our apparel sales which were off million  or due to softness in the market and continued pricing pressures 
net sales increased by million  or from million to for fiscal years ended february  and february   respectively 
the increase in our sales during fiscal year related to our apparel sales  which increased million  or due to improving economic conditions 
cost of goods sold 
our manufacturing costs decreased by million from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year  or our gross profit margin net sales less cost of goods sold decreased from for fiscal year to for fiscal year due to the decline in our apparel margin during the period which decreased from to from the comparable period last year 
the decline in our apparel margin was caused by higher input costs ie  mainly cotton and competitive pressures on selling prices 
our manufacturing costs for fiscal year increased by million from million for fiscal year to million  or while our sales increased by over that same period 
as a result our gross profit margin net sales less cost of goods sold improved basis points over the comparable period from for fiscal year to for fiscal year  through increased operational efficiencies due to increased unit sales  increased unit selling price  and product mix changes 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
for fiscal year  our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million  or from million  or of sales for fiscal year to million  or of sales for fiscal year the decrease in our selling  general and administrative expenses in addition to being volume related  was caused by a decrease in our bad debt expense  due to improved aging of our accounts receivable  and a reduction in our performance incentive costs for the year 
for fiscal year  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or from million  or of sales for fiscal year to million  or of sales for fiscal year the increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses was basically volume related  however  we did incur increases in our credit card fees due to increased customer usage as well as performance incentive costs during the year 
in addition  we had approximately million in one time credits during fiscal year which did not repeat in fiscal year 
table of contents gain from disposal of assets 
the gain from disposal of assets of  for fiscal year ended february  resulted from sale of vehicles and equipment 
the gain from disposal of assets of  for fiscal year ended february  resulted from sale of equipment 
income from operations 
our income from operations for fiscal year decreased million from operational earnings of million  or of sales for fiscal year  to operational earnings of million  or of sales for fiscal year the decrease in our operational earnings during fiscal year was primarily related to our decreased apparel sales and apparel gross profit margin 
our income from operations for fiscal year increased million from operational earnings of million  or of sales for fiscal year  to operational earnings of million  or of sales for fiscal year the increase in our operational earnings during fiscal year related primarily to our improved consolidated gross profit margin  offset by slightly higher selling  general and administrative costs 
other income and expense 
our interest expense was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our interest expense increased in fiscal year due mainly to the fact that we did not capitalize any interest related to our agua prieta facility as construction was completed 
during fiscal year  we capitalized interest expense relating to our agua prieta  mexico construction project of million compared to million for fiscal year provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rates for fiscal years  and were  and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year related to a reduction in the benefit associated with our domestic production activities deduction  which was caused by the moving of our apparel manufacturing from the united states to mexico 
our rate for fiscal year decreased over our rate for fiscal year due to an increase in our domestic production activities deduction credit 
net earnings 
due to the above factors  our net earnings decreased from million  or of sales for fiscal year to earnings of million  or of sales for fiscal year basic earnings per share decreased from earnings of per share for fiscal year to earnings of per share for fiscal year diluted earnings per share decreased from earnings of per share for fiscal year to earnings of per share for fiscal year our net earnings increased from million  or of sales for fiscal year to earnings of million  or of sales for fiscal year basic earnings per share increased from earnings of per share for fiscal year to earnings of per share for fiscal year diluted earnings per share increased from earnings of per share for fiscal year to earnings of per share for fiscal year the increase in net earnings during the period related primarily to our improved operational margin 
segment operating results fiscal years ended net sales by segment in thousands print apparel total print segment 
the print segment net sales represented   and of our consolidated net sales for fiscal years   and  respectively 
our print sales increased by million  or during the fiscal year while print sales declined million  or during fiscal year  when compared to the preceding fiscal year 
while our print sales continue to be challenged by technological and economic factors  we have seen revenue growth in this segment on both a sequential and comparative basis over the past several quarters 
while our growth has related principally to our acquisitions this fiscal year  we have seen stability in our underlying existing business 
the decline in our print sales in was primarily due to the continued economic recession from fiscal year in addition to the general impact of the economic recession on our sales  the adoption of digital technologies continues to erode revenues from our traditional print business 
the evolution to digital technology has been 
table of contents transpiring for some time now  and is expected to continue into the future 
the turbulent economy also led to weaker pricing in an already competitive industry as our customers sought cost savings to improve their own profitability in the light of declining sales 
apparel segment 
the apparel segment net sales represented   and of our consolidated net sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our fiscal year net sales for the apparel segment decreased by million  or over fiscal year  while our net sales increased by million  or over fiscal our apparel sales decreased in fiscal due to decreased unit sales resulting from the following soft market conditions  reduced retail and consumer sentiment attributed to the protracted and volatile economic recovery  the destocking of inventories at the retail distributor screen print levels  a drop in commodity prices and competitors pricing strategies 
the drop in commodity prices over the past months has caused some unrealistic expectations with respect to selling prices 
these unrealistic expectations caused some destocking of inventories during this time period  which added to the competitive pressures in the marketplace 
competitors motivated to maintain their capacity utilizations or to increase their market share  in an attempt to improve their inventory turns  instituted various rebate programs stock restock programs  etc 
or announced price decreases  all during a time when these same competitors were reflecting the high cotton costs in their cost of sales 
due to promotional pricing  products are being sold in the marketplace at prices less than their associated raw material costs 
since our pricing strategy has been to try to cover our costs  we feel this has negatively impacted our top line results over the past several quarters and may continue to impact our top line results for the next several quarters 
however  as the higher priced inventory in the marketplace are worked through  sales volumes should return to more normalized growth levels  pricing should stabilize as selling prices and the cost of cotton in inventories being consumed are in better alignment  and as such we would envision a better business environment during the second half of fiscal year during fiscal year  due to improving economic factors  we were able to increase our unit sales to new and existing customers by approximately and increase our average unit selling price by approximately 
fiscal years ended gross profit by segment in thousands print apparel total print segment 
our print gross profit margin margin  as a percent of sales  was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
in fiscal  our print margins rose slightly over the comparable period last year 
in fiscal  we saw our material prices rise  however  we were able to offset these price increases through selling price increases and operational improvements 
apparel segment 
our apparel margin  as a percent of sales  was  and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the cost of cotton  our largest input  increased over fiscal year due to economic slowness  and competitors production  inventory and market strategies  sale side pricing in the marketplace has not been consistent with the high level of cotton costs now flowing out of large manufacturers finished goods inventories and into cost of sales 
hence industry margins  as ours  have been compressed as of late due to these higher input costs and marketplace pressures 
in addition  our apparel margins have also been impacted by inefficiencies associated with the start up of our new manufacturing facility in agua prieta  mexico 
this has only had a minimal impact during the last couple of quarters and has been well within our projected levels 
we anticipate our apparel margins will continue to be challenged during next fiscal year as we manage our way through the remaining high priced cotton currently in our finished goods 
how long this will take  will be dependent upon how quickly we can turn our finished goods inventory which is dependent on many factors some of which are outside of our control 
we were able to increase our margin by basis points during fiscal year through an increase in our unit sales price and improved operational efficiencies which were able to offset our higher raw material costs 
during the previous fiscal year  spot cotton prices increased significantly  however  manufacturers were able to insulate themselves from some of these increases with forward purchase contracts 
however  because spot cotton prices remained at these levels for a sustained period of time  most of these favorable forward contracts expired during the first half of fiscal and were replaced with significantly higher cotton cost contracts 
as such  while we were able to offset these higher costs during fiscal  we were extremely concerned with the potential impact of these higher cotton costs entering into our fiscal year 

table of contents fiscal years ended profit by segment in thousands print apparel total less corporate expenses earnings before income taxes print segment 
as a percent of sales  our print segment s profits were   and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our print segment s profit for fiscal year increased slightly from million to million for fiscal years ended and  respectively 
our print segment s profit for both fiscal years and remained level at apparel segment 
as a percent of sales  our apparel segment s profits were   and 
the decrease in our apparel profits for fiscal are a result of the decrease in our apparel sales and margin as discussed previously 
the increase in our apparel profits during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year related primarily to our improved gross profit margins during this time period 
in addition to the significant improvement in our gross profits margins  we were able to continue cost cutting in selling  general  and administrative expenses following a review of our advertising and marketing activities during fiscal liquidity and capital resources fiscal years ended dollars in thousands working capital cash working capital 
our working capital increased by approximately million  or from million at february  to million at february  our current ratio  calculated by dividing our current assets by our current liabilities  increased from to at february  to to at february  the increase in both our working capital and current ratio related primarily to the increase in our apparel inventory  which is due to the higher cotton costs in our finished goods inventory and slightly lower unit turns due to decreased sales and an increase in our print inventory  which is associated with our print acquisitions during the year 
fiscal years ended dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows from operations during fiscal decreased by million over fiscal year  which had decreased by million over fiscal year the decrease in cash flows during fiscal resulted primarily from a decrease in our earnings and an increase of prepaid expenses  which was offset by a decrease in our accounts receivable and an increase in our pension liability the change in our cash flows for related primarily to the change in our inventory levels 
during fiscal year  we used cash to build our inventories by approximately million in anticipation of our move to agua prieta  whereas during fiscal year we generated approximately million in cash through reducing our inventory levels to help fund the construction of our new manufacturing facility 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash used for our investing activities increased by million  or from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year this increase was as a result of our two new print acquisitions million offset by the reduction in capital expenditures of approximately million which related to the construction of our new apparel manufacturing facility in agua prieta  mexico in fiscal for contractual commitments remaining in connection with the construction of this facility see the contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements section below 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities 
we used million less in cash associated with our financing activities in fiscal year when compared to the same period last year 
we borrowed million under our revolver during fiscal year to fund our print acquisitions  whereas we borrowed only million under our revolver during fiscal to build our apparel inventory in connection with the planned move of our apparel manufacturing facilities 
stock repurchase on october   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock through a stock repurchase program 
under the board approved repurchase program  share purchases may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions  share price  trading volume and other factors  and such purchases  if any will be made in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations 
these repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
while no shares have been purchased during the last two fiscal years  there have been a total of  shares of our common stock that have been purchased under the repurchase program since its inception at an average price per share of 
on april   the board authorized that an additional million be added to our stock repurchase program 
unrelated to the stock repurchase program  we purchased and shares of common stock during the fiscal years ended february  and february   respectively 
credit facility on february   we entered into the second amendment to second amended and restated credit agreement the facility with a group of lenders led by bank of america  na the lenders 
the facility provides us access to million in revolving credit  which we may increase to million in certain circumstances  and matures on august  the facility bears interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread ranging from to libor or at february  and at february   depending on our total funded debt to ebitda ratio  as defined 
as of february   we had million of borrowings under the revolving credit line and million outstanding under standby letters of credit arrangements  leaving us availability of approximately million 
the facility contains financial covenants  restrictions on capital expenditures  acquisitions  asset dispositions  and additional debt  as well as other customary covenants  such as total funded debt to ebitda ratio  as defined 
we are in compliance with all these covenants as of february  the facility is secured by substantially all of our domestic assets as well as all capital securities of each domestic subsidiary and of all capital securities of each direct foreign subsidiary 
we did not pay any additional amounts on the revolver for fiscal year it is anticipated that the available line of credit is sufficient to cover  should it be required  our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
on july   we entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement swap for a notional amount of million which matured on july  the swap effectively fixed the libor rate at 
we account for our derivatives as cash flow hedges and record them as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet  measure those instruments at fair value and recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change  unless the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge that offsets certain exposures  at which time the changes in fair value would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the swap was designated as a cash flow hedge  and the fair value at february  was million  million  net of deferred taxes 
the swap was reported on the consolidated balance sheet as of february  as current installments of long term debt with a related deferred charge recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
pension we are required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension plan 
these contributions are required under the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
we anticipate that we will contribute from million to million during fiscal we made contributions of million to our pension plan during each of our last fiscal years 
as our pension assets are invested in marketable securities  fluctuations in market values could potentially impact our funding status  associated liabilities recorded and future required minimum contributions 
at february   we had an unfunded pension liability recorded on our balance sheet of million 
the increase in our liability during the year related primarily to the decrease in the discount rate used to calculate our benefit obligations and to the performance of our pension assets 
inventories we believe our current inventory levels are sufficient to satisfy our customer demands and we anticipate having adequate sources of raw materials to meet future business requirements 
we have long term contracts in effect with paper and yarn suppliers that governs prices  but do not require minimum purchase commitments 
certain of our rebate programs do  however  require minimum purchase volumes 
management anticipates meeting the required volumes 

table of contents capital expenditures we expect our capital requirements for  exclusive of capital required for possible acquisitions will be in line with our historical levels of between million and million 
we expect to fund these expenditures through existing cash flows 
we expect to generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities to cover our operating and other normal capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements there have been no significant changes in our contractual obligations since february  that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
we had no off balance sheet arrangements in place as of february  the following table represents our contractual commitments as of february  in thousands 
total to debt revolving credit facility other contractual commitments estimated pension benefit payments letters of credit operating leases construction contract agua prieta total other contractual commitments total subsequent to february  and through may   we made no additional repayments on our revolving credit facility 
we expect future interest payments of million for each of the next four fiscal years through february   and million for fiscal year ending february   assuming interest rates and debt levels remain the same throughout the remaining term of the facility 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk on short term and long term financial instruments carrying variable interest rates 
we may from time to time utilize interest rate swaps to manage overall borrowing costs and reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
our variable rate financial instruments  including the outstanding credit facilities  totaled million at february  we had entered into a million interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge related to this debt  but this arrangement matured july   as such the entire balance of our line of credit is subject to fluctuations in the libor rate 
the impact on our results of operations of a one point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of the variable rate financial instruments as of february  would be approximately million 
foreign exchange we have global operations and thus make investments and enter into transactions in various foreign currencies 
the value of our consolidated assets and liabilities located outside the united states translated at period end exchange rates and income and expenses translated using average rates prevailing during the period  generally denominated in pesos and canadian dollars  are affected by the translation into our reporting currency the us dollar 
such translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
in future periods  foreign exchange rate fluctuations could have an increased impact on our reported results of operations
