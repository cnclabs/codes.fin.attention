overview we completed the largest acquisition in the company s history in june that coupled with continued strong demand for our wire and cable products contributed to increased revenues 
net income fell below prior year results primarily due to the expenses related to our acquisition of neptco as well as defined benefit pension settlement costs and continued plant transition expenses related to our randolph plant closing 
adjusting for these noted expenses  net income for the year exceeded prior year results

table of contents product lines throughout the year 
additionally  we incurred incremental one time expenses in the latter half of fiscal related to the transition of our webster  ma production processes over to the oxford  ma facility 
cost of products and services sold in our construction materials segment were  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal the increase in cost of products and services sold as a percentage of revenues in the construction materials segment during fiscal was primarily due to higher raw material costs which were partially offset by increased sales of our higher margin products and the resulting lower share of total sales that were made up of lower margin products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or to  during fiscal compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal compared to for fiscal the percentage decrease is attributable to our continued emphasis on controlling costs and leveraging fixed overhead 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  to  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal compared to for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower stock based compensation expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease was partially offset by increased research and development  sales commissions and other selling related expenses resulting from increased revenues in fiscal in fiscal  bad debt expense  net of recoveries  increased  or to  compared to  in fiscal the increase in bad debt expense in fiscal was primarily due to financial difficulties for some of our international customers as well as overall increased receivable balances due to higher sales

acquisition related costs in fiscal  we incurred  of acquisition costs related to our acquisition of neptco 
this acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with the appropriate accounting standards  as such all related professional service fees ie  banking  legal  accounting  actuarial  etc 
were expensed as they were incurred during the year ended august  in fiscal  we incurred  of acquisition costs related to our acquisitions of cim and serviwrap 
interest expense interest expense increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is a direct result of the  term note related to the acquisition of neptco 
interest expense decreased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the capitalization of imputed interest on construction in process projects related to our oxford  ma and blawnox  pa facilities 
other income other income decreased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal other income expense primarily includes interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses caused by changes in exchange rates on transactions or balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
in fiscal  other income includes a gain of  recognized on deposit payments previously received on the sale of our evanston  il property 
we took back control and ownership of this leased asset which was previously sold by us under a seller financing arrangement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in other income is partially offset by the foreign exchange losses caused by the continued weakening of both the sterling and euro 
other income increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in other income in fiscal from the prior year was primarily due to foreign exchange gains losses 
table of contents caused by the volatility of the pound sterling and the euro  and the subsequent revaluation of some of our european sales transactions completed in other functional currencies and subsequently translated to the pound sterling and the euro 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
in all three years  we have received the benefit of the domestic production deduction and foreign rate differential 
the increased effective tax rate in fiscal is primarily due to non deductible acquisition related expenses offset by a continued favorable effective state income tax rate 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal compares favorably to due to an increase in the applicable domestic production deduction for the year to increased from in fiscal and a more favorable effective state income tax rate in non controlling interest the income loss from non controlling interest relates to a joint venture in which we have  through our neptco subsidiary  a ownership stake 
the joint venture  between neptco and the joint venture partner an otherwise unrelated party  is managed and operated on a day to day basis by neptco 
the purpose of this joint venture was to combine the elements of each member s fiber optic strength businesses 
net income consolidated net income in fiscal decreased  or to  compared to  in fiscal the decrease in consolidated net income in fiscal was a result of the following factors a  in acquisition related expenses  b expenses of  in inventory fair value step up related to the neptco acquisition  and c acceleration of defined benefit plan settlement costs of  resulting from the timing of lump sum distributions to participants 
in addition  there was an increase in plant transition and moving expenses of  during fiscal consolidated net income in fiscal decreased  or to  compared to  in fiscal income from continuing operations increased  or to  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal the increase in net income from continuing operations in fiscal was a result of increased revenues offset by increased raw material costs 
income from discontinued operations of  for the year ended august  was from our chase ems business which was sold in june other important performance measures we believe that adjusted net income is a useful performance measure and is used by our executive management team and board of directors as a measure of operating performance  to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business  to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors and investors concerning our financial performance 
adjusted net income is a non gaap financial measure 
we define adjusted net income as follows net income attributable to chase corporation before costs related to our acquisitions  expenses related to inventory step up to fair value  and settlement gains or losses resulting from lump sum distributions to participants from our defined benefit plan 
our definition of adjusted net income includes the current tax expense benefit that would be payable realized on our income tax return 
the use of adjusted net income has limitations and this performance measure should not be considered in isolation from  or as an alternative to  us gaap measures such as net income 

table of contents the following unaudited table provides a reconciliation of net income attributable to chase corporation  the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with us gaap  to adjusted net income for the periods presented years ended august  net income attributable to chase corporation acquisition related costs a expense related to inventory step up b defined benefit plan settlement costs c tax effect of adjustments d total adustments adjusted net income a represents costs related to our june acquisition of neptco  september acquisition of cim and december acquisition of serviwrap b represents expenses related to the step up in fair value of inventory through purchase accounting from the june acquisition of neptco and september acquisition of cim c represents pension related settlement costs due to the timing of lump sum distributions d represents the theoretical current income tax associated with the adjustments presented above 
the theoretical current income tax was calculated by multiplying each adjustment  which relate to the jurisdictions where such items would provide tax expense benefit  by the applicable tax rates liquidity and sources of capital our overall cash balance increased  to  at august  from  at august  the increased cash balance at august  was a result of cash flows generated from operations during the fiscal year and  in cash acquired as part of the neptco acquisition  offset by principal payments on outstanding debt  equipment purchases  and payment of our annual dividend 
our overall cash balance decreased  to  at august  from  at august  the decreased cash balance at august  was a result of cash on hand used for strategic purchases of key raw materials  payment of our annual dividend in december  debt repayments and purchases of machinery and equipment including improvements made to our oxford  ma facility 
these cash outflows were partially offset by cash generated from operations during the fiscal year 
cash provided by operations was  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal cash provided by operations during fiscal was primarily due to operating income and decreased inventory as a result of higher sales volumes  offset by decreased accounts payable and increased accounts receivable balances 
cash provided by operations during fiscal was primarily due to operating income offset by increased purchases of inventory  as we strategically built up our inventory to facilitate certain manufacturing plant transition plans as well as making bulk purchases of key raw materials to take advantage of favorable pricing terms 
cash provided by operations during fiscal was primarily due to operating income and increased accounts payable and accrued expense balances  offset by increased accounts receivable and inventory balances 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was as of august  compared to as of august  the decrease in our current ratio at august  was primarily attributable to the increase in the current debt as a result of the neptco acquisition

as part of the financing for this acquisition  we retired all of our pre existing debt the term note and term loan noted above with bank of america and rbs citizens 
additionally  we obtained a new revolving line of credit the revolver totaling  which replaced our then existing  line 
the revolver bears interest at libor plus a range of to  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio  or  at our option  at the bank s base lending rate 
as of august  and october   the entire amount of  was available for use 
the revolver is scheduled to mature in june this revolver allows for increased flexibility for working capital requirements going forward  and we plan to use this availability to help finance our cash needs  including potential acquisitions  in fiscal and future periods 
the credit facility with bank of america contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
it also requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda each as defined in the facility of no more than to  and to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as calculated in the facility of at least to 
we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of august  we currently have several on going capital projects that are important to our long term strategic goals 
we continue to renovate our oxford  ma  and blawnox  pa facilities in anticipation of the relocation of our operations from randolph  ma 
we expect that this transition will be completed by december machinery and equipment will also be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in our other manufacturing plants 
we may consider the acquisition of companies or other assets this year or in future periods which are complementary to our business 
we believe that our existing resources  including cash on hand and our revolver  together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings  will be sufficient to fund our cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent that interest rates increase in future periods  we will assess the impact of these higher interest rates on the financial and cash flow projections of our potential acquisitions 
we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements

critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates the us securities and exchange commission sec requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results  and requires management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are described below 
accounts receivable we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific allowance against amounts due to us is recorded  and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  industry and geographic concentrations  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future  which could have an adverse impact on our future operating results 

table of contents inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand and changes in technology 
these assessments require management judgments and estimates  and valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory may be recorded based on these assessments 
we estimate excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand  product transitions  and market conditions and record reserves to reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
the failure to accurately forecast demand may lead to additional excess and obsolete inventory and future charges 
business combinations we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we assess the fair value of assets  including intangible assets  using a variety of methods and each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant 
the method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset  including a market participant s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant 
assets recorded from the perspective of a market participant that are determined to not have economic use for us are expensed immediately 
any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill 
transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a transaction to acquire a business are expensed as incurred 
goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets long lived assets consist of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  trademarks  patents and agreements and property  plant  and equipment 
intangible assets and property  plant  and equipment  excluding goodwill  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life 
we review long lived assets and all intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is also reviewed at least annually for impairment 
factors which we consider important and that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we determine whether an impairment has occurred based on gross expected future cash flows for each reporting unit and measure the amount of the impairment based on the related future discounted cash flows for the respective reporting unit 
the cash flow estimates used to determine impairment  if any  contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the estimates of expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance of our obligation is complete  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and we are reasonably assured of collecting 
this is typically at the time of shipment  or upon receipt by the customer 
if a loss is anticipated on any contract  a provision for the entire loss is made immediately 
revenue recognition involves judgments and assessments of expected returns  and the likelihood of nonpayment due to insolvent customers 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific customer contracts and shipment terms  historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 
commissions are recognized when earned and payments are received from the manufacturers represented 
royalty revenue is recognized based on licensee production statements received from the authorized manufacturers 
billed shipping and handling fees are recorded as sales revenue with the associated costs recorded as costs of products and services sold 

table of contents contingent income tax liabilities we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business 
our contingent income tax liabilities are estimated based on the methodology prescribed in the guidance for accounting for uncertain tax positions  which we adopted as of the beginning of fiscal the guidance prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities as well as by current income tax trends 
if circumstances change  we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our accounting for uncertain tax positions 
deferred income taxes we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for share based compensation at fair value  including estimated forfeitures  and recognize the expense over the period that the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which generally is the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options 
this model requires significant estimates related to the award s expected life and future stock price volatility of the underlying equity security 
in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  we are also required to estimate forfeiture rates for awards  based on the probability that employees will complete the required service period 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
pension benefits we sponsor a non contributory defined benefit pension plan covering employees of certain divisions of the company 
in calculating our retirement plan obligations and related expense  we make various assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions include discount rates  benefits earned  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors
