executive overview we are a sales  marketing and management company  primarily focused on the vacation ownership industry 
our business has historically been conducted through two operating segments our resorts business segment bluegreen resorts and our residential communities business segment bluegreen communities 
our continuing operations relate to bluegreen resorts 
bluegreen resorts markets  sells and manages vacation ownership interests vois in resorts  which are generally located in popular  high volume  drive to vacation destinations  and were either developed or acquired by us or developed by others  in which case we earn fees for providing these services 
vois in our resorts and those sold by us on behalf of third parties typically entitle the buyer to use resort accommodations through an annual or biennial allotment of points which represent their ownership and beneficial use rights in perpetuity in the bluegreen vacation club supported by an underlying deeded voi held in trust for the buyer 
owners in the bluegreen vacation club may stay in any of our resorts or take advantage of an exchange program offered by a third party world wide vacation ownership exchange network of over  resorts and other vacation experiences such as cruises and hotel stays 
bluegreen resorts also provides property and homeowners association management services  voi title services  mortgage servicing and resort amenity operational services 
in addition  bluegreen resorts provides financing to individual purchasers of vois  which provides significant interest income to us 
bluegreen communities  which  as discussed below  has been classified as a discontinued operation  markets residential homesites  the majority of which are sold directly to retail customers seeking to build a home generally in the future 
bluegreen communities also has realty and daily fee golf course operations 
bluegreen communities historical operations also included acquiring  developing and subdividing the property comprising its residential homesites 
during june  our board of directors made a determination to seek to sell bluegreen communities  or all or substantially all of its assets 
as a consequence  bluegreen communities is presented as a discontinued operation for all periods 
on october   a purchase and sale agreement was entered into between seven of our subsidiaries and southstar development partners  inc southstar 
the agreement  as amended  provides for the sale to southstar of substantially all of the assets that comprise bluegreen communities for a purchase price of million in cash 
southstar also agreed to pay an amount equal to of the net proceeds as calculated in accordance with the terms of the agreement it receives upon its sale  if any  of two specified parcels of real estate to be purchased by southstar under the agreement 
the agreement  as amended  provides for the transaction to be consummated on a date no later than april  however  closing of the transaction remains subject to the parties receipt of all required consents and certain other customary closing conditions  including the performance by the parties of their respective obligations under the agreement 
southstar has advised us that it has obtained financing in order to close the transaction  but obtaining such financing is not a closing condition 
there can be no assurance that the transaction will be consummated on the contemplated terms  including in the contemplated time frame  or at all 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
on november   we entered into a definitive merger agreement with bfc financial corporation bfc  pursuant to which  subject to the terms and conditions thereof  we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of bfc and our shareholders other than bfc will be entitled to receive eight shares of bfc s class a common stock for each share of our common stock that they hold at the effective time of the merger 
bfc owns approximately of our common stock as well as a controlling interest in bankatlantic bancorp  inc bankatlantic bancorp and a non controlling interest in benihana  inc benihana 
the merger agreement provides for the transaction to be consummated by june   subject to extension to a date no later than september  in the event the parties are proceeding in good faith with respect to the consummation of the merger 
however  consummation of the merger is subject to a number of closing conditions  including the approval of both our and bfc s shareholders  the listing of bfc s class a common stock on a national securities exchange at the effective time of the merger and the absence of any legal restraints or prohibitions preventing the completion of the merger or litigation or other proceeding seeking to enjoin or prohibit the merger 
there is no assurance that the merger will be consummated on the contemplated terms  including in the contemplated time frame  or at all 
following the announcement of our entry into the merger agreement  purported class action lawsuits seeking to enjoin the merger or  if it is completed  to recover relief as determined by the presiding court to be appropriate have been filed 
see item legal proceedings 
certain of our outstanding facilities with wells fargo and rfa  which had an aggregate outstanding balance of approximately million at december   require the prior consent of the lenders to the merger 
the wells fargo loan million outstanding as of december  is due the earlier of june  or the closing of the merger 
rfa has indicated that they intend to consent to the merger  and we are in the process of legal documentation on such consent 
if the merger is consummated  our common stock will no longer be listed for trading on the new york stock exchange the nyse or registered under the exchange act of the exchange act 
as described above  the merger agreement requires  as a condition to the merger  that bfc s class a common stock be approved for listing on a national securities exchange at the effective time of the merger 
during the year ended december  we generated free cash flow cash flow from operating and investing activities of million compared to million for we earned income from continuing operations of million compared to million for voi system wide sales  which include sales of third party inventory  were million compared to million during we sold million of third party inventory and earned sales and marketing commissions of million 
including our resort management  title services  construction management and other fee based operations  our total fee based service revenues were million  a increase over we believe our fee based service business enables us to leverage our expertise in resort management  sales and marketing  mortgage servicing  title services  and construction management to generate recurring revenues from third parties 
providing these services requires significantly less capital investment than our traditional vacation ownership business 
our goal is for fee based services to become an increasing portion of our business over time  however  our efforts to do so may not be successful 
during and  we sold million and million  respectively  of third party inventory and earned sales and marketing commissions of approximately million and million  respectively 
based on an allocation of our selling  marketing and field general and administrative expenses to these sales  we believe we generated approximately million and million in pre tax profits by providing sales and marketing fee based services during and  respectively 
additionally  consistent with initiatives seeking to improve our liquidity  during  we continued to focus on generating voi sales that are paid in cash in full at the time of sale or shortly thereafter and encouraging larger down payments on financed sales 
during  including down payments received on financed sales  of our voi sales were paid in cash within approximately days from the contract date 
refer to liquidity and capital resources section below for additional information 
seasonality we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our gross revenues and results of operations 
this seasonality may result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
although we typically see more potential customers at our sales offices during the quarters ending in june and september  ultimate recognition of the resulting sales during these periods may be delayed due to down payment requirements for recognition of real estate sales under gaap or due to the timing of development and the requirement that we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
notes receivable and allowance for loan losses we offer financing to buyers of our vois who meet certain minimum requirements 
on a more limited basis  bluegreen communities also offers financing to buyers of its homesites 
accordingly  we are subject to the risk of defaults by customers 
gaap requires that we reduce sales of vois by our estimate of future uncollectible note balances on originated voi notes receivables  excluding any benefit for the value of future recoveries of defaulted voi inventory 
we update our estimate of such future losses each quarter  and consequently  the charge against sales in a particular period may be impacted  favorably or unfavorably  by a change in our expected losses related to notes originated in prior periods 
we seek to monetize our notes receivable by transferring the notes to warehouse purchase facilities  in which case the notes are legally sold to a special purpose entity for the benefit of a financial institution or conduit  or by pledging the notes as collateral for a receivables hypothecation loan 
we attempt to maintain these diversified liquidity sources for our notes receivable in order to mitigate the risks of being dependent on a single source 
each such facility has eligibility standards for the notes receivable that may be sold or pledged under the facility 
it is generally contemplated that notes receivable transferred to a warehouse purchase facility will ultimately be included in a future securitization of the transferred notes 
the notes receivable securitized are determined during the negotiation of the securitization transaction  with the characteristics of the notes receivable selected determining the terms of the transaction 
notes receivable previously pledged as collateral for a receivable hypothecation loan may also be included in a term securitization transaction  however such notes are generally not included if doing so would result in a significant prepayment penalty 
further  based on the size and timing of the securitization  we may also choose to include newly originated notes receivable 
additionally  the specific characteristics of the notes receivable factor into whether such notes would be desirable to include in a securitization 
such factors may include delinquency status  fico score  interest rate  remaining term  outstanding balance and whether the obligor is foreign or domestic 
the allowance for loan losses as of december  and was as follows dollars in thousands as of december  december  notes receivable secured by vois voi notes receivable non securitized voi notes receivable securitized allowance for loan losses non securitized allowance for loan losses securitized voi notes receivable  net allowance as a of gross notes receivable notes receivable secured by homesites notes receivable allowance for loan losses homesite notes receivable  net allowance as a of gross notes receivable total notes receivable gross notes receivable allowance for loan losses notes receivable  net allowance as a of gross notes receivable the activity in our allowance for uncollectible notes receivable for the year ended december  was as follows in thousands balance  beginning of the year provision for loan losses less write offs of uncollectible receivables balance  end of year includes provision for loan losses on notes receivable generated in connection with the sales of homesites 
we believe that relatively high unemployment in the united states and adverse economic conditions in general have adversely impacted  and may continue to adversely impact  the performance of our notes receivable portfolio in the form of relatively higher defaults and lower prepayment rates than we have historically experienced 
our estimates regarding our allowance for loan losses involve interpretation of historical data  the aging of receivables  current default trends by origination year  the impact of loan seasoning  current economic conditions  the economic outlook  and the fico scores of the borrowers at the time of origination 
to the extent that our estimates change  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
during and  in addition to recognizing an estimate of loan losses on current loan originations  we recorded million and million  respectively  of charges as a result of changing our estimate of future loan losses on loans originated prior to our implementation of fico score based credit underwriting standards during december while we believe our notes receivable are adequately reserved at this time  future defaults may occur at levels greater than we expect 
if the future performance of our loans varies from our expectations and estimates  additional charges may be required in the future 
the average annual default rates and delinquency rates more than days past due on our notes receivable were as follows average annual default rates year ended december  division notes receivable secured by vois loans originated prior to december  loans originated on or after december  notes receivable secured by homesites delinquency rates as of december  division notes receivable secured by vois loans originated prior to december  loans originated on or after december  notes receivable secured by homesites on december   we implemented our fico score based credit underwriting program 
reflects  in management s opinion  the benefits of our fico score based credit underwriting standards as well as our policy that loans are not defaulted until after days past due 
the average annual default rate and the delinquency rate as of december  related to voi loans originated on or after december  may not reflect sufficient delinquency default experience of the underlying loans  and therefore  do not represent a meaningful comparison to the other periods presented 
as of december   we were in the process of foreclosing on a total of nine bluegreen communities receivables 
had we completed the foreclosure process in  the bluegreen communities average annual default rate would have been approximately and during and  respectively  and the delinquency rate would have been approximately as of december  the percentage of our serviced voi notes receivable portfolio that was over days past due as of the dates indicated 
substantially all defaulted voi notes receivable result in a recovery of the related voi that secured the note receivable  typically soon after default and a nominal cost 
we then attempt to resell the recovered voi in the normal course of business 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those that relate to the estimated future sales value of inventory  the recognition of revenue  including revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method of accounting  our reserve for loan losses  the recovery of the carrying value of real estate inventories  the fair value of assets measured at  or compared to  fair value on a non recurring basis such as assets held for sale  intangible assets and other long lived assets  and the estimate of contingent liabilities related to litigation and other claims and assessments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from management s estimates  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially  adversely impacted 
revenue recognition and inventory cost allocation 
sales of real estate in accordance with the requirements of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting codification standards acs  real estate revenue recognition  we recognize revenue on voi and homesite sales when a minimum of of the sales price has been received in cash buyer s commitment  the legal rescission period has expired  collectibility of the receivable representing the remainder of the sales price is reasonably assured and we have completed substantially all of our obligations with respect to any development related to the real estate sold 
we believe that we use a reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectibility of the receivables representing the remainder of the sales price of real estate sold 
see the further discussion of our policies regarding the estimation of credit losses on our notes receivable below 
should we become unable to reasonably estimate the collectibility of our receivables  we may have to defer the recognition of sales and our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
under timeshare accounting rules  the buyer s minimum cash down payment towards the purchase of our vois is met only if the cash down payment received  reduced by the value of certain incentives provided to the buyer at the time of sale  is at least of the sales price 
if  after consideration of the value of the incentive  the total down payment received from the buyer is less than of the sales price  the voi sale  and the related cost of sales and direct selling expenses  are deferred until such time that sufficient cash is received from the customer  generally through receipt of mortgage payments 
changes to the quantity  type or value of sales incentives that we provide to buyers of our vois may increase the number of voi sales being deferred or extend the period during which a sale is deferred  which could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
in cases where development has not been substantially completed  we recognize revenue in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
should our estimates of the total anticipated cost of completing projects increase  we may be required to defer a greater amount of revenue or may be required to defer revenue for a longer period of time  which could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
timeshare accounting rules require the use of an industry specific relative sales value method for relieving voi inventory and recording cost of sales 
under the relative sales value method  cost of sales is calculated as a percentage of net sales using a cost of sales percentage the ratio of total estimated development cost to total estimated voi revenue  including the estimated incremental revenue from the resale of repossessed voi inventory  generally as a result of the default of the related receivable 
the revenues of bluegreen communities  which include homesite sales  are included within the results of discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated statements of operations contained in this annual report 
fee based sales commissions and other operations revenue in addition to sales of real estate  we also generate revenue from the activities listed below 
the table provides a brief description of the applicable revenue recognition policy activity revenue is recognized when fee based sales commissions the sale transaction with the voi purchaser is consummated in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party developer and the related consumer rescission period has expired 
resort management and service fees management services are rendered 
resort title fees escrow amounts are released and title documents are completed 
rental and sampler program guests complete stays at the resorts 
rental and sampler program proceeds are classified as a reduction to cost of other resort operations 
in connection with our management of the property owners associations  among other things  we act as agent for the property owners association to operate the resort as provided under the management agreement 
in certain cases  the personnel at the resorts are bluegreen employees 
the property owners association bears all of the economic costs of such personnel and generally pays us in advance of  or simultaneously with  the payment of payroll 
in accordance with asc  overall considerations of reporting revenues gross as a principal versus net as an agent  reimbursements from the property owners associations relating to direct pass through costs are recorded net of the related expenses 
carrying value of voi completed inventory 
we carry our completed vois at the lower of i cost  including costs of improvements and amenities incurred subsequent to acquisition  capitalized interest  real estate taxes and other costs incurred during construction  or ii estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
carrying value of voi held for development and under development and long lived assets 
we evaluate the recovery of our long lived assets  and our undeveloped real estate properties or real estate properties under development  if certain trigger events occur 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
carrying value of assets held for sale 
the purchase and sale agreement with southstar described above provides for the sale of virtually all of the inventory and the fixed assets related to bluegreen communities 
therefore  such assets are presented separately on our consolidated balance sheets included in this annual report as assets held for sale 
the carrying value of assets held for sale is based on the fair value of the assets less estimated costs to sell 
the fair value of assets held for sale as of december  was derived from the sale price under the purchase and sale agreement with southstar 
during  we recorded non cash charges of million to write down the value of bluegreen communities assets to estimated fair value less costs to sell 
prior to bluegreen communities being classified as a discontinued operation  bluegreen communities inventory was accounted for based on its status of complete or undeveloped 
during and  we recorded non cash charges totaling million and million  respectively  to write down the carrying amount of certain phases of completed bluegreen communities properties to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
additionally  during  we recorded an impairment of million to write down the carrying amount of certain undeveloped phases of bluegreen communities properties to fair value  as we determined that the carrying amounts of these properties would not be recovered by estimated future cash flows 
our assessment consisted of determining recoverability of our costs based on our plans and upon a combination of factors  including  among others  estimates of remaining life of project sales for each project  the probability of alternative outcomes  the period required to complete such sales  estimates of costs to complete each project  if needed  and relevant market data 
allowance for loan losses on voi notes receivable 
we record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on our voi notes receivable as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize a timeshare sale 
we estimate uncollectible voi notes receivable based on historical uncollectibles for similar voi notes receivable over the applicable historical period  using a technique referred to as a static pool analysis  which tracks uncollectibles for each year s sales over the entire life of those notes 
we also consider certain qualitative data  including the aging of the respective receivables  current default trends by origination year  current economic conditions  and the fico scores of the borrowers 
additionally  under timeshare accounting requirements  no consideration is given for future recoveries of defaulted inventory in the estimate of uncollectible voi notes receivable 
we review our reserves for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis 
if defaults increase  our results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
during and  in addition to recognizing an estimate of loan losses on current loan originations  we recorded million and million  respectively  of charges as a result of changing our estimate of future loan losses on loans originated prior to our implementation of fico score based credit underwriting standards during december results of operations as described above and elsewhere in this annual report  the operating results of bluegreen communities  our residential communities business segment  have been classified as discontinued operations due to the decision made by our board of directors on june  to seek to sell the division or all or substantially all of its assets 
in connection with that determination  we incurred pre tax charges of million with respect to bluegreen communities assets based on our valuation of the assets held for sale 
additionally  during  our discontinued operations included a pre tax loss of million  which  when combined with the impairment charge and offset by the income tax benefit  resulted in an after tax loss from discontinued operations of million 
during  management modified its measure of segment operating profit to include certain costs previously excluded 
accordingly  the segment operating profit for bluegreen resorts for the years ended december  and has been adjusted to reflect the revised presentation 
information regarding the results of operations for bluegreen resorts for the years ended december   and is set forth below dollars in thousands for the year ended december  december  december  amount of system wide sales of vois  net amount of system wide sales of vois  net amount of system wide sales of vois  net system wide sales of vois changes in sales deferred under timeshare accounting rules system wide sales of vois  net less sales of third party vois gross sales of vois estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable sales of vois cost of vois sold gross profit fee based sales commission revenue other fee based services revenue cost of other fee based services net carrying cost of voi inventory selling and marketing expenses field general and administrative expenses operating profit includes sales of vois made on behalf of third parties  which are transacted in the same manner as the sale of our voi inventory 
percentages for estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable are calculated as a percentage of gross sales of vois 
percentages for cost of vois sold and gross profit are calculated based on sales of vois 
general and administrative expenses attributable to corporate overhead have been excluded from the table 
corporate general and administrative expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see corporate general and administrative expenses below for further discussion 
bluegreen resorts year ended december  compared to the year ended december  sales and marketing system wide sales of vois 
system wide sales of vois include sales of bluegreen owned vois as well as sales of vois owned by third parties 
the sales of third party vois are transacted as sales of timeshare interests in the bluegreen vacation club through the same selling and marketing process we use to sell our voi inventory 
we earn commissions on such sales from third parties 
system wide sales of vois increased from million in to million in as a result of an increase in the number of sales transactions and a slightly higher average sales price per transaction 
the following table sets forth certain information for sales of both bluegreen vois and voi sales made on behalf of third parties for a fee for the periods indicated 
the information is provided before giving effect to the deferral of bluegreen voi sales in accordance with gaap for the year ended number of sales offices at period end number of bluegreen voi sales transactions number of sales made on behalf of third parties for a fee total number of voi sales transactions average sales price per transaction number of total prospects tours sale to tour conversion ratio total prospects number of new prospects tours sale to tour conversion ratio new prospects percentage of sales to owners gross sales of vois 
gross sales of vois represent sales of bluegreen owned vois as adjusted by changes in sales deferred under timeshare accounting rules 
gross sales of vois were million and million in and  respectively 
sales of vois owned by us decreased during due to our increased focus on selling vois on behalf of third parties in connection with the expansion of our fee based service sales and marketing business 
see fee based sales commission revenue below 
gross sales of vois are impacted by the timing of when a sale meets the criteria for revenue recognition 
sales of bluegreen owned vois that do not meet the revenue recognition criteria as of the end of a period are deferred to a future period until such time as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
during  due to the timing of revenue recognition  we realized a net deferral of approximately million of sales  compared to a net recognition of approximately million of sales in sales of vois 
sales of vois represent gross sales of vois  as reduced by the impact of estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable as further described below 
sales of vois were million in compared to million in voi revenue is reduced by our estimate of future uncollectible voi notes receivable 
estimated losses for uncollectible voi notes receivable vary with the amount of financed sales during the period and changes in our estimates of future note receivable performance for newly originated loans and the future performance of our existing loan portfolio 
our estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable as a percentage of gross sales of vois were and during and  respectively 
our estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable as a percentage of gross sales of vois were higher during due to the charges recognized during the year in connection with changes in our estimate of future performance on loans generated prior to december  as further described below 
in connection with our quarterly analysis of our loan portfolio  which consists of evaluating the expected future performance of loans with remaining lives of one to ten years  we may identify factors or trends that change our estimate of future loan performance and result in a change in our allowance for loan losses 
during the years ended december  and  we reduced revenue by million and million  respectively  for the estimated future uncollectibles on loans originated in these periods 
additionally  during  and to a lesser extent during  we recorded charges to increase our allowance for uncollectible notes receivable in connection with the lower fico score loans generated prior to december   the date on which we implemented fico score based credit standards 
in connection with our quarterly analysis of loan performance  we concluded that these lower fico score loans have not experienced the same benefit of seasoning as other loans in the same vintage historically have  thus increasing the probability of higher future defaults on such loans  which resulted in charges of million and million during and  respectively 
while we believe our notes receivable are adequately reserved at this time  actual defaults may differ from our estimates 
cost of vois sold 
cost of vois sold is the cost of bluegreen vois sold during the period and relieved from inventory 
during and  cost of vois sold was million and million  respectively  and represented and  respectively  of sales of vois 
cost of vois sold as a percentage of sales of vois varies between periods based on the relative costs of the specific vois sold in each period  changes in the estimated future sales including future defaults and estimated incremental revenue from the resale of repossessed voi inventory  and the size of the point packages of the vois sold due to offered volume discounts  including consideration of cumulative sales to existing owners 
fee based sales commission revenue 
we earn commissions for the sales of third party inventory upon the closing of the respective sales transaction 
during the years ended december  and  we sold million and million  respectively  of third party inventory and earned sales and marketing commissions of million and million  respectively 
based on an allocation of our selling  marketing and segment general and administrative expenses to these sales  we believe we generated approximately million and million in pre tax profits from these sales and marketing fee based services during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the sales of third party developer inventory during is a result of our strategic expansion of our fee based service business 
we anticipate that fee based services will be a greater portion of our revenues in the future  although our efforts in this respect may not be successful 
net carrying cost of voi inventory 
we are responsible for paying maintenance fees and developer subsidies for unsold bluegreen voi inventory  which is paid to the property owners associations that maintain the resorts 
we attempt to mitigate this expense  to the extent possible  through the rental of our owned vois 
accordingly  the net carrying cost for our unsold inventory fluctuates with the number of vois we own and the number of resorts subject to the developer subsidy arrangements  as well as proceeds from rental and sampler activity 
during and  the carrying cost of our inventory was million and million  respectively  and was partly offset by rental and sampler revenues  net of expenses  of million and million  respectively 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses were million and million during and  respectively 
as a percentage of system wide sales  net  selling and marketing expenses remained relatively consistent during the years at in and in our overall sale to tour ratios decreased slightly during to  compared to in sales to owners  which carry a relatively lower marketing cost  accounted for of system wide sales during  as compared to during field general and administrative expenses 
field general and administrative expenses  which represent expenses directly attributable to our resort sales and marking operations and exclude corporate overhead  were million and million during and  respectively 
as a percentage of system wide sales  net  field general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to during from during other fee based services revenue and costs related to our other fee based services were as follows in thousands for the year ended revenues fee based management services title operations other total other fee based services revenue costs fee based management services title operations other total cost of other fee based services profit fee based management services title operations other total other fee based services profit other fee based services revenue 
our other fee based services revenue consists primarily of fees earned for providing management services and fees earned for providing title services for voi transactions 
we provide management services to the bluegreen vacation club and to a majority of the property owners associations of the club resorts and club associate resorts 
in connection with our management services provided to the bluegreen vacation club  we manage the club reservation system  provide owner services  and perform billing and collections services 
revenues generated by other fee based services were million and million during and  respectively 
revenues related to other fee based services increased in as we provided services to more voi owners and managed more timeshare resorts on behalf of property owners associations 
as of december   we managed timeshare resort properties and hotels compared to as of december  the increase in management services revenue was partly offset by a reduction in fees earned from title services during  as a result of an initiative implemented during which reduced our processing back log and had an impact of increasing title fee revenues 
we intend to continue to pursue our efforts to provide resort management and title services to resort developers and others  on a cash fee basis 
while our efforts to do so may not be successful  we hope that this will become an increasing portion of our business over time 
cost of other fee based services 
cost of other fee based services was million and million in and  respectively 
this increase in the cost during was due to the additional service volume described above 
bluegreen resorts year ended december  compared to the year ended december  sales and marketing system wide sales of vois 
system wide sales of vois include sales of bluegreen owned vois as well as sales of vois owned by third parties 
we began selling and marketing vacation ownership inventory on behalf of third parties for a fee in july the sales on behalf of third parties are transacted through the same selling and marketing process we use to sell our owned voi inventory 
the following table sets forth certain information for sales of both bluegreen vois and voi sales made on behalf of third parties for a fee for the periods indicated 
the information is provided before giving effect to the deferral of sales in accordance with gaap for the year ended number of sales offices at period end number of bluegreen voi sales transactions number of sales made on behalf of third parties for a fee total number of voi sales transactions average sales price per transaction number of total prospects tours sale to tour conversion ratio total prospects number of new prospects tours sale to tour conversion ratio new prospects percentage of sales to owners gross sales of vois 
gross sales of vois represent sales of bluegreen owned vois as adjusted by changes in sales deferred under timeshare accounting rules 
gross sales of vois were million and million in and  respectively 
gross sales of vois are impacted by the timing of when a sale meets the criteria for revenue recognition 
sales of bluegreen owned vois that do not meet the revenue recognition criteria as of the end of a period are deferred to a future period until such time as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
during  due to the timing of revenue recognition  we realized a net recognition of approximately million of sales  compared to a net recognition of approximately million of sales in sales of vois 
sales of vois represent gross sales of vois  reduced by our estimate of future uncollectible voi notes receivable 
sales of vois were million in compared to million in estimated losses for uncollectible voi notes receivable vary with the amount of financed sales during the period  and changes in our estimates of future note receivable performance for newly originated loans and the future performance of our existing loan portfolio 
during the years ended december  and  we reduced revenue by million and million  respectively  for the estimated future uncollectibles on loans originated in these periods 
additionally  during  we recorded charges of million to increase our allowance for uncollectible notes receivable in connection with the lower fico score loans generated prior to december   the date on which we implemented fico score based credit standards 
in connection with our analysis of loan performance which we performed during  we concluded that these lower fico score loans have not experienced the same benefit of seasoning as other loans in the same vintage historically have  thus resulting in the probability of higher future defaults on such loans 
cost of vois sold 
cost of vois sold was million and million in and  respectively 
cost of vois sold varies between periods based on the sales volumes  the relative costs of the specific vois sold in each respective period and the size of the point packages of the vois sold 
additionally  cost of vois sold during was impacted by the decrease in the overall carrying cost of our voi inventory due to the adoption of asu and asu  effective january  in addition  the increase in our loan loss reserve during impacted our future projected product margins  which decreased the carrying cost of inventory in accordance with applicable timeshare accounting rules 
during the year ended december   bluegreen resorts gross profit percentage was  compared to during the year ended december  the increase in the gross profit percentages during is mainly attributed to the decrease in the carrying cost of our voi inventory as a result of the adoption of the new accounting standards on january   as described above 
fee based sales commission revenue 
as described above  in july  we began selling and marketing vois owned by third parties for a fee 
we earn commissions for the sales of third party vois upon the closing of the respective sales transaction 
during the years ended december  and  we sold million and million  respectively  of third party vois and earned sales and marketing commissions of million and million  respectively 
based on an allocation of our selling  marketing and segment general and administrative expenses to these sales  we believe we generated approximately million and million in pre tax profits by providing these sales and marketing fee based services during the years ended december  and  respectively 
net carrying cost of voi inventory 
the carrying cost of our voi inventory includes maintenance fees and developer subsidies on vois in bluegreen owned inventory that are paid to the property owners associations that maintain the resorts 
we partially mitigate this expense  to the extent possible  through the rental of our owned vois 
accordingly  the net carrying cost of developer inventory fluctuates with the number of vois we hold and the number of resorts subject to developer subsidy arrangements  as well as revenue realized from rental and sampler activity 
during and  the carrying cost of our developer inventory totaled approximately million and million  respectively  and was offset by rental and sampler revenues  net of expenses  of million and million  respectively

our other fee based services revenue consists primarily of fees earned for providing management services and fees earned for providing title services for voi transactions 
in exchange for fees  we provide management services to the bluegreen vacation club and to a majority of the property owners associations of the club resorts and club associate resorts 
in connection with our management services provided to bluegreen vacation club  we manage the club reservation system and provide owner services as well as billing and collections services 
revenues generated by other fee based services were million and million during and  respectively 
revenues related to other fee based services increased in as a result of additional fees earned by providing services to more voi owners and from managing more timeshare resorts on behalf of property owners associations 
as of december   we managed timeshare resort properties and hotels compared to as of december  additionally  our revenues related to title services increased due to a reduction in our processing back log and the increase in the number of system wide voi sales transactions

the decrease in interest income during compared to was a result of the continued decrease in our voi notes receivable portfolio  which in turn was due to both the maturing of the portfolio as well as our efforts to increase cash sales and collect higher down payments on those voi sales that we do finance 
we expect that our notes receivable portfolio will continue to decrease in the near term due to these factors 
the increase in total interest income on notes receivable during as compared to reflects a higher average balance of our vacation ownership notes receivable and to a lesser extent  higher interest rates charged on timeshare loans originated on or after november  as discussed above  the average balances of our notes receivable increased during as a result of the consolidation of notes receivable held by seven of our special purpose finance entities that were previously reported off balance sheet 
accordingly  we previously did not recognize interest income on such notes receivable  but instead recognized interest income through the accretion of interest on our retained interests in the notes held by these entities 
as of january   the amount of receivables  net of allowance  that would have been previously reported off balance sheet was million 
interest expense

mortgage servicing operations 
our mortgage servicing operations include processing payments and collection of notes receivable owned by us and by third parties 
in addition  our mortgage servicing operations facilitate the monetization of our voi notes receivable through our various credit facilities and include monthly reporting activities for our lenders and receivable investors 
we earn loan servicing fees from securitization and securitization type transactions as well as from providing loan servicing to third party developers 
prior to the adoption of asu and asu on january   we recognized servicing fee income for providing mortgage servicing for notes receivable that had been sold to off balance sheet special purpose finance entities and for providing loan services to third party portfolio owners on a cash fee basis 
beginning in  we ceased recognizing servicing fee income for providing mortgage servicing to our special purpose finance entities as such entities are now consolidated by us and the related loan servicing fees are now reported as a component of interest income 
in  we began earning servicing fee income for servicing the loan portfolios of certain third party developers in connection with our fee based service arrangements 
such servicing fee income was approximately million and million during and  respectively 
as of december   the total principal amount of notes receivable serviced by us under these arrangements was million

our provision for income taxes in includes a one time benefit of approximately million for an adjustment to deferred income taxes in the second quarter of  a result of certain temporary book and tax differences being deemed permanent see note to the consolidated financial statements

on june   our board of directors made a determination to seek to sell bluegreen communities  or all or substantially all of its assets 
as a result of this decision  it was determined that bluegreen communities met the criteria for classification as discontinued operations 
accordingly  the operating results of bluegreen communities  which prior to june  were presented as a separate reporting segment  are included in discontinued operations for all periods in our consolidated statements of operations

while fair value was derived from the sale price under the purchase and sale agreement described above  the transaction may not be consummated on the contemplated terms or at all

cost of discontinued operations was million and million during and  respectively 
cost of discontinued operations during and included non cash impairment charges to write down certain phases of our properties to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
as a result of continued depressed sales volume  reduced prices and the impact of sales levels on the forecasted sell out period of projects  during the years ended december  and  we recorded non cash charges to cost of real estate sales of approximately million and million  respectively  to write down the carrying amount of certain phases of bluegreen communities properties to their estimated fair value  less costs to sell  if applicable 
we calculated the estimated fair value less costs to sell of these properties as of december  and based on our analysis of their estimated future cash flows  discounted at rates commensurate with the inherent risk 
we estimated future cash flows based upon what we believed to be market participants expectations of future performance  given then current and projected forecasts of the economy and real estate markets in general as well as the forecasted sell out periods for each community 
as of december   we evaluated the carrying value of bluegreen communities inventory carrying value was million as of december  based upon the probability weighted average cash flows at various outcomes  including to develop and sell such inventory as retail homesites or to execute on various strategic alternatives which we contemplated pursuing at that time 
during the fourth quarter of  bluegreen communities sold four of its golf courses located in north carolina and virginia for cash proceeds of approximately million  and we realized a loss on the sale of the golf courses of million

changes in financial condition the following table summarizes our cash flows for  and in thousands for the year ended december  cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by used in investing activities cash flows used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities 
we generated million of cash from our operating activities during  as compared to million of cash generated during and million of cash generated during our operating cash flow increased during due to the generation of more cash from voi sales and fee based services  and a reduction of our inventory development spending  partly offset by lower interest income on notes receivable due to the decreasing balance of the portfolio 
the increase in cash flows from operating activities during as compared to was primarily a result of our consolidation of assets  liabilities  and operations of special purpose finance entities upon our adoption of asu and asu on january   which resulted in changes to our cash flow statement in the form of additional cash receipts from securitized notes receivable now being included in operating cash flows see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
previously  these special purpose finance entities were not consolidated and the net cash flow associated with their operations which consist of collecting principal and interest payments on notes receivable and making interest and debt repayments was recorded as a component of investing activities as cash received from retained interests 
the increase in cash flows from operating activities during compared to was also the result of significantly lower development spending  our successful efforts to receive larger down payments on our sales and generate a higher percentage of cash voi sales  and increased revenues related to our fee based services  substantially all of which are provided on a cash basis 
cash flows from investing activities 
we used million of cash in our investing activities during  as compared to million of cash used during and million of cash generated during expenditures in and consisted primarily of spending on information technology needed to enhance or maintain operations 
cash used by our investing activities during also included million for the acquisition of the paradise point resort 
the decrease in cash flows from investing activities during as compared to was primarily the result of the required reclassification of cash received from retained interests in notes receivable sold as a result of the adoption of the new accounting guidance as discussed above in cash flows from operating activities compared to amounts received in additionally  during  we reduced our spending for property and equipment to million  as compared to million in  and we realized million of cash from the sale of golf courses in cash flows from financing activities 
we used million of cash in our financing activities during  as compared to million of cash used during and million of cash used during the decrease in cash used in financing activities during reflects lower payments required to service our lines of credit and notes payable  as well as lower distributions to the non controlling interest in the joint venture 
the increase in cash used in financing activities during as compared to was related to net repayments ie  repayments net of borrowings of million related to our debt collateralized by notes receivable during  compared to net repayments of million during the securitization debt is repaid as mortgage payments are received on the notes receivable that serve as collateral for the debt 
the net repayments of notes receivable backed debt in reflect the consolidation of securitization debt as a result of adopting asu and asu effective january  additionally  we entered into two securitization transactions during pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds of million  of which was used to pay down our receivables purchase facility with bb t 
in addition  we repaid million under our lines of credit and notes payable during  compared to net repayments of million during for additional information on the availability of cash from our existing credit facilities as well as our repayment obligations  see liquidity and capital resources below 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds from internal operations are i cash sales  ii down payments on voi sales which are financed  iii proceeds from the sale of  or borrowings collateralized by  notes receivable  including cash received from our residual interests in such transactions  iv cash from our finance operations  including mortgage servicing fees and principal and interest payments received on the purchase money mortgage loans arising from sales of vois  and v net cash generated from our sales and marketing fee based services and other resort fee based services  including our resorts management operations 
during  including down payments received on financed sales  of our voi sales were paid in cash within approximately days from the contract date 
we believe that the amount of cash received within days is a result of i incentives paid to our sales associates for generating cash sales volume  and ii point of sale credit card programs provided by third parties for our customers 
should such programs change or be eliminated  our percentage of cash sales could decrease significantly 
while the vacation ownership business has historically been capital intensive  our principal goal in the current environment has been to emphasize the generation of free cash flow defined as cash flow from operating and investing activities by i incentivizing our sales associates and creating programs with third party credit card companies to generate higher percentages of our sales in cash compared to historical levels  as discussed above  ii maintaining sales volumes that allow us to focus on what we believe to be the most efficient marketing channels available to us  iii minimizing capital and inventory expenditures  and iv utilizing our sales and marketing  mortgage servicing  resort management services  title and construction expertise to pursue fee based service business relationships that require minimal up front capital investment and have the potential to produce strong cash flows for us 
historically  our business model has depended on the availability of credit in the commercial markets 
voi sales are generally dependent upon us providing financing to our buyers 
our ability to sell and or borrow against our notes receivable from voi buyers has been a critical factor in our continued liquidity 
when we sell vois  a financed buyer is only required to pay a minimum of to of the purchase price in cash at the time of sale  however  selling  marketing  and administrative expenses attributable to the sale are primarily cash expenses that generally exceed the buyer s minimum required down payment 
accordingly  having financing facilities available for the hypothecation  sale  or transfer of these voi receivables has been a critical factor in our ability to meet our short and long term cash needs 
we have attempted to diversify our sources of such financing facilities 
historically  we have relied on our ability to sell receivables in the term securitization market in order to generate liquidity and create capacity in our receivable facilities 
in addition  maintaining adequate voi inventory to sell and pursue growth into new markets has historically required us to incur debt for the acquisition  construction and development of new resorts 
we believe that in general we currently have adequate completed vois in inventory to satisfy our needs for the next several years  although we expect to develop vois at our bluegreen big cedar joint venture in the near term 
accordingly  except for development at the bluegreen big cedar joint venture  we expect acquisition and development expenditures to remain at current levels in the near term 
furthermore  if the opportunity to acquire a strategic property on favorable terms presents itself  we may decide to acquire or develop more inventory in the future which would increase our acquisition and development expenditures and may require us to incur additional debt 
we currently expect development expenditures during to be in a range of approximately million to million  with the majority of spending related to the bluegreen big cedar joint venture 
we may seek to raise additional debt or equity financing in the future to fund operations or repay outstanding debt  however  such financing may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
if our efforts are unsuccessful  our liquidity would be significantly adversely impacted 
in light of the current trading price of our common stock  financing involving the issuance of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders 
our levels of debt and debt service requirements have several important effects on our operations  including the following i our significant debt service cash requirements reduce the funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increases our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  as well as conditions in the credit markets  generally  ii our leverage position increases our vulnerability to economic and competitive pressures  iii the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in indentures  credit agreements and other agreements relating to our indebtedness require us to meet certain financial tests and restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow additional funds  dispose of assets or make investments  and iv our leverage position may limit funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
in addition  certain of our financing arrangements restrict our ability in the near term to pay cash dividends on our common stock and repurchase shares 
certain of our competitors operate on a less leveraged basis and have greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
certain of the assets contemplated to be sold under the purchase and sale agreement with southstar serve as collateral for our outstanding hbg communities facility  which had an aggregate outstanding balance of approximately million at december  under the terms of the facility  the entire amount of such debt and a million deferred fee would be required to be repaid in connection with the sale of the assets  including upon consummation of the sales transaction with southstar 
in addition  certain of our outstanding facilities with wells fargo and rfa  which had an aggregate outstanding balance of approximately million at december   require the prior consent of the lenders to our proposed merger with bfc 
the wells fargo loan million outstanding as of december  is due the earlier of june  or the closing of the merger

commitments our material commitments as of december  included the required payments due on our receivable backed debt  lines of credit and other notes payable  commitments to complete our projects based on our sales contracts with customers and commitments under non cancelable operating leases 
the following table summarizes the contractual minimum principal and interest payments  net of unamortized discount  required on all of our outstanding debt including our receivable backed debt  lines of credit and other notes and debentures payable and our non cancelable operating leases by period date  as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than year years years after years total contractual obligations receivable backed notes payable lines of credit and notes payable jr 
subordinated debentures noncancelable operating leases total contractual obligations interest obligations receivable backed notes payable lines of credit and notes payable jr 
subordinated debentures total contractual interest total contractual obligations legacy securitization payments included in the receivable backed notes payable after years are presented net of a discount of million 
assumes that the scheduled minimum principal payments are made in accordance with the table above and the interest rate on variable rate debt remains the same as the rate at december  we estimate that the cash required to satisfy our development obligations related to resort buildings and resort amenities is approximately million as of december  we also estimate that the cash required to satisfy our obligations related to bluegreen communities projects that were substantially sold out and as a result are not part of the sale to southstar  is approximately million as of december  we plan to fund these expenditures over the next three to five years  primarily with cash generated from operations  however  we may not be able to generate the cash from operations necessary to complete these commitments and actual costs may exceed the amounts estimated 
each of the foregoing estimates assumes that we are not obligated to develop any building  project or amenity in which a commitment has not been made pursuant to a sales contract with a customer or other obligations  however  we anticipate that we will incur such obligations in the future 
we believe that our existing cash  anticipated cash generated from operations  anticipated future permitted borrowings under existing or proposed credit facilities and anticipated future sales of notes receivable under the purchase facilities and one or more replacement facilities we will seek to put in place will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements  including the contractual payment of the obligations set forth above  for the foreseeable future  subject to the successful implementation of ongoing strategic initiatives and the ongoing availability of credit 
we will continue our efforts to renew  extend or replace any credit and receivables purchase facilities that have expired or that will expire or  in certain circumstances  accelerate in the near term 
we may  in the future  also obtain additional credit facilities and may issue corporate debt or equity securities 
any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured or unsecured  bear interest at fixed or variable rates and may be subject to such terms as the lender may require 
in addition  our efforts to renew or replace the credit facilities or receivables purchase facilities which have expired or which are scheduled to expire in the near term may not be successful  and sufficient funds may not be available from operations or under existing  proposed or future revolving credit or other borrowing arrangements or receivables purchase facilities to meet our cash needs  including our debt service obligations 
to the extent we are not able to sell notes receivable or borrow under such facilities  our ability to satisfy our obligations would be materially adversely affected 
our credit facilities  indentures  and other outstanding debt instruments  and receivables purchase facilities include what we believe to be customary conditions to funding  eligibility requirements for collateral  cross default and other acceleration provisions  certain financial and other affirmative and negative covenants  including  among others  limits on the incurrence of indebtedness  the repurchase of securities  payment of dividends  investments in joint ventures and other restricted payments  the incurrence of liens  and transactions with affiliates  as well as covenants concerning net worth  fixed charge coverage requirements  debt to equity ratios  portfolio performance requirements  cash balances and events of default or termination 
in the future  we may be required to seek waivers of such covenants  and we may not be successful in obtaining waivers  and such covenants may limit our ability to raise funds  sell receivables  satisfy or refinance our obligations or otherwise adversely affect our operations 
further  certain of our outstanding debt includes covenants which restrict our ability to pay cash dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock 
in addition  our future operating performance and ability to meet our financial obligations will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which may be beyond our control 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inflation and changing prices risk we believe that inflation and changing prices have had a material impact on our revenues and results of operations 
we have increased the sales prices of our vois periodically and have experienced increased construction and development costs from time to time during the last several years 
we may not be able to increase or maintain the current level of our sales prices  and increased construction costs may have a material adverse impact on our gross margin 
in addition  to the extent that inflation in general or increased prices for our vois adversely impacts consumer demand  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
foreign currency risk during  our total revenues and net assets denominated in a currency other than us dollars represented approximately of our consolidated revenues and less than of our consolidated assets 
sales generated by bluegreen properties  nv  our subsidiary in aruba  are transacted in us dollars 
the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates have not historically been significant to our operations or net assets 
interest rate risk as of december   we had fixed interest rate debt of approximately million and floating interest rate debt of approximately million 
in addition  our notes receivable were comprised of million of fixed rate loans and million of notes bearing floating interest rates 
the floating interest rates are based either upon the prevailing prime or libor rates 
for floating rate financial instruments  interest rate changes do not generally affect the market value of the debt  but they do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
conversely  for fixed rate financial instruments  interest rate changes affect the market value of the debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
to the extent inflationary trends  tightened credit markets or other factors affect interest rates  our debt service costs may increase 
if interest rates increased or decreased one percentage point  the effect on interest expense related to our variable rate debt would be an annual increase or a decrease of approximately million  based on december  balances 
a similar change in interest rates would affect the total fair value of our fixed rate debt by an immaterial amount 
this analysis does not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could result due to interest rate changes 
further  in the event of a significant change in interest rates  we would likely attempt to take actions to mitigate any exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the foregoing sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure
