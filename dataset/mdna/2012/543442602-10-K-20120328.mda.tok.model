table of contents overview looksmart is a search advertising network solutions company that provides relevant solutions for search advertising customers 
looksmart was organized in and is incorporated in the state of delaware 
looksmart operates in a large online search advertising ecosystem serving ads that target user queries on partner sites 
we operate in the middle of this ecosystem  acquiring search queries from a variety of sources and matching them with the keywords of our search advertising customers 
our largest category of customers has historically been intermediaries  the majority of which purchase clicks to sell into the affiliate networks of the large search engine providers 
another category of customers are direct advertisers and their agencies whose objective is to obtain conversions or sales from the clicks  while others want unique page views 
the last category of customers is self service advertisers that sign up online and pay by credit card 
in  revenue from intermediaries decreased significantly compared to the decrease was primary driven by a revenue decrease throughout the year  including a significant decrease in the fourth quarter due to revenue chargebacks to our intermediary customers by large search engine providers 
this had a severe impact to intermediary business models and consequently the business they conduct with us 
we have ceased business with several intermediaries as a result and we do not expect significant future growth in intermediary business 
our future growth will come largely from direct advertisers  self service advertisers and other digital advertising models we may consider 
looksmart offers search advertising customers targeted search via a monitored search advertising distribution network using the company s adcenter platform technology 
the company s search advertising network includes publishers and search advertising customers  including intermediaries and direct advertising customers and their agencies as well as self service customers in the united states and certain other countries 
the company s application programming interface api allows search advertising customers and their advertising agencies to connect any type of marketing or reporting software with minimal effort  for easier access  management  and optimization of search advertising campaigns 
looksmart also offers publishers licensed private label search advertiser network solutions based on its adcenter platform technology publisher solutions

in the first quarter of  management made the decision to exit its remaining consumer products activities and to sell or otherwise dispose of the company s remaining consumer assets 
the results of operations of consumer product activities  including related gains losses  have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements below 
at december   the company continues to own the wisenut search engine technology  intellectual property rights in such technology  and other assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial condition and results of operations are based upon certain critical accounting policies  which include estimates  assumptions  and judgments on the part of management 
we base our estimates on various factors and information which may include  but are not limited to  history and prior experience  experience of other enterprises in the same industry  new related events  current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstance  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the following discussion highlights those policies and the underlying estimates and assumptions  which we consider critical to an understanding of the financial information in this report 
use of estimates and assumptions the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue  expenses  and contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on various factors and information which may include  but are not limited to  history and prior experience  experience of other enterprises in the same industry  new related events  and current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents investments we invest our excess cash primarily in debt instruments of high quality corporate and government issuers 
all highly liquid instruments with maturities at the date of purchase greater than ninety days are considered investments 
all instruments with maturities greater than one year from the balance sheet date are considered long term investments unless management intends to liquidate such securities in the current operating cycle 
such securities are classified as short term investments 
these securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
changes in value of these investments are primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature 
except for declines in fair value that are not considered temporary  net unrealized gains or losses on these investments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we recognize realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using the specific identification method 
fair value of financial instruments our estimates of fair value for assets and liabilities is based on a framework that establishes a hierarchy of the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available 
the disclosure of fair value estimates is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable 
in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed  the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect our significant market assumptions 
the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows level unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets  or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable eg  interest rates  yield curves  default rates  etc 
or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable 
the unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use 
revenue recognition our online search advertising revenue is primarily composed of per click fees that we charge customers 
the per click fee charged for keyword targeted listings is calculated based on the results of online bidding for keywords or page content  up to a maximum cost per keyword or page content set by the customer 
revenue also includes revenue share from licensing of private labeled versions of our adcenter platform 
revenues associated with online advertising products  including advertiser networks  are generally recognized once collectability is established  delivery of services has occurred  all performance obligations have been satisfied  and no refund obligations exist 
we pay distribution network partners based on clicks on the advertiser s ad that are displayed on the websites of these distribution network partners 
these payments are called tac and are included in cost of revenue 
the revenue derived from these arrangements that involve traffic supplied by distribution network partners is reported gross of the payment to the distribution network partners 
this revenue is reported gross due to the fact that we are the primary obligor to the advertisers who are the customers of the advertising service 
we also enter into agreements to provide private labeled versions of our products  including licenses to the adcenter platform technology 
these license arrangements may include some or all of the following elements revenue sharing based on the publisher s customer s monthly revenue generated through the adcenter application  upfront fees  minimum monthly fees  and other license fees 
we recognize upfront fees over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance  other license fees over the term of the license  and revenue sharing portions over the period in which such revenue is earned 
in all cases  revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed  and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we provide a provision against revenue for estimated reductions resulting from billing adjustments and customer refunds 
the amounts of these provisions are evaluated periodically based upon customer experience and historical trends 
deferred revenue is recorded when payments are received in advance of performance in underlying agreements 
customer deposits are recorded when customers make prepayments for online advertising 
the company evaluates individual arrangements with customers to make a determination under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc revenue recognition 
we test and record revenue accordingly 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers failing to make required payments 
this valuation allowance is reviewed on a periodic basis to determine whether a provision or reversal is required 
the review is based on factors including the application of historical collection rates to current receivables and economic conditions 
we will record an increase or reduction of the allowance for doubtful accounts if collection rates or economic conditions are more or less favorable than we anticipated 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than we anticipated or for customer specific circumstances  such as bankruptcy 

table of contents concentrations  credit risk and credit risk evaluation concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  investments  and accounts receivable 
as of december  and december   we placed our cash equivalents and investments through one financial institution  city national bank cnb  and mitigated the concentration of credit risk by placing percentage limits on the maximum portion of the investment portfolio which may be invested in any one investment instrument 
these amounts at times may exceed federally insured limits 
we have not experienced any credit losses on these cash equivalents and investment accounts and do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds 
the fair value of these accounts is subject to fluctuation based on market prices 
credit risk  customer and vendor evaluation accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from sales to customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated credit losses 
we apply judgment as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables based primarily on our evaluation of the customer s financial condition and past collection history and record a specific allowance 
in addition  we record an allowance based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
historically  such losses have been within our expectations 
revenue concentrations our largest category of customers has been intermediaries  the majority of which purchase clicks to sell into the affiliate networks of large search engine providers 
in the future  we expect revenue concentration associated with intermediary customers to be smaller due to an overall decrease in intermediary revenues and relationships 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets held or used in operations  including property and equipment and internally developed software  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
subject assets are tested for impairment at the lowest level of operations that generates cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from those of other groups of assets and liabilities 
we have determined that the equity of our single reporting unit to be the lowest level of operation at which independent cash flows could be identified 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to dispose 
as of december   there was no impairment of long lived assets 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows computer equipment to years furniture and fixtures to years software to years leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term 
when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts  and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in operating expenses 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
expenditures that substantially increase an asset s useful life are capitalized 

table of contents internal use software development costs we capitalize external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing and obtaining internal use computer software and the payroll and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to developing internal use computer software 
we exercise judgment in determining when costs related to a project may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs  and in determining the amortization period for the capitalized costs  which is generally years 
we expect to continue to invest in internally developed software and to capitalize such costs 
restructuring charges on january  our board of directors approved a plan of termination that resulted in a reduction of the workforce of approximately full positions  or approximately 
in january  the company recorded thousand in pre tax restructuring charges associated with the termination of approximately full time positions 
all restructuring charges have been classified as such on the consolidated statement of operations 
traffic acquisition costs we enter into agreements of varying durations with our distribution network partners that display our listings ads on their sites in return for a percentage of the revenue per click that we receive when the ads are clicked on those partners sites 
we also enter into agreements of varying durations with third party affiliates 
these affiliate agreements provide for variable payments based on a percentage of our revenue or based on a certain metric  such as number of searches or paid clicks 
tac expense is recorded in cost of revenue  and is based on a percentage of revenue 
advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expenses as incurred 
product development costs of new product ideas and enhancements to existing products are charged to expense as incurred 
share based compensation we recognize share based compensation costs for all share based payment transactions  including grants of stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan  over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the grant date using the black scholes method 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service periods 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant in order to estimate the amount of share based awards that will ultimately vest 
the forfeiture rate is determined at the end of each fiscal quarter  based on historical rates 
we elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and the consolidated statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee share based compensation awards 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
under the liability method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we record liabilities  where appropriate  for all uncertain income tax positions 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense

we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
historically  we have not incurred any losses or recorded any liabilities related to performance under these types of indemnities 
additionally  in the normal course of business  we have made certain guarantees  indemnities and commitments under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these indemnities include intellectual property and other indemnities to our customers and distribution network partners in connection with the sales of our products  and indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these guarantees  indemnities and commitment due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision
