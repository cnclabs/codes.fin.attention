item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  we plan on increasing the level of committed content licensing in anticipation of our service and subscriber base growing 
to the extent subscriber and or revenue growth do not meet our expectations  our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of these content licensing commitments and our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate could be limited 

table of contents if we become subject to liability for content that we distribute through our service  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
as a distributor of content  we face potential liability for negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we distribute 
we also may face potential liability for content uploaded from our users in connection with our community related content or movie reviews 
if we become liable  then our business may suffer 
litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability could harm our results of operations 
we cannot assure that we are insured or indemnified to cover claims of these types or liability that may be imposed on us 
if studios and other content distributors refuse to license streaming content to us upon acceptable terms  our business could be adversely affected 
streaming content over the internet involves the licensing of rights which are separate from and independent of the rights we acquire when obtaining dvd content 
our ability to provide our subscribers with content they can watch instantly therefore depends on studios and other content distributors licensing us content specifically for internet delivery 
the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary 
if the studios and other content distributors change their terms and conditions or are no longer willing or able to license us content  our ability to stream content to our subscribers will be adversely affected 
unlike dvd  streaming content is not subject to the first sale doctrine 
as such  we are completely dependent on the studio or other content distributor to license us content in order to access and stream content 
many of the licenses provide for the studios or other content distributor to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly 
because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take  content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice 
in addition  the studios and other content distributors have great flexibility in licensing content 
they may elect to license content exclusively to a particular provider or otherwise limit the types of services that can deliver streaming content 
for example  hbo licenses content from studios like warner bros 
and the license provides hbo with the exclusive right to such content against other subscription services  including netflix 
as such  netflix cannot license certain warner bros 
content for delivery to its subscribers while warner bros 
may nonetheless license the same content to transactional vod providers 
if we are unable to secure and maintain rights to streaming content or if we cannot otherwise obtain such content upon terms that are acceptable to us  our ability to stream tv shows and movies to our subscribers will be adversely impacted  and our subscriber acquisition and retention could also be adversely impacted 
as streaming content license agreements expire  we must renegotiate new terms which may not be favorable to us 
if this happens  the cost of obtaining content could increase and our margins may be adversely affected 
as we grow  we are able to spend an increasingly larger amount for the licensing of streaming content 
we believe that the streaming content we make available to our subscribers is sufficiently diversified  such that we will not be forced to pay licensing fees for content in excess of our desired contribution profit targets 
we believe that any failure to secure content will manifest in lower subscriber acquisition and retention and not in materially reduced margins 
given the multiple year duration and largely fixed nature of content licenses  if we do not experience subscriber acquisition and retention as forecasted  our margins may be impacted by these fixed content licensing costs 
for example  as a result of events over the past several months  we have experienced slower growth than anticipated and our margins have been negatively impacted 
during the course of our license relationship  various contract administration issues can arise 
to the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner  our relationship with the studios and other content distributors or our access to content may be adversely impacted 
we rely upon a number of partners to offer instant streaming of content from netflix to various devices 
we currently offer subscribers the ability to receive streaming content through their pcs  macs and other internet connected devices  including blu ray players and tvs  digital video players  game consoles and mobile devices 
we intend to continue to broaden our capability to instantly stream tv shows and movies to other platforms and partners over time 
if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships  or if we encounter technological  content licensing or other impediments to our streaming content  our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted 
our agreements with our consumer electronics partners are 
table of contents typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if  upon expiration  a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us 
furthermore  devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices performance  the connection between these devices and netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business 
in addition  technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices 
if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices  our service and our subscribers use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted 
if subscriptions to our domestic dvd segment decline faster than anticipated  our business could be adversely affected the number of subscriptions to our dvd by mail offering declined significantly following our price change 
we anticipate that this decline will continue 
we believe  however  that the domestic dvd business will continue to generate significant contribution profit for our business 
in addition  we believe that dvd will be a valuable consumer proposition and studio profit center for the next several years  even as dvd sales decline 
the contribution profit generated by our domestic dvd business will help provide capital resources to fund losses arising from our growth internationally 
to the extent that the rate of decline in our dvd by mail business is greater than we anticipate  our business could be adversely affected 
because we are primarily focused on building a global streaming service  the resources allocated to maintaining dvd operations and the level of management focus on our dvd business are limited 
to the extent that we experience degradation in service in our dvd by mail business  subscribers satisfaction with our service could be negatively impacted and we could experience an increase in cancellations  which could adversely impact our business 
if us copyright law were altered to amend or eliminate the first sale doctrine or if studios were to release or distribute titles on dvd in a manner that attempts to circumvent or limit the effects of the first sale doctrine  our business could be adversely affected 
under us copyright law  once a copyright owner sells a copy of his work  the copyright owner relinquishes all further rights to sell or otherwise dispose of that copy 
while the copyright owner retains the underlying copyright to the expression fixed in the work  the copyright owner gives up his ability to control the fate of the work once it had been sold 
as such  once a dvd is sold into the market  those obtaining the dvd are permitted to re sell it  rent it or otherwise dispose of it 
if congress or the courts were to change or substantially limit this first sale doctrine  our ability to obtain content and then rent it could be adversely affected 
by way of example  the court of appeals for the th circuit has ruled that the first sale doctrine did not apply to sales of software that contained contractual limitations on resales 
to the extent such a ruling were extended to dvd sales  our ability to obtain content for subsequent rental could be adversely impacted 
likewise  if content providers agree to limit the sale or distribution of their content in ways that try to limit the effects of the first sale doctrine  our business could be adversely affected 
for example  we have entered into agreements with several studios to delay the availability of new release dvds for rental for a period of time following the dvds release to the retail market and  in connection therewith  these studios have prohibited certain of their wholesalers from selling dvds to us prior to such availability 
furthermore  certain content owners  from time to time  have established exclusive rental windows with particular outlets 
this happened in late and again in late when blockbuster announced arrangements with certain content owners pursuant to which blockbuster would receive content on dvds for rental exclusively by blockbuster 
to the extent content is to be distributed exclusively and not to retail vendors or distributors  we could be prevented from obtaining such content  and those of our competitors who access such content could enjoy a corresponding competitive advantage 
to the extent the content is also sold to retail vendors or distributors  under current law  we would not be prohibited from obtaining and renting such content pursuant to the first sale doctrine 
nonetheless  to the extent content owners do not distribute to us directly or through their wholesalers or otherwise establish exclusive rental windows  it will impact our ability to obtain such content in the most efficient manner and  in some cases  in 
table of contents sufficient quantity to satisfy demand 
if such arrangements were to become more commonplace or if additional impediments to obtaining content were created  our ability to obtain content could be impacted and our business could be adversely affected 
increased availability of new releases to other distribution channels prior to  or on parity with  the release on dvd  coupled with delayed availability of such dvds through our service  could adversely affect our business 
dvds currently enjoy a competitive advantage over certain other distribution channels  such as pay per view and some types of vod distribution  because of the early distribution window on the dvd format 
the window for new releases on dvd is generally exclusive against and earlier than certain other forms of non theatrical movie distribution  such as pay per view  regular non premium vod  svod  premium pay tv  and other forms of tv exploitation 
the length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel are determined solely by the studio releasing the title 
over the past several years  we have seen distributors adjust and experiment with the traditional distribution channels and timing 
for example  certain other forms of non theatrical distribution have been developed for certain new movie releases  resulting in their non theatrical availability prior to and during the dvd window 
in addition  the major studios have shortened certain release windows and or have increasingly made new release movies available on vod simultaneously or prior to the release on dvd eg via premium vod  and in a limited number of instances  simultaneously with theatrical release 
if other distribution channels were to receive priority over  or parity with  the dvd window  coupled with delayed availability of such dvd through our service  subscriber s perception of value in our service could decrease and our business could be adversely affected 
further  as these distribution channels shift  our relative position to them  either in dvd or streaming  may impact our subscribers perception of or value in our service and our business could be adversely affected 
delayed availability of new release dvds for rental could adversely affect our business 
our licensing agreements with several studios require that we do not rent new release dvds until some period of time after such dvds are first made available for retail sale 
these agreements provide us with less expensive content as well as deeper copy depth than we might otherwise have absent the delay  thus improving both our business and consumer experience 
while several competitors have used the delayed availability of dvd content through our service to differentiate their own services  we do not believe that this delayed availability has materially impacted our subscriber growth or satisfaction 
nonetheless  it is possible that the delay in obtaining new release content could impact consumer perception of our service or otherwise negatively impact subscriber satisfaction 
furthermore  in january  warner home entertainment announced it was increasing the period of delay to fifty six days 
if other studios were to increase the period of delay and or if our subscriber satisfaction is negatively impacted by this increase in the warner delay  our business could be adversely impacted 
we could be subject to increased costs arising from our acquisition of dvd content and our subscribers demand for dvd titles that could adversely affect our operations and financial performance 
we obtain dvds through a mix of revenue sharing agreements and direct purchases 
the type of agreement we utilize to acquire dvd content depends on the economic terms we can negotiate as well as studio preferences 
if we are unable to negotiate favorable terms to acquire the dvds  our contribution profits may be adversely affected 
furthermore  during the course of our agreements  various contract administration issues can arise 
to the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner  our relationship with the studios and distributors or our access to content may be adversely impacted 
direct purchase of dvds requires us to be able to accurately forecast demand in order to ensure that we have enough copies of a title to satisfy but not exceed demand so that our subscriber satisfaction is not negatively impacted 
however  if we purchase excess copies of title or experience an increase in usage of a title without a corresponding increase in subscriber retention and growth  our content and fulfillment costs will increase disproportionately to revenues thus adversely affecting our operating results 
our content costs as a percentage of revenues can also increase if our 
table of contents subscribers select titles that were acquired under more expensive revenue share arrangements more often than they select other titles acquired through direct purchase or lower cost revenue share arrangements 
any significant disruption in our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations could result in a loss or degradation of service and could adversely impact our business 
subscribers and potential subscribers access our service through our web site or their tvs  computers  game consoles or mobile devices 
our reputation and ability to attract  retain and serve our subscribers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations 
interruptions in these systems  or with the internet in general  including discriminatory network management practices  could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill dvd selections 
from time to time  we experience service interruptions and have voluntarily provided affected subscribers with a credit during periods of extended outage 
much of our software is proprietary  and we rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our software and computer systems 
service interruptions  errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential subscribers 
our servers and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss  misuse or theft of data 
our web site periodically experiences directed attacks intended to cause a disruption in service 
any attempts by hackers to disrupt our service or our internal systems  if successful  could harm our business  be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation 
our insurance does not cover expenses related to attacks on our web site or internal systems 
efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our services 
any significant disruption to our service or internal computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third party web hosting provider 
in addition  we utilize third party internet based or cloud computing services in connection with our business operations 
we also utilize third party content delivery networks to help us stream tv shows and movies in high volume to netflix subscribers over the internet 
problems faced by our third party web hosting  cloud computing  or content delivery network providers  including technological or business related disruptions  could adversely impact the experience of our subscribers 
in addition  fires  floods  earthquakes  power losses  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely 
as we do not maintain entirely redundant systems  a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our operations and could adversely affect our business 
we rely upon amazon web services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the amazon web services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted 
amazon web services  or aws  provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations  or what is commonly referred to as a cloud computing service 
we have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing  storage capabilities and other services provided by aws 
currently  we run the vast majority of our computing on aws 
given this  along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our aws operations to another cloud provider  any disruption of or interference with our use of aws would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted 
while the retail side of amazon may compete with us  we do not believe that amazon will use the aws operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service 

table of contents if we are unable to effectively utilize our recommendation and merchandising technology or develop user interfaces that maintain or increase subscriber engagement with our service  our business may suffer 
our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandise our library to our subscribers 
we also develop  test and implement various user interfaces across multiple devices  in an effort to maintain and increase subscriber engagement with our service 
we are continually refining our recommendation and merchandising technology as well as our various user interfaces in an effort to improve the predictive accuracy of our tv show and movie recommendations and the usefulness of and engagement with our service by our subscribers 
we may experience difficulties in implementing refinements 
in addition  we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to make and implement meaningful refinements to our recommendation technology 
if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or if we are unable to implement meaningful improvements thereto or otherwise improve our user interfaces  our service may be less useful to our subscribers 
such failures could lead to the following our subscriber satisfaction may decrease  subscribers may perceive our service to be of lower value and our ability to attract and retain subscribers may be adversely affected  our ability to effectively merchandise and utilize our library will be adversely affected  and our subscribers may default to choosing titles from among new releases or other titles that cost us more to provide  and our margins may be adversely affected 
we rely heavily on our proprietary technology to stream tv shows and movies and to manage other aspects of our operations  including processing delivery and return of our dvds to our subscribers  and the failure of this technology to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 
we continually enhance or modify the technology used for our operations 
we cannot be sure that any enhancements or other modifications we make to our operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to our subscribers 
future enhancements and modifications to our technology could consume considerable resources 
if we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage the streaming of tv shows and movies to our subscribers in a timely and efficient manner and or the processing of dvds among our shipping centers  our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired 
in addition  if our technology or that of third parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly  our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired 
also  any harm to our subscribers personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we experience delivery problems or if our subscribers or potential subscribers lose confidence in the us mail system  we could lose subscribers  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we rely exclusively on the us postal service to deliver dvds from our shipping centers and to return dvds to us from our subscribers 
we are subject to risks associated with using the public mail system to meet our shipping needs  including delays or disruptions caused by inclement weather  natural disasters  labor activism  health epidemics or bioterrorism 
our dvds are also subject to risks of breakage and theft during our processing of shipments as well as during delivery and handling by the us postal service 
the risk of breakage is also impacted by the materials and methods used to replicate our dvds 
if the entities replicating our dvds use materials and methods more likely to break during delivery and handling or we fail to timely deliver dvds to our subscribers  our subscribers could become dissatisfied and cancel our service  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  increased breakage and theft rates for our dvds will increase our cost of acquiring titles 

table of contents increases in the cost of delivering dvds could adversely affect the contribution profit of our domestic dvd segment 
increases in postage delivery rates could adversely affect our domestic dvd segment s contribution profit if we elect not to raise our subscription fees to offset the increase 
the us postal service increased the rate for first class postage on may  to cents  on may  to cents and again on january  to cents 
it is expected that the us postal service will raise rates again in subsequent years in accordance with the powers given the us postal service in connection with the postal reform legislation 
the us postal service continues to focus on plans to reduce its costs and make its service more efficient 
if the us postal service were to change any policies relative to the requirements of first class mail  including changes in size  weight or machinability qualifications of our dvd envelopes  such changes could result in increased shipping costs or higher breakage for our dvds  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
for example  the office of inspector general oig at the us postal service issued a report in november recommending that the us postal service revise the machinability qualifications for first class mail related to dvds or to charge dvd mailers who don t comply with the new regulations a cent surcharge on all mail deemed unmachinable 
in addition  a by mail game rental company filed a complaint with the postal regulatory commission alleging that the us postal service unreasonably discriminated against it in favor of netflix and blockbuster 
to the extent this proceeding was to result in operational or regulatory changes impacting our mail processing  our domestic dvd segment s contribution profit and business operations could be adversely affected 
for example  the us postal service recently announced changes to its service that would close many of its mail processing facilities and eliminate next day service for first class mail 
if such changes result in slower delivery of our dvds or otherwise lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change  we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business  or incur greater operating expenses 
the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws  which may impose additional burdens on us 
if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation  this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 
the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth  popularity or use of the internet  including laws limiting internet neutrality  could decrease the demand for our subscription service and increase our cost of doing business 
for example  in late  the federal communications commission adopted so called net neutrality rules intended  in part  to prevent network operators from discriminating against legal traffic that transverse their networks 
the rules are currently subject to legal challenge 
to the extent that these rules are interpreted to enable network operators to engage in discriminatory practices or are overturned by legal challenge  our business could be adversely impacted 
as we expand internationally  government regulation concerning the internet  and in particular  network neutrality  may be nascent or non existent 
within such a regulatory environment  coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators  we could experience discriminatory or anti competitive practices that could impede our growth  cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business 
changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business 
we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet 
to the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing  including meaningful bandwidth caps  or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers  we could incur greater operating expenses and our subscriber acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted 
for example  in late  comcast informed level communications that it would require level to pay for the ability to access comcast s network 
given that much of the traffic being requested by comcast customers is netflix data stored with level  many 
table of contents commentators have looked to this situation as an example of comcast either discriminating against netflix traffic or trying to increase netflix s operating costs 
furthermore  to the extent network operators were to create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers  our business could be negatively impacted 
most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming 
as such  companies like comcast  time warner cable and cablevision have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success 
while we believe that consumer demand  regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives  to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours  our business could be negatively impacted 
in international markets  especially in latin america  these same incentives apply however  the consumer demand  regulatory oversight and competition may not be as strong as in our domestic market 
privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data and our disclosure of or unauthorized access to subscriber data could adversely impact our business and reputation 
in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with merchandising our service to our subscribers  we collect and utilize data supplied by our subscribers 
we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information 
other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users browsing and other habits 
increased regulation of data utilization practices  including self regulation or findings under existing laws  that limit our ability to use collected data  could have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  if unauthorized access to our subscriber data were to occur or if we were to disclose data about our subscribers in a manner that was objectionable to them  our business reputation could be adversely affected  and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results 
our reputation and relationships with subscribers would be harmed if our subscriber data  particularly billing data  were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 
we maintain personal data regarding our subscribers  including names and  in many cases  mailing addresses 
with respect to billing data  such as credit card numbers  we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to secure such information 
we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers data 
if  despite these measures  we  or our payment processing services  experience any unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers data  current and potential subscribers may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become subscribers  we could face legal claims  and our business could be adversely affected 
similarly  if a well publicized breach of the consumer data security of any other major consumer web site were to occur  there could be a general public loss of confidence in the use of the internet for commerce transactions which could adversely affect our business 
in addition  we do not obtain signatures from subscribers in connection with the use of credit cards by them 
under current credit card practices  to the extent we do not obtain cardholders signatures  we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions  even when the associated financial institution approves payment of the orders 
from time to time  fraudulent credit cards are used on our web site to obtain service and access our dvd inventory and streaming 
typically  these credit cards have not been registered as stolen and are therefore not rejected by our automatic authorization safeguards 
while we do have a number of other safeguards in place  we nonetheless experience some loss from these fraudulent transactions 
we do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent credit card transactions 
a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our business and results of operations 

table of contents increases in payment processing fees or changes to operating rules would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our subscribers pay for our subscription services predominately using credit cards and debit cards 
our acceptance of these payment methods requires our payment of certain fees 
from time to time  these fees may increase  either as a result of rate changes by the payment processing companies or as a result in a change in our business practices which increase the fees on a cost per transaction basis 
such increases may adversely affect our results of operations 
we are subject to rules  regulations and practices governing our accepted payment methods  which are predominately credit cards and debit cards 
these rules  regulations and practices could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply 
if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements  we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept these payment methods  and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 
if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors  the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished  and our business may be adversely affected 
we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships  as well as trademark  copyright  patent and trade secret protection laws  to protect our proprietary rights 
we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings 
we have filed and from time to time we expect to file for trademark and patent applications 
nevertheless  these applications may not be approved  third parties may challenge any patents issued to or held by us  third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents  trademarks and other proprietary rights  and we may not be able to prevent infringement without substantial expense to us 
if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties  the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished  competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations  the perception of our business and service to subscribers and potential subscribers may become confused in the marketplace  and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected 
intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to  among other things  our web site  streaming technology  our recommendation and merchandising technology  title selection processes and marketing activities 
trademark  copyright  patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies 
our intellectual property rights extend to our technology  business processes and the content on our web site 
we use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights 
from time to time  third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights  successfully defend our use  or develop non infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement  misappropriation  misuse or other violation of third party intellectual property rights  our business and competitive position may be adversely affected 
many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business 
there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet 
we have not searched patents relative to our technology 
defending ourselves against intellectual property claims  whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor  results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel 
it also may result in our inability to use our current web site  streaming technology  our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products 
as a result of a dispute  we may have to develop non infringing technology  enter into royalty or licensing agreements  adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims 
these actions  if required  may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

table of contents if we are unable to protect our domain names  our reputation and brand could be adversely affected 
we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand  including netflix 
com 
failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service 
the acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by governmental agencies and their designees 
the regulation of domain names in the united states may change in the near future 
governing bodies may establish additional top level domains  appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names 
as a result  we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names 
furthermore  the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear 
we may be unable  without significant cost or at all  to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to  infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 
in the event of an earthquake or other natural or man made disaster  our operations could be adversely affected 
our executive offices and data centers are located in the san francisco bay area 
we have shipping centers located throughout the united states  including earthquake and hurricane sensitive areas 
our business and operations could be adversely affected in the event of these natural disasters as well as from electrical blackouts  fires  floods  power losses  telecommunications failures  break ins or similar events 
we may not be able to effectively shift our fulfillment and delivery operations to handle disruptions in service arising from these events 
because the san francisco bay area is located in an earthquake sensitive area  we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to  or total destruction of  our executive offices and data centers 
we are not insured against any losses or expenses that arise from a disruption to our business due to earthquakes and may not have adequate insurance to cover losses and expenses from other natural disasters 
we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management s time and attention 
from time to time  we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 
as we have grown  we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us 
most of these matters relate to patent infringement lawsuits  which are typically expensive to defend 
litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses  could occupy a significant amount of our management s time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 
we could be subject to economic  political  regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations 
we offer an unlimited streaming plan in canada  latin america and beginning in early we expanded our streaming service offering to the uk and ireland 
operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory  economic and political risks that are different from and incremental to those in the united states 
in addition to the risks that we face in the united states our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business  including the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences  including licensing a certain portion of our content library before we have developed a full appreciation for its performance within a given territory  difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations  management distraction  political or social unrest and economic instability  compliance with us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act  and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials  
table of contents difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws  regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  less favorable foreign intellectual property laws  adverse tax consequences  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk  profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds  differing processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods  such as credit and debit cards  new and different sources of competition  low usage of internet connected consumer electronic devices  different and more stringent user protection  data protection  privacy and other laws  and availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion 
our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our future international operations and our overall business  and results of our operations 
we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 
from time to time  we may seek to obtain additional capital  either through equity  equity linked or debt securities 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  we raised million of additional capital through the sale of million worth of convertible notes in a private placement and million worth of equity through a public offering 
the decision to obtain additional capital will depend  among other things  on our development efforts  business plans  operating performance and condition of the capital markets 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity linked or debt securities  those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock  and our stockholders may experience dilution 
we have issued million in debt offerings and may incur additional debt in the future  which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 
as of december   we have million in senior notes and million in zero coupon senior convertible notes outstanding 
risks relating to our long term indebtedness include requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the markets in which we operate  and limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms we find acceptable 
in addition  it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business 
the terms of indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations 
if new debt is added to current debt levels  the risks described above could intensify 

table of contents the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and also require us to meet certain covenants 
the failure to comply with such covenants could have a material adverse effect on us 
the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants  including those that restrict our ability to  among other things borrow money  and guarantee or provide other support for indebtedness of third parties including guarantees  pay dividends on  redeem or repurchase our capital stock  make investments in entities that we do not control  including joint ventures  enter into certain asset sale transactions  enter into secured financing arrangements  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and enter into unrelated businesses

we may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees 
we rely on the continued service of our senior management  including our chief executive officer and co founder reed hastings  members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees 
in our industry  there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business  product development  technical and other personnel 
we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel  which may be disruptive to our operations 
risks related to our stock ownership provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 
our charter documents may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they authorize our board of directors  without stockholder approval  to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock  provide for a classified board of directors  prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent  establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings  and prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders 
in addition  a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our executive severance and retention incentive plan  thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction 
as a delaware corporation  we are also subject to certain delaware anti takeover provisions 
under delaware law  a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or  among other things  the board of directors has approved the transaction

table of contents our stock price is volatile 
the price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly 
the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following  some of which are beyond our control variations in our operating results  variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts  investors and the financial community  announcements of developments affecting our business  systems or expansion plans by us or others  competition  including the introduction of new competitors  their pricing strategies and services  market volatility in general  the level of demand for our stock  including the amount of short interest in our stock  and the operating results of our competitors 
as a result of these and other factors  investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 
following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities  we became the subject of securities litigation 
we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility 
this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
financial forecasting by us and financial analysts who may publish estimates of our performance may differ materially from actual results 
given the dynamic nature of our business  the current uncertain economic climate and the inherent limitations in predicting the future  forecasts of our revenues  contribution margins  net income and  number of total and paid subscriber additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results 
such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock
