business overview we are a leading integrated brand owner  manufacturer and distributor of non alcoholic beverages in the united states us  canada and mexico with a diverse portfolio of flavored carbonated soft drinks csds and non carbonated beverages ncbs  including ready to drink teas  juices  juice drinks and mixers 
our brand portfolio includes popular csd brands such as dr pepper  sunkist soda  up  a w  canada dry  crush  squirt  pe afiel and schweppes  and ncb brands such as snapple  mott s  hawaiian punch  clamato  rose s and mr mrs t mixers 
our largest brand  dr pepper  is a leading flavored csd in the united states according to the nielsen company 
we have some of the most recognized beverage brands in north america  with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers 
we operate primarily in the us  mexico and canada and we also distribute our products in the caribbean 
in  of our net sales were generated in the united states  in canada and in mexico and the caribbean 
our business model our brand ownership businesses 
as a brand owner  we build our brands by promoting brand awareness through marketing  advertising and promotion and by developing new and innovative products and product line extensions that address consumer preferences and needs 
as the owner of the formulas and proprietary know how required for the preparation of beverages  we manufacture  sell and distribute beverage concentrates and syrups used primarily to produce csds and we manufacture  sell and distribute primarily finished ncbs 
most of our sales of beverage concentrates are to bottlers who manufacture  bottle  sell and distribute our branded products into retail channels 
we also manufacture  sell and distribute syrups for use in beverage fountain dispensers to restaurants and retailers  as well as to fountain wholesalers  who resell it to restaurants and retailers 
in addition  we distribute finished ncbs through company owned and third party distributors 
our beverage concentrates and brand ownership businesses are characterized by relatively low capital investment  raw materials and employee costs 
although the cost of building or acquiring an established brand can be significant  established brands typically do not require significant ongoing expenditures  other than marketing  and therefore generate relatively high margins 
our packaged beverages brand ownership businesses have characteristics of both of our brand ownership businesses as well as our manufacturing and distribution businesses discussed below 
our manufacturing and distribution businesses 
we manufacture  sell and distribute finished csds from concentrates and finished ncbs and products mostly from ingredients other than concentrates 
we sell and distribute packaged beverages and other products primarily into retail channels either directly to retail shelves or to warehouses through our large fleet of delivery trucks or through third party logistics providers 
our manufacturing and distribution businesses are characterized by relatively high capital investment  raw material  selling and distribution costs  in each case compared to our beverage concentrates and brand ownership businesses 
our capital costs include investing in  and maintaining  our company owned fleet  facilities and manufacturing and warehouse equipment 
our raw material costs include purchasing beverage concentrates  ingredients and packaging materials from a variety of suppliers 
our selling and distribution costs include significant costs related to operating our large fleet of delivery trucks and employing a significant number of employees to sell and deliver finished beverages and other products to retailers 
as a result of the high fixed costs associated with these types of businesses  we are focused on maintaining an adequate level of volumes as well as controlling 
table of contents capital expenditures  raw material  selling and distribution costs 
in addition  geographic proximity to our customers is a critical component of managing the high cost of transporting finished beverages relative to their retail price 
the profitability of the manufacturing and distribution businesses is also dependent upon our ability to sell our products into higher margin channels 
as a result of these factors  the margins of our manufacturing and distribution businesses are significantly lower than those of our brand ownership businesses 
in light of the largely fixed cost nature of the manufacturing and distribution businesses  increases in costs  for example raw materials tied to commodity prices  could have a significant negative impact on the margins of our businesses 
approximately of our packaged beverages net sales of branded products come from our own brands  with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as big red  arizona tea  fiji mineral water  neuro beverages  vita coco coconut water and hydrive energy drinks 
in addition  a small portion of our packaged beverages sales come from fees charged for bottling beverages and other products for private label owners or others 
integrated business model 
we believe our integrated business model strengthens our route to market by creating a third consolidated bottling system 
by owning a significant portion of our manufacturing and distribution network we are able to improve focus on our owned and licensed brands  especially brands such as up  sunkist soda  a w  sun drop and snapple  which do not have a large presence in coca cola and pepsico affiliated bottler systems 
provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses 
for example  we can focus on maximizing profitability for our company as a whole rather than focusing on profitability generated from either the sale of concentrates or the manufacturing and distribution of our products 
enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers  including coordinating sales  service  distribution  promotions and product launches 
allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage 
trends affecting our business we believe the key trends influencing the north american lrb market include changes in economic factors 
we believe changes in economic factors could impact consumers purchasing power which may result in a decrease in purchases of our premium beverages and single serve packages 
increased health consciousness 
we believe the main beneficiaries of this trend include diet and low calorie drinks  ready to drink teas and bottled waters 
changes in lifestyle 
we believe changes in lifestyle will continue to drive increased sales of single serve beverages  which typically have higher margins 
growing demographic segments in the us we believe marketing and product innovations that target fast growing population segments  such as the hispanic community in the us  will drive further market growth 
product and packaging innovation 
we believe brand owners and bottling companies will continue to create new products and packages such as beverages with new ingredients and new premium flavors  as well as innovative convenient packaging that address changes in consumer tastes and preferences 
changing retailer landscape 
as retailers continue to consolidate  we believe retailers will support consumer product companies that can provide an attractive portfolio of products  a strong value proposition and efficient delivery 
volatility in the costs of commodities 
the costs of a substantial portion of the commodities used in the beverage industry are dependent on commodity prices for aluminum  natural gas  fuel  resins  corn  pulp and other commodities 
commodity price volatility has exerted pressure on industry margins and operating results 

table of contents seasonality the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations 
our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations 
segments we report our business in three operating segments beverage concentrates  packaged beverages and latin america beverages 
the key financial measures management uses to assess the performance of our segments are net sales and segment operating profit sop 
beverage concentrates our beverage concentrates segment is principally a brand ownership business 
in this segment we manufacture and sell beverage concentrates in the us and canada 
most of the brands in this segment are csd brands 
in  our beverage concentrates segment had net sales of approximately billion 
key brands include dr pepper  canada dry  crush  schweppes  up  sunkist soda  a w  sun drop  rc cola  diet rite  squirt  welch s  country time  vernors and the concentrate form of hawaiian punch 
we are the industry leader in flavored csds with a market share in the united states for  as measured by retail sales according to nielsen 
we are also the third largest csd brand owner as measured by retail sales in the us and canada and we own a leading brand in most of the csd categories in which we compete 
almost all of our beverage concentrates are manufactured at our plant in st 
louis  missouri 
the beverage concentrates are shipped to third party bottlers  as well as to our own manufacturing systems  who combine them with carbonation  water  sweeteners and other ingredients  package it in pet containers  glass bottles and aluminum cans  and sell it as a finished beverage to retailers 
beverage concentrates are also manufactured into syrup  which is shipped to fountain customers  such as fast food restaurants  who mix the syrup with water and carbonation to create a finished beverage at the point of sale to consumers 
dr pepper represents most of our fountain channel volume 
concentrate prices historically have been reviewed and adjusted at least on an annual basis 
our beverage concentrates brands are sold by bottlers  including our own packaged beverages segment  through all major retail channels including supermarkets  fountains  mass merchandisers  club stores  vending machines  convenience stores  gas stations  small groceries  drug chains and dollar stores 
unlike the majority of our other csd brands  of dr pepper volumes are distributed through the coca cola affiliated and pepsico affiliated bottler systems 
pepsico and coca cola are the two largest customers of the beverage concentrates segment  and constituted approximately and  respectively  of the segment s net sales during 
packaged beverages our packaged beverages segment is principally a brand ownership  manufacturing and distribution business 
in this segment  we primarily manufacture and distribute packaged beverages and other products  including our brands  third party owned brands and certain private label beverages  in the united states and canada 
in  our packaged beverages segment had net sales of approximately billion 
key ncb brands in this segment include snapple  hawaiian punch  mott s  yoo hoo  clamato  deja blue  arizona  fiji  mistic  nantucket nectars  realemon  mr and mrs t  rose s and country time 
key csd brands in this segment include up  dr pepper  a w  sunkist soda  canada dry  squirt  rc cola  big red  sun drop  diet rite  ibc and vernors 
approximately of our packaged beverages net sales of branded products come from our own brands  with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as big red  arizona tea  fiji mineral water  neuro beverages  vita coco coconut water and hydrive energy drinks 
a portion of our sales also comes from bottling beverages and other products for private label owners or others for a fee 
although the majority of our packaged beverages net sales relate to our brands  we also provide a route to market for third party brand owners seeking effective distribution for their new and emerging brands 
these brands give us exposure in certain markets to fast growing segments of the beverage industry with minimal capital investment 

table of contents our packaged beverages products are manufactured in multiple facilities across the us and are sold or distributed to retailers and their warehouses by our own distribution network or by third party distributors 
the raw materials used to manufacture our products include aluminum cans and ends  glass bottles  pet bottles and caps  paper products  sweeteners  juices  water and other ingredients 
we sell our packaged beverages products both through our direct store delivery system dsd  supported by a fleet of approximately  trucks and  employees  including sales representatives  merchandisers  drivers and warehouse workers  as well as through our warehouse direct delivery system wd  both of which include the sales to all major retail channels  including supermarkets  fountain channel  mass merchandisers  club stores  vending machines  convenience stores  gas stations  small groceries  drug chains and dollar stores 
in  wal mart stores  inc  the largest customer of our packaged beverages segment  accounted for approximately of our net sales in this segment 
latin america beverages our latin america beverages segment is a brand ownership  manufacturing and distribution business 
this segment participates mainly in the carbonated mineral water  flavored csd  bottled water and vegetable juice categories  with particular strength in carbonated mineral water and grapefruit flavored csds 
in  our latin america beverages segment had net sales of million with our operations in mexico representing approximately of the net sales of this segment 
key brands include pe afiel  squirt  clamato and aguafiel 
in mexico  we manufacture and distribute our products through our bottling operations and third party bottlers and distributors 
in the caribbean  we distribute our products through third party bottlers and distributors 
in mexico  we also participate in a joint venture to manufacture aguafiel brand water with acqua minerale san benedetto 
we provide expertise in the mexican beverage market and acqua minerale san benedetto provides expertise in water production and new packaging technologies 
we sell our finished beverages through all major mexican retail channels  including mom and pop stores  supermarkets  hypermarkets  and on premise channels 
volume in evaluating our performance  we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates or finished beverages 
beverage concentrates sales volume in our beverage concentrates segment  we measure our sales volume in two ways concentrates case sales and bottler case sales 
the unit of measurement for both concentrates case sales and bottler case sales equals fluid ounces of finished beverage  or twelve ounce servings 
concentrates case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors 
a concentrates case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of fluid ounces of finished beverage 
it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate 
our net sales in our concentrates businesses are based on concentrates cases sold 
although our net sales in our concentrates businesses are based on concentrates case sales  we believe that bottler case sales  as defined below  are also a significant measure of our performance because they measure sales  both by us and our bottlers  of our finished beverages into retail channels 
packaged beverages sales volume in our packaged beverages segment  we measure volume as case sales to customers 
a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us 
case sales include both our owned brands and certain brands licensed to and or distributed by us 

table of contents volume in bottler case sales in addition to sales volume  we also measure volume in bottler case sales volume bcs as sales of packaged beverages  in equivalent fluid ounce cases  sold by us and our bottlers to retailers and independent distributors 
bottler case sales and concentrates and packaged beverage sales volumes are not equal during any given period due to changes in bottler concentrates inventory levels  which can be affected by seasonality  bottler inventory and manufacturing practices  and the timing of price increases and new product introductions

liquidity and capital resources trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity customer and consumer demand for the company s products may be impacted by recession or other economic downturn in the united states  canada  mexico or the caribbean  which could result in a reduction in our sales volume

table of contents critical accounting estimates the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assessments 
these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience  future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates and judgments 
we have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting estimates 
see note of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize sales revenue when all of the following have occurred delivery  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the title and the risk of loss passes to the customer according to the terms of the contract between the customer and us 
the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on contract terms 
for sales to customers that are designated in the contract as free on board destination  revenue is recognized when the product is delivered to and accepted at the customer s delivery site 
net sales are reported net of costs associated with customer marketing programs and incentives  as described below  as well as sales taxes and other similar taxes 
multiple deliverables were included in the arrangements entered into with pepsico and coca cola during in this case  we first determined whether each deliverable met the separation criteria under us gaap 
the primary requirement for a deliverable to meet the separation criteria is if the deliverable has standalone value to the customer 
each deliverable that meets the separation criteria is considered a separate unit of accounting 
as the sale of the manufacturing and distribution rights and the ongoing sales of concentrate would not have standalone value to the customer  both deliverables represent a single element of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
the one time nonrefundable cash receipts from pepsico and coca cola were therefore recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as net sales ratably over the estimated year life of the customer relationship 
customer marketing programs and incentives the company offers a variety of incentives and discounts to bottlers  customers and consumers through various programs to support the distribution of its products 
these incentives and discounts include cash discounts  price allowances  volume based rebates  product placement fees and other financial support for items such as trade promotions  displays  new products  consumer incentives and advertising assistance 
these incentives and discounts are reflected as a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net sales 
the aggregate deductions from gross sales recorded in relation to these programs were approximately  million   million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  the company upgraded its sap platform in dsd 
as part of the upgrade  dps harmonized its gross list price structure across locations 
the impact of the change increased gross sales and related discounts by equal amounts on customer invoices 
net sales were not affected 
the amounts of trade spend are larger in our packaged beverages segment than those related to other parts of our business 
accruals are established for the expected payout based on contractual terms  volume based metrics and or historical trends and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with us gaap we classify intangible assets into three categories intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
the majority of our intangible asset balance is made up of brands which we have determined to have indefinite useful lives 
in arriving at the conclusion that a brand has an indefinite useful life  management reviews factors such as size  diversification and market share of each brand 
management expects to acquire  hold and support brands for an indefinite period through consumer marketing and promotional support 
we also consider factors such as our ability to continue to protect the legal rights that arise from these brand names indefinitely or the absence of any regulatory  economic or competitive factors that could truncate the life of the brand name 
if the criteria are not met to assign an indefinite life  the brand is amortized over its expected useful life 
we conduct tests for impairment in accordance with us gaap 
for intangible assets with definite lives  we conduct tests for impairment if conditions indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  we conduct tests for impairment annually  as of december  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we use present value and other valuation techniques to make this assessment 
if the carrying amount of goodwill or an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
for purposes of impairment testing we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising 
table of contents from each business combination and also assign indefinite lived intangible assets to our reporting units 
we define reporting units as beverage concentrates  latin america beverages  and packaged beverages two reporting units  dsd and wd 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  impairment is recorded 
the impairment tests for goodwill include comparing a fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill and considering any indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges step 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  impairment is indicated and a second step step analysis must be performed 
the tests for impairment include significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the reporting units and intangible assets primarily by analyzing forecasts of future revenues and profit performance 
fair value is based on what the reporting units and intangible assets would be worth to a third party market participant 
discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt  adjusted with various risk premiums 
these assumptions could be negatively impacted by various of the risks discussed in risk factors in this annual report on form k 
impairment analysis based on our review of the facts and circumstances and updated assumptions  we did not recalculate the fair values for the annual impairment analysis of our goodwill  brands or distribution rights during we employed a carryforward approach  in accordance with us gaap  since we concluded it was remote that changes in the facts and circumstances would have caused the fair value of these assets to fall below their carrying amounts 
this conclusion was based on the following factors the fair value of our goodwill  brands and distribution rights exceeded their carrying amounts by a substantial margin in the annual impairment analysis performed  our business performance during was in line with our forecast used to estimate fair value in the impairment analysis performed during  our outlook for and beyond is in line with the forecast used to estimate fair value in the impairment analysis performed during  other significant assumptions used in estimating fair value  such as our weighted average cost of capital  have improved since the impairment analysis performed  the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting units have not changed significantly since the fair value determination  and we have experienced significant appreciation in our market capitalization 
as such  no impairment was required for our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill as of december  and impairment analyses fair value is measured based on what each intangible asset or reporting unit would be worth to a third party market participant 
for our annual impairment analysis performed as of december  and  methodologies used to determine the fair values of the assets included an income based approach  as well as an overall consideration of market capitalization and our enterprise value 
management s estimates of fair value  which fall under level  are based on historical and projected operating performance 
discount rates were based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt and were adjusted with various risk premiums 
as of december  and  the results of the step analysis indicated that the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values and  therefore  were not impaired 
pension and postretirement benefits we have several pension and postretirement plans covering employees who satisfy age and length of service requirements 
there are five stand alone non contributory defined benefit pension plans and six stand alone postretirement plans 
depending on the plan  pension and postretirement benefits are based on a combination of factors  which may include salary  age and years of service 
pension expense has been determined in accordance with the principles of us gaap 
our policy is to fund pension plans in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act 
employee benefit plan obligations and expenses included in our consolidated financial statements are determined from actuarial analyses based on plan assumptions  employee demographic data  years of service  compensation  benefits and claims paid and employer contributions 
the expense related to the postretirement plans has been determined in accordance with us gaap 
we accrue the cost of these benefits during the years that employees render service to us 
the calculation of pension and postretirement plan obligations and related expenses is dependent on several assumptions used to estimate the present value of the benefits earned while the employee is eligible to participate in the plans 
the key assumptions we use in determining the plan obligations and related expenses include the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the plan liabilities  employee turnover  retirement age and mortality  and the expected return on plan assets 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and our best judgment regarding future performance 
due to the significant judgment 
table of contents required  our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and postretirement obligations and expenses 
refer to note of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information 
the effect of a increase or decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to determine the pension benefit obligations for us plans would change the benefit obligation as of december   by approximately million and million  respectively 
the effect of a increase or decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension costs would change the costs for the year ended december   by approximately million each 
the effect of a increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets used to determine the net periodic pension costs would change the costs for the year ended december  by approximately million each 
risk management programs we retain selected levels of property  casualty  workers compensation  health and other business risks 
many of these risks are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or self insured retentions 
accrued liabilities related to the retained casualty and health risks are calculated based on loss experience and development factors  which contemplate a number of variables including claim history and expected trends 
these loss development factors are established in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries 
at december  and  we had accrued liabilities related to the retained risks of million and million  respectively  including both current and long term liabilities 
we believe the use of actuarial methods to estimate our future losses provides a consistent and effective way to measure our self insured liabilities 
however  the estimation of our liability is judgmental and uncertain given the nature of claims involved and length of time until their ultimate cost is known 
the final settlement amount of claims can differ materially from our estimate as a result of changes in factors such as the frequency and severity of accidents  medical cost inflation  legislative actions  uncertainty around jury verdicts and awards and other factors outside of our control 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach under us gaap 
this method involves determining the temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and the corresponding amounts recognized for tax purposes and computing the tax related carryforwards at the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the resulting amounts are deferred tax assets or liabilities and the net changes represent the deferred tax expense or benefit for the year 
the total of taxes currently payable per the tax return and the deferred tax expense or benefit represents the income tax expense or benefit for the year for financial reporting purposes 
we periodically assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets based on the amount of deferred tax assets that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset primarily on historical earnings  our estimate of current and expected future earnings  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and current and future ownership changes 
as of december  and  undistributed earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in non us subsidiaries totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
deferred income taxes have not been provided on this income as the company believes these earnings to be permanently reinvested 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on these undistributed foreign earnings 
our effective income tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to various factors  including  but not limited to  total earnings and the mix of earnings by jurisdiction  the timing of changes in tax laws  and the amount of tax provided for uncertain tax positions 
we establish income tax reserves to remove some or all of the income tax benefit of any of our income tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but for a lesser amount  or the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken 
our evaluation of whether or not a tax position is uncertain is based on the following we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position  and each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken 
we adjust these income tax reserves when our judgment changes as a result of new information 
any change will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made
