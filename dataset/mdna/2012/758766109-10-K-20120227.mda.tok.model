item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and cash flows of regal entertainment group for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of regal and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview and basis of presentation we conduct our operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the united states  consisting of  screens in theatres in states and the district of columbia as of december  we believe the size  reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale from our theatre operations 
we also maintain an investment in national cinemedia  which concentrates on in theatre advertising 
the company manages its business under one reportable segment theatre exhibition operations 
we generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales 
additional revenues are generated by our vendor marketing programs  our gift card and discount ticket programs and various other activities in our theatres 
in addition  national cinemedia provides us with a theatre access fee associated with revenues generated from its sale of on screen advertising  concerts and other events 
film rental costs depend on a variety of factors  including the prospects of a film  the popularity and box office revenues of a film  and such film rental costs generally increase as the admissions revenues generated by a film increase 
because we purchase certain concession items  such as fountain drinks and popcorn  in bulk and not pre packaged for individual servings  we are able to improve our margins by negotiating volume discounts 
other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs 
the company s revenues are usually seasonal  coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors 
generally  motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and holiday seasons 
the unexpected emergence or continuance of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional pattern 
the timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on the company s results of operations  and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for the next or any other fiscal quarter 
the seasonality of motion picture exhibition  however  has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
for a summary of other industry trends as well as other risks and uncertainties relevant to the company  see business industry overview and trends and risk factors 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate and modify on an ongoing basis such estimates and assumptions  which include those related to film costs  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes and purchase accounting as well as others discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
estimates and 
table of contents assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ materially from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies are discussed elsewhere within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  if applicable  where such estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording theatre acquisitions 
under current purchase accounting principles  we are required to use the acquisition method of accounting to estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities  including i the acquired tangible and intangible assets  including property and equipment  ii the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition including contingencies  and iii the related deferred tax assets and liabilities 
because the estimates we make in purchase accounting can materially impact our future results of operations  for significant acquisitions  we have obtained assistance from third party valuation specialists in order to assist in our determination of fair value 
the company provides the assumptions to the third party valuation firms based on information available to us at the acquisition date  including both quantitative and qualitative information about the specified assets or liabilities 
the company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained 
the company then uses the information to determine fair value 
the third party valuation firms are supervised by company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value 
the company evaluates the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilized by the third party valuation firm 
the estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts 
historically  the estimates made have not experienced significant changes and  as a result  we have not disclosed such changes 
fasb accounting standards codification asc subtopic  intangibles goodwill and other goodwill specifies that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be subject to an annual impairment assessment 
based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of the goodwill  we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
we estimate our film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management s best estimate of the expected box office revenue of each film over the length of its run in our theatres and the ultimate settlement of such film costs with the distributors 
generally  less than one third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period end 
the length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film play  but is typically settled within two to three months of a particular film s opening release 
upon settlement with our film distributors  film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement 
the ultimate revenues of a film can be estimated reasonably accurately within a few weeks after the film is released based on the film s initial box office performance  which is 
table of contents determined by a film s initial box office receipts 
as a result  there are typically insignificant variances between our estimates of film cost expense and the final film cost payable  because we make such estimates based on each film s box office receipts through the end of the reporting period 
for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december   there were no significant changes in our film cost estimation and settlement procedures 
we depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment relating to both owned and leased theatres on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
each owned theatre consists of a building structure  structural improvements  seating and concession and film display equipment 
while we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than years to certain acquired facilities  we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an average economic useful life of years 
certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than years 
with respect to equipment eg  concession stand  point of sale equipment  etc  a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less  which has been our historical replacement period 
seats and digital projection equipment generally have a longer useful economic life  and their depreciable lives years are based on our experience and replacement practices 
the estimates of the assets useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized 
further  we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary 
to the extent we determine that certain of our assets have become obsolescent  we accelerate depreciation over the remaining useful lives of the assets 
for example  in connection with our deployment of leased digital projection systems to theatres across our circuit  the company has accelerated depreciation of its owned mm film projection equipment that is scheduled to be replaced with leased digital projection systems  with such depreciation occurring over the expected deployment schedule since the company plans to dispose of such equipment prior to the end of its useful life 
to that end  during the fiscal years ended december  and december   the company recorded approximately million and million  respectively  of accelerated depreciation related to such mm film projection equipment  as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates 
the majority of our properties have been appraised 
such appraisals supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes 
furthermore  our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies 
finally  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
such analysis generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets  such assets are written down to fair value 
our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical wear and tear or functional inadequacy or obsolescence factors 
in this regard  we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods 
for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december   no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets  the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization  or the methodology applied 
for the fiscal year ended december   consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was million  representing of consolidated total revenues 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by 
table of contents approximately million  or 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately million  or 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we reassess the need for such valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
an increase in the valuation allowance generally results in an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded in such period 
a decrease in the valuation allowance generally results in a decrease to the provision for income taxes recorded in such period 
additionally  income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation  require judgment by us and may be challenged by the taxing authorities 
as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  effective december   the company adopted the provisions of asc subtopic  income taxes overview 
although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable  in accordance with asc subtopic  we recognize a tax benefit only for tax positions that we determine will more likely than not be sustained based on the technical merits of the tax position 
with respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate  the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our process for determining our provision for income taxes 
among other items deemed relevant by us  the evaluations are based on new legislation  other new technical guidance  judicial proceedings  and our specific circumstances  including the progress of tax audits 
any change in the determination of the amount of tax benefit recognized relative to an uncertain tax position impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination is made 
for fiscal  our provision for income taxes was million 
changes in management s estimates and assumptions regarding the probability that certain tax return positions will be sustained  the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities  the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets  or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could impact the provision for income taxes and change the effective tax rate 
a one percentage point change in the effective tax rate from to would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately million 
significant events and fiscal outlook during the fiscal years ended december  fiscal period  december  fiscal period and december  fiscal period  the company entered into various financing transactions which are more fully described under liquidity and capital resources financing activities below and in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
as discussed further under liquidity and capital resources investing activities below  during the fiscal period  we received from national cinemedia approximately million newly issued common units of national cinemedia 
this adjustment increased the number of national cinemedia common units held by us to approximately million and as a result  on a fully diluted basis  we own a interest in ncm  inc as of december  
table of contents during the fiscal period  we continued to make progress with respect to the following strategic initiatives we demonstrated our commitment to providing incremental value to our stockholders 
total cash dividends distributed to our stockholders during the fiscal period totaled approximately million 
we opened three new theatres with screens and closed theatres with screens  ending the fiscal period with theatres and  screens 
we continue to embrace innovative concepts to deliver a premium movie going experience for our customers on three complementary fronts first  during fiscal  we completed our deployment of d compatible digital projection systems across our circuit 
as of december   we operated  screens outfitted with digital projection systems   of which are digital d capable approximately of our total screens 
we expect substantially all of our screens to be outfitted with digital projection systems by late or early in addition  we continued to expand our imax footprint by installing an additional imax digital projection systems during fiscal  bringing our total to imax screens as of december  we believe that expanding our imax footprint will continue to have a positive impact on our operating results 
finally  during fiscal  we added our proprietary large screen format known as regal premium experience rpx sm to auditoriums  bringing our total to rpx sm screens as of as of december  we have been encouraged by the results of rpx sm screens and expect to expand our rpx sm footprint to between and auditoriums by the end of we believe the installation of d digital projection systems and imax theatres systems and the conversion of existing auditoriums to rpx sm auditoriums allow us to offer our patrons premium d movies and all digital large format experiences that we believe generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the company 
we are pleased with the benefits of digital cinema primarily as it relates to d film product and other d content and with the continued support of d and imax film product by the major motion picture studios 
second  to continually address consumer trends and customer preferences  we have focused on expanding our menu of food and beverage products to include hot made to order meals  customizable coffee  healthy snacks  alcohol and other specialty products in select theatres 
to that end  during fiscal  we introduced several new items including boneless chicken wings  cheese sticks  hamburgers  chicken sandwiches and jalapeno poppers in approximately theatres and also offer beer and wine in other locations 
in addition  as of december   we have successfully launched five cinebarre locations which offer patrons the convenience of a variety of lunch and dinner menu options  including beer and wine  served at the customer s seat before and during the featured film 
we believe that the enhancement of our food and beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our attendance and operating results and expect to invest in such food and beverage offerings in our theatres during fiscal and beyond 
third  we continued our focus on interactive marketing programs aimed at increasing attendance and enhancing the overall customer experience 
for example  we maintain a frequent moviegoer loyalty program  named the regal crown club  in all of our markets 
regal crown club members are eligible for specified awards  such as concession items  based on purchases made at our participating theatres 
as of december   we had over six million active members in the regal crown club  making it the largest loyalty program in our industry 
in addition  we seek to develop patron loyalty through a number of other marketing programs such as selective discounting of ticket and concession prices in certain markets  summer children s film series  cross promotional ticket redemptions and promotions within local communities 
we plan to use these programs in future markets where we believe patron loyalty can be further enhanced  and 
table of contents will continue to evaluate our markets on a case by case basis to determine the suitability of these programs in individual regions 
finally  during the fiscal period  we announced the creation of open road films  a new film distribution company that is jointly owned by us and amc 
we believe that open road films has a unique opportunity to fill a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios big budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost effective manner which we believe will drive additional patrons to our theaters and generate a return on our capital investment 
open road films released its first film  the killer elite  in late september and its second film  the grey  in january and expects to eventually distribute approximately eight to ten films per year 
as of december   we have invested approximately million in cash in open road films and ultimately expect to invest up to million in this joint venture 
we account for our investment in open road films using the equity method of accounting 
we believe our investment in open road films will generate incremental value for our stockholders 
we are optimistic regarding the breadth of the film slate  including the timing of the release schedule and the number of films scheduled for release in premium priced formats 
evidenced by the motion picture studios continued efforts to promote and market upcoming film releases  appears to be another year of high profile releases such as john carter  the hunger games  wrath of the titans  the avengers  dark shadows  battleship  men in black iii  snow white and the huntsman  madagascar europe s most wanted  prometheus  the amazing spiderman  ice age continental drift  the dark knight rises  total recall  skyfall  the twilight saga breaking dawn part  gravity  the hobbit an unexpected journey  rise of the guardians and the great gatsby 
we intend to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and through accretive acquisitions 
with respect to capital expenditures  subject to the timing of certain construction projects  we expect capital expenditures net of proceeds from asset sales to be in the range of million to million for fiscal  consisting of new theatre development  expansion of existing theatre facilities  upgrades and replacements 
overall for the fiscal year  we expect to benefit from modest increases in ticket prices and average concessions per patron 
in addition  we expect fiscal admissions and concessions revenues to be supported by our continued focus on efficient theatre operations and through opportunities to expand our concession offerings 
we will continue to maintain a business strategy focused on the evaluation of accretive acquisition opportunities  selective upgrades and premium experience opportunities and providing incremental returns to our stockholders 
for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years  the preceding and following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto presented in part ii  item of this form k 
results of operations based on our review of industry sources  national box office revenues for the time period that corresponds to regal s fiscal were estimated to have decreased by approximately four percent in comparison to fiscal the industry s box office results were negatively impacted by difficult comparisons generated by strong attendance from premium priced films released during  including the record breaking performance of avatar and strong attendance from other top tier releases such as toy story  alice in wonderland  iron man and inception 
the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items included in our consolidated statements of income for the fiscal period  the fiscal period

percentage of revenues calculated as a percentage of concessions revenues 
percentage of revenues calculated as a percentage of total revenues 
calculated as admissions revenue attendance 
calculated as concessions revenue attendance 

table of contents fiscal period compared to fiscal period admissions during the fiscal period  total admissions revenues decreased million  or  to  million  from  million in the fiscal period primarily due to a decrease in attendance and a decrease in average ticket price 
we believe that our attendance is primarily dependent upon the commercial appeal of content released by the major motion picture studios 
the fiscal period decline in attendance was primarily attributable to a decline in the appeal to our patrons of the films exhibited in our theatres during the fiscal period as compared to the films exhibited during the fiscal period  which included the record breaking performance of avatar and strong attendance from other top tier releases such as toy story  alice in wonderland  iron man and inception 
the primary driver of the decrease in our fiscal period average ticket price was a decrease in the percentage of our admissions revenues generated by premium priced films exhibited during the fiscal period  partially offset by selective price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews which include analysis of various factors such as general inflationary trends and local market conditions 
concessions total concessions revenues decreased million  or  to million during the fiscal period  from million for the fiscal period 
average concessions revenues per patron during the fiscal period increased  to  from for the fiscal period 
the decrease in total concessions revenues during the fiscal period was attributable to the aforementioned decrease in attendance during the period  partially offset by the increase in average concessions revenues per patron 
the increase in average concessions revenues per patron for the fiscal period was primarily a result of increases in popcorn and beverage sales volume during the fiscal period  selective price increases effected subsequent to the end of the fiscal period and to a lesser extent  the impact of expanded concession menu items introduced in certain of our theatres during such periods 
other operating revenues during the fiscal period  other operating revenues increased million  or  to million  from million in the fiscal period 
included in other operating revenues are the theatre access fees paid by national cinemedia net of payments for onscreen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire  revenues from our vendor marketing programs  arcade game revenue and revenues related to our gift card and discount ticket programs 
the increase in other operating revenues during the fiscal period was primarily driven by increases in national cinemedia revenues and incremental other theatre revenues  partially offset by decreases in gift card and discount ticket program revenues 
film rental and advertising costs film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of admissions revenues decreased to during the fiscal period from in the fiscal period 
the decrease in film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of box office revenues during the fiscal period was primarily attributable to higher film costs associated with the success of avatar during the fiscal period 
cost of concessions during the fiscal period  cost of concessions decreased million  or  to million as compared to million during the fiscal period 
cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues for the fiscal period was approximately  compared to during the fiscal period 
the decrease in cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues during the fiscal period was primarily related to increases in popcorn and beverage sales volume and selective price increases effected subsequent to the end of the fiscal period 

table of contents rent expense rent expense decreased by million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the decrease in rent expense during the fiscal period was primarily related to a reduction in our screen count subsequent to the end of the fiscal period and slightly lower contingent rent during the fiscal period 
other operating expenses other operating expenses decreased million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the decrease in other operating expenses during the fiscal period was attributable to savings in theatre level payroll  other non rent occupancy costs and a reduction in costs associated with lower premium format film revenues 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses during the fiscal period was primarily attributable to decreases in certain corporate expenses and share based compensation expense  partially offset by slightly higher corporate payroll costs and legal and professional fees during the period 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period was primarily due to a reduction in depreciation related to the replacement of owned mm film projectors with leased digital projection systems 
income from operations income from operations increased million  or  to million during the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the net increase in income from operations during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period was primarily attributable to a reduction in certain variable operating expense line items described above  partially offset by a decrease in total revenues  and a greater loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets and other million and million  respectively  for the fiscal period and fiscal period 
interest expense  net during the fiscal period  net interest expense increased million  or  to million  from million in the fiscal period 
the increase in net interest expense during the fiscal period was principally due to incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of the million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes in august and the shift in our debt portfolio resulting from the first quarter of issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes 
these items were partially offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting from the repurchases of our convertible senior notes due march  the the convertible senior notes during the second half of fiscal and first quarter of 
table of contents earnings recognized from ncm earnings recognized from ncm decreased million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the decrease in earnings recognized from ncm during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period was primarily attributable to slightly lower earnings of national cinemedia 
income taxes the provision for income taxes of million and million for the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively  reflect effective tax rates of approximately and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal period is primarily attributable to changes in uncertain tax positions with state taxing authorities resulting from the lapse of statute of limitations and clarifications of tax law  as well as increases in federal hiring credits during the fiscal period as described further in note income taxes 
the effective tax rates for such periods also reflect the impact of certain non deductible expenses and other income tax credits 
net income attributable to controlling interest net income attributable to controlling interest for the fiscal period was million  which represents a decrease of million  from net income attributable to controlling interest of million during the fiscal period 
the decrease in net income attributable to controlling interest for the fiscal period was primarily attributable the impact of the million million after related tax effects gain on sale of ncm  inc common stock recorded during the fiscal period  incremental losses from the company s equity investment in open road films during the fiscal period included in other  net  and the impairment of our investment in reald  inc recorded in the fiscal period  partially offset by an increase in operating income during the fiscal period as described above 
fiscal period compared to fiscal period admissions during the fiscal period  total admissions revenues decreased million  or  to  million  from  million in the fiscal period 
an decline in attendance  partially offset by a increase in average ticket prices  led to the decrease in the fiscal period admissions revenues 
we believe that our attendance is primarily dependent upon the commercial appeal of content released by the major motion picture studios 
the fiscal period decline in attendance was primarily attributable to the overall lack of appeal to our patrons of the films exhibited in our theatres during the fiscal period as compared to the films exhibited during the fiscal period 
an increase in the percentage of our admissions revenues generated by premium priced d and imax films exhibited during the fiscal period along with price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews which include analysis of various factors such as general inflationary trends and local market conditions were the primary drivers of the increase in our fiscal period average ticket prices 
based on our review of certain industry sources  the decrease in our admissions revenues on a per screen basis was slightly greater than the industry s results for the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period 
we believe the greater than industry decrease in admissions revenues on a per screen basis in the fiscal period was attributable to geographical differences in film product performance 
concessions total concessions revenues decreased million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
average concessions revenues per patron during 
table of contents the fiscal period increased  to  from for the fiscal period 
the increase in average concessions revenues per patron for the fiscal period was primarily a result of selective price increases 
other operating revenues during the fiscal period  other operating revenues increased million  or  to million  from million in the fiscal period 
included in other operating revenues are the theatre access fees paid by national cinemedia net of payments for onscreen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire  revenues from our vendor marketing programs and other theatre revenues  including revenue related to our gift card and discount ticket programs 
the slight increase in other operating revenues during the fiscal period was primarily driven by increases in revenues related to our gift card and discount ticket programs and other theatre revenues  partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our vendor marketing programs 
film rental and advertising costs film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of admissions revenues of during the fiscal period were consistent with that of the fiscal period 
film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of admissions revenues during the fiscal period was primarily impacted by higher film costs associated with the success of avatar  offset by a reduction in newspaper advertising costs 
cost of concessions for the fiscal period  cost of concessions as a percentage of concession revenues was approximately  compared to for the fiscal period 
the decrease in cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues during the fiscal period was primarily related to selective price increases effected subsequent to the end of the fiscal period  slightly lower raw material costs for certain items and a shift in the mix and sizes of products sold at the concession stand 
in addition  we also experienced an increase in the amount of vendor marketing revenue recorded as a reduction of cost of concessions during the fiscal period 
rent expense rent expense increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the increase in rent expense during the fiscal period was primarily attributable to incremental rent associated with the screens acquired from an affiliate of amc  partially offset by a reduction in rent associated with the closure of screens subsequent to the end of the fiscal period 
other operating expenses during the fiscal period  other operating expenses increased million  or  to million  from million in the fiscal period 
the increase in other operating expenses during the fiscal period was attributable to increased costs associated with higher d and imax film revenues and incremental dcip related expenses  partially offset by savings in theatre level payroll and non rent occupancy costs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million during the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to during the fiscal period  from in the fiscal period 
the increase in general and administrative expenses during the fiscal period 
table of contents was primarily attributable to increases in stock based compensation expense and corporate payroll costs during the period 
depreciation and amortization during the fiscal period  depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million  from million in the fiscal period 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period was primarily due to accelerated depreciation of million related to the replacement of mm film projectors in connection with our conversion to digital projection systems  partially offset by slightly lower capital expenditures during the fiscal period 
income from operations income from operations decreased million  or  to million during the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the net decrease in income from operations during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period was primarily attributable to the overall decrease in total revenues and the fixed cost nature of certain operating expense line items including rent expense and other operating expenses  partially offset by a lower loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets million and million  respectively  for the fiscal period and fiscal period 
interest expense  net during the fiscal period  net interest expense declined million  or  to million  from million in the fiscal period 
the decrease in net interest expense during the fiscal period was principally due to a lower average effective interest rate on our term facility as a result of a change in our interest rate swap portfolio during the fiscal period  a reduction in interest expense resulting from the repurchases of our convertible senior notes and incremental interest income during the fiscal period  partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of the million regal cinemas senior notes due the senior notes in july and the issuance of the senior notes in august earnings recognized from ncm the company received million and million  respectively  in cash distributions from national cinemedia including payments received under the tax receivable agreement described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k during the fiscal period and fiscal period 
approximately million and million  respectively  of these cash distributions received during the fiscal period and the fiscal period were recognized as a reduction in our investment in national cinemedia 
the remaining amounts were recognized in equity earnings during each of these periods and have been included as a component of earnings recognized from ncm in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the increase in earnings recognized from national cinemedia during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period was primarily attributable to slightly higher earnings of national cinemedia and the timing of their contractual cash distributions to the company 
income taxes the provision for income taxes of million and million for the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively  reflect effective tax rates of approximately and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal period is primarily attributable to a decrease in the effective tax rates in certain states and the lapse of statute of limitations on uncertain 
table of contents tax positions with state taxing authorities during the fiscal period 
the effective tax rates for such periods also reflect the impact of certain non deductible expenses and income tax credits 
net income attributable to controlling interest net income attributable to controlling interest for the fiscal period was million  which represents a decrease of million  from net income attributable to controlling interest of million during the fiscal period 
the decrease in net income attributable to controlling interest for the fiscal period was primarily attributable to a reduction in operating income  the fiscal period loss on debt extinguishment associated with our sixth amended and restated credit agreement the amended senior credit facility with credit suisse  ag  cayman islands branch  as administrator agent credit suisse and the lenders party thereto the lenders and certain repurchases of the convertible senior notes  incremental losses from the company s equity investment in dcip  partially offset by the impact of the million million after related tax effects gain on sale of ncm  inc common stock

see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for further information related to our impairment policies 
during the quarter ended december   the company considered various factors pertaining to its investment in reald  inc as part of its ongoing impairment review and determined that an other than temporary impairment existed as of december  such determination was based primarily on the length approximately six months of time during which the fair value of the reald  inc investment remained substantially below the recorded investment cost basis of approximately per share  the severity of the decline during such period and the prospects of recovery of the investment to its original cost basis 
as a result  the company recorded a million other than temporary impairment charge to write down its cost basis in reald  inc  shares to fair value as of december  the fair value of reald  inc common shares was based on the publicly traded common stock price of reald  inc as of december  of per share 
liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis  we expect our primary uses of cash to be for operating expenses  capital expenditures  investments  general corporate purposes related to corporate operations  debt service and the company s quarterly dividend payments 
the principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  cash on hand and borrowings under the amended senior credit facility described below 
under the terms of the amended senior credit facility and the senior notes issued during fiscal  regal cinemas is restricted as to how much it can advance or distribute to regal  its indirect parent 
since regal is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries  this restriction could impact regal s ability to effect future debt or dividend payments  pay corporate expenses or redeem or convert for cash its senior notes 
in addition  as described further below  the indenture under which the senior notes are issued limits the company s and its restricted subsidiaries ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of its capital stock  purchase or redeem capital stock  make loans or advances to its subsidiaries or the company  or purchase  redeem or otherwise acquire or retire certain subordinated obligations 
operating activities our revenues are generated principally through admissions and concessions sales with proceeds received in cash or via credit cards at the point of sale 
our operating expenses are primarily related to film and advertising costs  rent and occupancy  and payroll 
film costs are ordinarily paid to distributors within days following receipt of admissions revenues and the cost of the company s concessions are generally paid to vendors approximately to days from purchase 
our current liabilities generally include items that will become due within months 
in addition  from time to time  we use cash from operations and borrowings to fund dividends in excess of net income attributable to controlling interest and cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from investing and other financing activities 
as a result  at any given time  our balance sheet may reflect a working capital deficit 

table of contents as further described note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  the company maintains an investment in national cinemedia  a pass through entity for federal income tax purposes 
the internal revenue service irs is currently examining national cinemedia s and income tax returns and  as of december   has proposed an adjustment related to agreements entered into in conjunction with ncm inc s ipo 
management is currently evaluating the proposed adjustment but does not anticipate the adjustment would result in a material change to the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company believes that it is reasonably possible that an increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to this position may be necessary within the next twelve months  however the amount of such unrecognized tax benefits is not reasonably estimable as of december  net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately million  million and million for the fiscal period  the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively 
the million increase in net cash flows generated by operating activities for the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period increase was caused by a million increase in net income excluding non cash items coupled with a positive fluctuation in working capital activity of approximately million 
in the fiscal period  a million reduction in accrued expenses and other liabilities was the primary driver of working capital activity that negatively impacted cash flow from operating activities by million 
the reduction in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily related to the timing of real estate tax and other lease related payments and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits 
in the fiscal period  a million increase in trade and other receivables and a million reduction in accounts payable were the primary components of working capital activity that negatively impacted cash flows from operating activities by million 
the increase in trade and other receivables during the fiscal period was primarily associated with increased third party sales of our gift cards and discount tickets during the latter part of and with the timing of our estimated federal and state income tax payments 
the decrease in accounts payable primarily film rental liabilities in the fiscal period was primarily due to lower attendance and box office revenue at our theaters during the latter part of the period coupled with the timing of certain film payments

the increase in accounts payable primarily film rental liabilities in the fiscal period was primarily due to increased attendance and box office revenue at our theaters in the latter part of the fiscal period and the timing of certain film payments 
investing activities our capital requirements have historically arisen principally in connection with acquisitions of theatres  new theatre construction  strategic partnerships  adding new screens to existing theatres  upgrading the company s theatre facilities and replacing equipment 
we fund the cost of capital 
table of contents expenditures through internally generated cash flows  cash on hand  proceeds from disposition of assets and financing activities 
during june  we completed our deployment of d compatible digital projection systems across our circuit 
we believe the installation of d digital projection systems and imax theatres systems and the conversion of existing auditoriums to rpx 
sm 
auditoriums allow us to offer our patrons premium d movies and large all digital format experiences that we believe generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the company 
we are pleased with the benefits and future potential of digital cinema primarily as it relates to d film product and other d content and with the continued support of d and imax film product by the major motion picture studios 
as of december   we operated  screens outfitted with digital projection systems 
we expect to outfit substantially all of our screens with digital projection systems by late or early we intend to continue to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and acquisition opportunities 
the company has a formal and intensive review procedure for the authorization of capital projects  with the most important financial measure of acceptability for a discretionary non maintenance capital project being whether its projected discounted cash flow return on investment meets or exceeds the company s internal rate of return targets 
the credit crisis of late and early negatively impacted real estate development and has caused a temporary slowdown in our building program 
we currently expect capital expenditures net of proceeds from asset sales for theatre development  expansion  upgrading and replacements to return to more normalized levels and in the range of approximately million to million in fiscal year  exclusive of acquisitions 
on march   dcip executed definitive agreements and related financing transactions in connection with the conversion to digital projection 
dcip s financing raised approximately million  consisting of approximately million in senior bank debt  approximately million in additional junior capital and approximately million in equity contributions consisting of cash and existing digital projection systems from us  amc and cinemark 
concurrent with closing  the company entered into a master equipment lease agreement the master lease and other related agreements collectively  the digital cinema agreements with kasima  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of dcip 
upon execution of the digital cinema agreements  the company made equity contributions to dcip of approximately million  consisting of million in cash and existing digital projection systems with a fair value of approximately million collectively  the dcip contributions 
after giving effect to the dcip contributions  the company holds a economic interest in dcip as of december   while continuing to maintain a one third voting interest along with each of amc and cinemark 
since the company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of dcip or any of its subsidiaries  it will continue to account for its investment in dcip under the equity method of accounting 
dcip s initial financing described above  coupled with a second round of financing completed in march which consisted of a new million term loan facility  will cover the cost of conversion to digital projection for our entire circuit 
dcip funds the cost of conversion to digital projection principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors  including us 
in accordance with the master lease  the digital projection systems are leased from kasima  llc under a twelve year term with ten one year fair value renewal options 
the master lease also contains a fair value purchase option 
under the master lease  the company pays annual minimum rent of  per digital projection system from the effective date of the agreement through the end of the lease term and is  upon certain conditions described below  subject to incremental annual rent of  per digital projection system beginning at six and a half years from the effective date of the agreement through the end of the lease term 
in the event that the junior capital raised by dcip in the initial financing transactions remains outstanding at any time on or after the date that is six and a half years after the closing date of march 
table of contents  the holders of the related notes will have the right to require the company and other participating exhibitors to make incremental minimum rent payments of  per digital projection system per year through the earlier of the end of the lease term or until such notes are repaid 
the company considers both the  minimum rental and the incremental minimum rental payment of  per digital projection system to be minimum rents and accordingly has recorded such rents on a straight line basis in its consolidated financial statements 
the company is also subject to various types of other rent if such digital projection systems do not meet minimum performance requirements as outlined in the master lease 
certain of the other rent payments are subject to either a monthly or an annual maximum 
the company accounts for the master lease as an operating lease for accounting purposes 
during the fiscal years ended december  and december   the company incurred total rent of approximately million and million  respectively  associated with the leased digital projection systems 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  during the fiscal period  we received from national cinemedia approximately million newly issued common units of national cinemedia in accordance with the annual adjustment provisions of the common unit adjustment agreement 
this transaction caused a proportionate increase in the company s additional investments tranche and increased our ownership share in national cinemedia to million common units 
as a result  on a fully diluted basis  we own a interest in ncm  inc as of december  during the fiscal period  we announced the creation of open road films 
we believe that open road films has a unique opportunity to fill a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios big budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost effective manner which we believe will drive additional patrons to our theaters and generate a return on our capital investment 
open road films released its first film  the killer elite  in late september and its second film  the grey  in january and expects to eventually distribute approximately eight to ten films per year 
as of december   we have invested approximately million in cash in open road films and ultimately expect to invest up to million in this joint venture 
we account for our investment in open road films using the equity method of accounting 
during the quarter ended december   the company considered various factors pertaining to its investment in reald  inc as part of its ongoing impairment review and determined that an other than temporary impairment existed as of december  such determination was based primarily on the length approximately six months of time during which the fair value of the reald  inc investment remained substantially below the recorded investment cost basis of approximately per share  the severity of the decline during such period and the prospects of recovery of the investment to its original cost basis

net cash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately million  million and million for the fiscal period  the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively 
the million increase in cash flows used in investing activities during the fiscal period  as compared to the fiscal period  was primarily attributable to the impact of net proceeds of approximately million related to the sale of ncm  inc common stock during the fiscal period  a million reduction in proceeds from the disposition of assets during the fiscal period and incremental cash contributions to our various investments in non consolidated entities during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period  partially offset by the impact of the million acquisition of eight amc theatres during the fiscal period  an million reduction in capital expenditures during the fiscal period and million in proceeds received in connection with a property insurance claim during the fiscal period 
contributing to the 
table of contents million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities during the fiscal period  as compared to the fiscal period  was the impact of net proceeds totaling approximately million resulting from the sale of ncm  inc common stock  coupled with lower capital expenditures and higher proceeds from the disposition of assets during the fiscal period  partially offset by the million acquisition of eight amc theatres and approximately million of cash contributions to dcip during the fiscal period 
financing activities on january   regal issued and sold million in aggregate principal amount of the company s senior notes at a price equal to of their face value 
the notes were issued under an existing indenture entered into by and between the company and the trustee  dated august   as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture  dated january  in addition  on february   regal issued and sold million in aggregate principal amount of the company s senior notes at a price equal to of their face value

the company used the net proceeds to repay approximately million of the amended senior credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
as a result of this repayment  coupled with the execution of the refinancing agreement described below  the company recorded an aggregate loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million during the quarter ended march  on february   regal cinemas entered into the refinancing agreement the refinancing agreement with regal  the guarantors  credit suisse  and the lenders  which amends and refinances the term facility under the amended senior credit facility the term facility described further in note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to the refinancing agreement  regal cinemas consummated a permitted secured refinancing of the term facility in the amount of  million the new term loans  and in accordance therewith  the lenders advanced the new term loans in an aggregate principal amount of  million with a final maturity date in august together with other amounts provided by regal cinemas  proceeds of the new term loans were applied to repay all of the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the term facility under the amended senior credit facility in effect immediately prior to the making of the new term loans 
in addition to extending the maturity date of the new term loans  the refinancing agreement also amends the amended senior credit facility by reducing the interest rate on the new term loans  by providing  at regal cinemas option  either a base rate or an adjusted libor rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin that is determined according to the consolidated leverage ratio of regal cinemas and its subsidiaries 
such applicable margin will be either or in the case of base rate loans and either or in the case of libor rate loans 
the refinancing agreement also amends the second amended and restated guaranty and collateral agreement  dated may   to exclude margin stock as defined therein from the grant of the security interest in the collateral as defined therein used to secure the obligations under the amended senior credit facility 
as further described in note to the audited consolidated financial statements  on march   regal issued million aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior

subsequent to the issuance of the senior notes issued during fiscal  the company used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase a total of approximately million aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior notes  in a series of privately negotiated transactions 
during march  we redeemed the remaining million aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior notes  at a redemption price of of their principal amount  plus accrued interest 
as of december   we had approximately million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the new term loans  million aggregate principal amount outstanding including premium under the senior notes and million aggregate principal amount outstanding net of debt discount under the senior notes

as of december   we are in full compliance with all agreements  including all related covenants  governing our outstanding debt obligations 
the company is rated by nationally recognized rating agencies 
the significance of individual ratings varies from agency to agency 
however  companies assigned ratings at the top end of the range have  in the opinion of certain rating agencies  the strongest capacity for repayment of debt or payment of claims  while companies at the bottom end of the range have the weakest capability 
ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that the company s current ratings will continue for any given period of time 
an upgrade or downgrade of the company s debt ratings  depending on the extent  could affect the cost to borrow funds 
there were no upgrades or downgrades to the company s debt ratings that materially impacted our ability or cost to borrow funds during the fiscal year ended december  during the fiscal period  regal paid four quarterly cash dividends of per share on each outstanding share of the company s class a and class b common stock  or approximately million in the aggregate 
on february   the company declared a cash dividend of per share on each share of the company s class a and class b common stock including outstanding restricted stock  payable on march   to stockholders of record on march  these dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand 
we  at the discretion of the board of directors and subject to applicable law  anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our class a and class b common stock for the foreseeable future

net cash flows used in financing activities were approximately million  million and million for the fiscal period  the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively 
the net decrease in cash flows used in financing activities during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period of million was primarily attributable to a million decrease in dividends paid to shareholders during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period  million less cash used to redeem the company s remaining convertible senior notes  the impact of million cash used to redeem our senior subordinated notes the senior subordinated notes during the fiscal period  and lower debt acquisition costs during the fiscal period  partially offset by a million of incremental net payments on long term debt obligations including the amended senior credit facility described above

ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda was approximately million  million and million for the fiscal period  the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively 
the decrease in ebitda in the fiscal period from the fiscal period was primarily attributable to the impact of the gain on sale of ncm  inc common stock during the fiscal period  the impairment of our investment in reald  inc  and incremental losses from the company s equity investment in open road films included in other  net during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period  partially offset by an increase in operating income for the fiscal period 
the company uses ebitda as a supplemental liquidity measure because we find it useful to understand and evaluate our capacity  excluding the impact of interest  taxes  and non cash depreciation and amortization charges  for servicing our debt  paying dividends and otherwise meeting our cash needs  prior to our consideration of the impacts of other potential sources and uses of cash  such as working capital items 
we believe that ebitda is useful to investors for these purposes as well 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net cash provided by or used in operating activities  as determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  since it omits the impact of interest  taxes and changes in working capital that use or provide cash such as receivables  payables and inventories as well as the sources or uses of cash associated with changes in other balance sheet items such as long term loss accruals and deferred items 
because ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization  ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for the replacement of the assets being depreciated and amortized  which assets will often have to be replaced in the future 
further  ebitda  because it also does not reflect the impact of debt service  income taxes  cash dividends  capital expenditures and other cash commitments from time to time as described in more detail elsewhere in this form k  does not represent how much discretionary cash we have available for other purposes 
nonetheless  ebitda is a key measure expected by and useful to our fixed income investors  rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe  and we concur  that these measures are critical to the capital markets analysis of our ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures  pay dividends and otherwise meet cash needs  respectively 
we also evaluate ebitda because it is clear that movements in these non gaap measures impact our ability to attract financing and pay dividends

these four interest rate swap agreements were designated to hedge  million of variable rate debt obligations at an effective rate as of december  on september   one of our interest rate swaps designated to hedge million of variable rate debt obligations matured 
as a result  the company s three interest rate swap agreements effective as of december  hedge an aggregate of million of variable rate debt obligations at an effective rate of approximately 
under the terms of the company s effective interest rate swap agreements as of december   regal cinemas pays interest at various fixed rates ranging from to and receives interest at a variable rate based on the month libor 
the month libor rate on each reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate swaps for the following three month period 
the interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar quarter  until expiration 
at such dates  the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense 
no premium or discount was incurred upon the company entering into the interest rate swaps  because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swaps represented prevailing rates for each counterparty at the time the interest rate swaps were entered into 
the interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such  the company has effectively hedged its exposure to variability in the future cash flows attributable to the month libor on million of variable rate obligations 
the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion reported in earnings interest expense 
as interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation  amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to the designated hedging instruments the three interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap 

table of contents during the quarter ended september   regal cinemas entered into an additional hedging relationship via a distinct interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of june  and a maturity term of three years from the effective date of the swap
