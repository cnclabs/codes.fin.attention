item business overview we are a biomedical products company focused on commercializing the intercept blood system to enhance blood safety 
the intercept blood system  which is based on our proprietary technology for controlling biological replication  is designed to inactivate blood borne pathogens in donated blood components intended for transfusion 

table of contents we have worldwide rights for our intercept blood system for three blood components platelets  plasma and red blood cells 
the intercept blood system for platelets  or platelet system  and the intercept blood system for plasma  or plasma system  have received ce marks and are being marketed and sold in a number of countries in europe  the commonwealth of independent states  or cis  the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world 
we sell both the platelet and plasma systems using our direct sales force and through distributors 
in addition  we are developing and plan to perform the required clinical trials for our intercept blood system for red blood cells  or red blood cell system  for approval in europe 
subject to the availability of adequate funding from partners  government grants and or capital markets  we intend to complete development activities for the red blood cell system necessary for regulatory approval in europe and we may seek regulatory approval of our products in the united states 
we were incorporated in california in and reincorporated in delaware in our wholly owned subsidiary  cerus europe bv  was formed in the netherlands in information regarding our revenue  net loss  and total assets for the last three fiscal years can be found in the consolidated financial statements and related notes found elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
product development background the intercept blood system is designed to broadly target and inactivate blood borne pathogens  such as viruses for example  hiv  west nile  sars  hepatitis b and c  bacteria and parasites  as well as potentially harmful white blood cells  while preserving the therapeutic properties of platelet  plasma and red blood cell transfusion products 
the intercept blood system inactivates a broad array of pathogens and has the potential to reduce the risk of transfusion related transmission of pathogens for which testing is not completely effective or is not currently performed 
we believe that the intercept blood system also has the potential to inactivate most new pathogens before they are identified and before tests are developed and adopted commercially to detect their presence in donated blood 
products  product candidates and development activities we have worldwide commercial rights for all intercept blood system products 
the following table identifies our products and product development programs and their current status product or product under development product or development status intercept blood system platelets commercialized in a number of countries in europe  the cis  the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world united states phase iii clinical trial completed  seeking united states food and drug administration  or fda  concurrence on an additional phase iii clinical trial intercept blood system plasma commercialized in a number of countries in europe  the cis  the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world united states orphan drug designation for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura  phase iii clinical trials completed  seeking clarity on clinical pathway with the fda intercept blood system red blood cells phase i clinical trial completed in  preparing for initiation of phase iii clinical trials to support ce mark approval in europe united states seeking clarity on clinical pathway via special protocol assessment process with the fda 
table of contents intercept blood system for platelets the platelet system is designed to inactivate blood borne pathogens in platelets donated for transfusion 
the platelet system has received ce mark approval in europe and is marketed and sold in a number of countries in europe  the cis  the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world 
separate approvals for use of intercept treated platelet products have been obtained in france and switzerland 
in germany and austria  where approvals must be obtained by individual blood centers for use of intercept treated platelets  several centers have obtained such approvals 
many countries outside of europe accept the ce mark and have varying additional administrative or regulatory processes before the platelet system can be made commercially available 
in general  these processes do not require additional clinical trials 
in addition to regulatory approvals  some potential customers  including the largest branch of the german red cross  may desire to conduct their own clinical studies before adopting the platelet system 
we completed a phase iii clinical trial of the platelet system in the united states in march and a supplemental analysis of data from this trial in  and submitted this information along with several other modules of our pre market approval application  or pma  to the fda 
the fda has indicated that the clinical trial data and supplemental analysis are not sufficient to support a pma and we will therefore need to conduct and complete an additional phase iii clinical trial before we can complete our regulatory submission to the fda 
in november  we and the fda presented a proposed clinical trial protocol for a second phase iii clinical trial for platelets to the fda s blood product advisory committee  or bpac 
the outcome of that meeting was the support for the design and endpoints of a clinical trial for intercept treated platelets  subject to changes regarding the sensitivity of the safety endpoint 
we are currently in discussions with the fda regarding further details of the proposed additional phase iii clinical trial 
however  until the final study size and design requirements are determined  we will not be able to assess the feasibility of an additional phase iii clinical trial 
currently  we have no plans to initiate such a clinical trial unless adequate funding is secured 
intercept blood system for plasma the plasma system is designed to inactivate blood borne pathogens in plasma donated for transfusion 
the plasma system has received ce mark approval in europe and is marketed and sold in a number of countries in europe  the cis  the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world 
separate approvals for use of intercept treated plasma products have been obtained in france and switzerland 
in germany and austria  approvals must be obtained by individual blood centers for use of intercept treated plasma 
one such center in germany has received such an approval 
many countries outside of europe accept the ce mark and have varying additional administrative or regulatory processes before the plasma system can be made commercially available 
in general  these processes do not require additional clinical trials 
in addition to regulatory approvals  some potential customers may desire to conduct their own clinical studies before adopting the plasma system 
we have completed phase iiia  phase iiib and phase iiic clinical trials of the plasma system in the united states  reports for which were filed with the fda during we have not submitted any applications for regulatory approval of the plasma system in the united states 
we have received orphan drug status by the fda office of orphan products development for intercept treated plasma for the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura  or ttp 
although we have completed phase iii clinical trials in this patient population  the fda may require supportive supplemental data collected in commercial use in ttp patients receiving intercept treated plasma in europe  or they may require us to complete additional phase iii clinical trials  before approval would be granted 
we are seeking clarity on the clinical pathway with the fda  and we do not yet know if the fda will require any additional clinical trials 
if additional clinical trials are required for approval  we will likely only initiate such trials if adequate funding can be secured 
intercept blood system for red blood cells the red blood cell system is designed to inactivate blood borne pathogens in red blood cells donated for transfusion 
in  we completed a series of in vitro and in vivo tests with the red blood cell system 
in 
table of contents addition  we initiated a phase i clinical trial of the red blood cell system in the fourth quarter of and completed the trial in early  successfully meeting the clinical trial s primary endpoint of red cell recovery measured twenty four hours after transfusion 
in order to obtain ce mark approval  we have submitted a clinical trial application to european regulators for a proposed phase iii clinical trial for acute anemia patients in europe 
if the clinical trial application is approved  we expect to enroll and conduct a phase iii clinical trial for acute anemia patients in europe using intercept treated red blood cells beginning in we are also planning to prepare a clinical trial application for a phase iii clinical trial for chronic anemia patients in europe 
we expect to conduct a further process validation study in europe prior to commencement of such trials 
previously  we terminated phase iii clinical trials for acute and chronic anemia for a prior generation of the red blood cell system 
the trials were terminated due to the detection of antibody reactivity to intercept treated red blood cells in two patients in the study for chronic anemia 
the antibody eventually cleared and the patients had no adverse health consequences 
after unblinding the data from the original phase iii clinical trials  we found that we had met the primary end point in the clinical trial for acute anemia 
prior to commencing the phase i clinical trial in  we evaluated the antibodies detected in the original phase iii clinical trials and developed process changes to diminish the likelihood of antibody reactivity in red blood cells treated with our modified process 
there were no adverse events associated with intercept treated red blood cells evident in the trial 
based on the results from the clinical trial  we plan to conduct the planned acute anemia phase iii clinical trials in europe using the modified process  if our clinical trial application is approved by european regulators 
in the united states  we believe that the fda will likely require us to complete an additional recovery and lifespan study and at least one additional phase iii clinical trial before we would be able to potentially obtain approval for intercept treated red blood cells in the united states 
we are seeking clarity on the clinical pathway for the red blood cell system through the special protocol assessment  or spa  process with the fda by seeking concurrence from the fda on the trial protocol for the potential additional phase iii clinical trial 
a spa is an agreement between the sponsor and the fda indicating that the sponsor s proposed trial protocol  including clinical endpoints and statistical analyses  are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the treatment being evaluated 
even if we are able to reach agreement with the fda on a spa for an additional phase iii clinical trial evaluating the red blood cell system  we would only initiate such a trial if adequate funding can be secured 
additional information regarding our interactions with the fda  bpac and potential future clinical development of the intercept blood system in the united states design can be found under item a risk factors of this annual report on form k  under the risk factor titled our products  blood products treated with the intercept blood system and we are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign authorities 
if our preclinical and clinical data are not considered sufficient by a country s regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval  we will be unable to commercialize our products and generate revenue in that country 
our red blood cell system requires extensive additional testing and development 
information regarding our revenues for the years ended december   and can be found in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and item a exhibits and financial statement schedules financial statements of this annual report on form k 
intercept blood system technology both our platelet system and plasma system employ the same technology 
platelet or plasma components collected from blood donors are transferred into plastic intercept disposable kits and are mixed with our proprietary compound  amotosalen  which has an affinity for nucleic acid 
the disposable kits are then placed in an illumination device  or illuminator  where the mixture is exposed to ultra violet a  or uva  light 
if pathogens such as viruses  bacteria or parasites are present in the platelet or 
table of contents plasma components  the energy from the uva light causes the amotosalen to bond with the nucleic acid of the pathogens 
the ability of amotosalen to form both cross links between strands of nucleic acid and links to single nucleic acid strands results in a strong chemical bond between the amotosalen and the nucleic acid of the pathogens 
the presence of these bonds is designed to prevent replication of the nucleic acid within pathogens  effectively inactivating the pathogens 
a high level of inactivation has been demonstrated in a broad range of pathogens studied by us and others in laboratory testing 
for instance  intercept has demonstrated inactivation of a number of single stranded nucleic acid based viruses such as hiv  hepatitis b  hepatitis c using a model virus  west nile  chikungunya  and certain influenza viruses 
since platelets and plasma do not rely on nucleic acid for therapeutic efficacy  the intercept blood system is designed to preserve the therapeutic function of the platelet and plasma components when used in human transfusions 
following the inactivation process  residual amotosalen and by products are reduced by more than through use of a compound adsorption device  which is an integrated component of the disposable kit 
we have performed extensive toxicology testing on the residual amotosalen and its by products and good safety margins have been demonstrated 
any remaining amotosalen which may be transfused is rapidly excreted by humans 
leukocytes  also known as white blood cells  are typically present in platelet and plasma components collected for transfusion and can cause adverse transfusion reactions as well as an often fatal disease called graft versus host disease 
leukocytes  like pathogens  rely on nucleic acid for replication and cellular function 
the intercept blood system  with its combination of the amotosalen and uva light  is designed to inactivate leukocytes in the same manner it inactivates pathogens 
like the platelet and plasma systems  the red blood cell system acts by using an additive compound to form bonds with nucleic acid in pathogens that may be present in donated red blood cell collections 
the red blood cell system is designed to preserve the therapeutic qualities of the red blood cells  which like platelets and plasma  do not rely on nucleic acid for their cellular function 
the red blood cell system uses another of our proprietary compounds  s unlike the platelet and plasma systems  the chemical bonds from s are not triggered by uva light  but instead  by the ph level of the red blood cell components 
after mixture with the red blood cell components in plastic disposable kits  s is designed to rapidly break down into a form that is no longer chemically reactive with nucleic acid 
as with the platelet and plasma systems  a high level of inactivation in a broad range of pathogens has been demonstrated with the red blood cell system in the clinical setting 
by treating blood components with intercept within a day of collection  the inactivation of bacteria prevents bacterial growth that could create increased risk of inflammatory response or dangerous levels of endotoxins 
extensive clinical testing has been done on platelet and plasma products treated with the intercept blood system  as well as post marketing haemovigilance studies of the treated blood products in routine use 
we believe that  due to their mechanisms of action  the platelet system  plasma system  and red blood cell system will potentially inactivate blood borne pathogens that have not yet been tested with our systems  including emerging and future threats to the blood supply 
we do not claim  however  that our intercept blood system will inactivate all pathogens  including prions  and our inactivation claims are limited to those contained in our product specifications 
collaborations baxter international  inc and fenwal  inc 
we collaborated with baxter international  inc  or baxter  on the development and commercialization of the intercept blood system commencing in we obtained exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to the red blood cell system from baxter in february in february  we entered into a restructuring of our agreements with baxter pursuant to which we obtained exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to the 
table of contents platelet and plasma systems  excluding certain asian countries where the commercialization rights had been licensed to bioone corporation  or bioone 
we also agreed to pay baxter royalties on future intercept blood system product sales at royalty rates that vary by product of product sales for the platelet system  of product sales for the plasma system  of product sales for the red blood cell system  and on sales of uva illuminators 
in march  baxter sold its transfusion therapies business  the unit of baxter that has performed many of the manufacturing and supply chain activities related to our relationship with baxter  to fenwal  inc  or fenwal 
fenwal has assumed baxter s rights and obligations under our agreements 
bioone in june  we and baxter entered into a definitive agreement with bioone  which we refer to as the agreement  for the commercialization of our platelet system in specified parts of asia 
in june  we and baxter entered into a definitive agreement with bioone  which we refer to as the agreement  for the commercialization of our plasma system in specified parts of asia 
under the terms of both the agreement and agreement  bioone was responsible for seeking regulatory approvals for and commercializing the platelet and plasma system in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  thailand  vietnam and singapore 
under those agreements  bioone received exclusive marketing and distribution rights in each of those countries 
in march  baxter transferred its rights and obligations with regard to bioone to fenwal 
in august  we completed an acquisition of certain assets of bioone  including the commercialization rights that both fenwal and we granted to bioone for both the platelet and plasma systems 
concurrent with the acquisition  fenwal and we terminated the commercialization rights that we and fenwal had granted to bioone 
as a consequence of the termination  and pursuant to a pre existing agreement with fenwal  our commercialization rights to the platelet and plasma systems under our and agreements with baxter became worldwide 
as consideration for the acquired bioone assets  we relinquished all shares we held in bioone valued at approximately million and issued  shares of our common stock to bioone valued at approximately million  of which  shares were issued at the close of the acquisition on august  and the remaining  shares were issued six months from the close of the acquisition date on february  united states armed forces in february  we were awarded a cooperative agreement with the army medical research acquisition activity division of the department of defense  or dod 
in total  we have been awarded an aggregate of million under awards and cooperative agreements with the dod  all of which were for the continued funding of projects to develop our pathogen inactivation technologies for the improved safety and availability of blood that may be used by the united states armed forces for medical transfusions 
under the terms of the cooperative agreements  we are conducting research on the inactivation of infectious pathogens in blood  including unusual viruses  bacteria and parasites that are of concern to the united states armed forces 
this funding supports advanced development of our red blood cell system 
investment in aduro biotech in november  we spun off our former immunotherapy business to anza therapeutics  inc  or anza therapeutics 
in exchange for our contribution of tangible and intangible assets to anza therapeutics  we received preferred stock representing an equity interest of approximately of anza therapeutics preferred equity 
we were informed in february that anza therapeutics had ceased operations 
in july  we entered into a three way license agreement with anza therapeutics and aduro biotech  or aduro  and separate agreements with each of anza therapeutics and aduro  which we refer to collectively as the assignment agreements 
in november  anza therapeutics transferred all of its intellectual property to aduro pursuant to the terms of the assignment agreements 
in exchange for agreeing to the transfer and relinquishing our shares in anza therapeutics and releasing any claims against anza therapeutics  we received 
table of contents million in cash  preferred stock representing of aduro s capital  and a royalty fee on any future sales resulting from the transferred technology 
in april  aduro completed a subsequent round of financing  issuing series b preferred stock and as a result  reduced our ownership in aduro to less than 
since receiving preferred stock in aduro  we have carried our investment in aduro at zero on our consolidated balance sheet as we have no basis to believe that we will receive any economic benefit from our equity ownership in aduro as we believed that aduro s technology platforms  which were largely based on anza therapeutics in process development programs  had a high risk of failure 
william greenman  our president and chief executive officer  is on the board of directors of aduro 
mr 
greenman does not represent cerus on aduro s board of directors 
manufacturing and supply we are responsible for the full management and control of the supply chain for the intercept illuminators and certain other components of the platelet and plasma disposable kits 
we have used  and intend to continue to use  third parties to manufacture and supply the devices  disposable kits and inactivation compounds that make up the intercept blood system for use in clinical trials and for commercialization 
we rely solely on fenwal for the manufacture of intercept blood system disposable kits and on contract manufacturers for the production of inactivation compounds  compound adsorption components of the disposable kits and uva illuminators used in the intercept blood system 
we currently do not have alternate manufacturers for the components in our products beyond those that we currently rely on 
in december  we amended our manufacturing and supply agreement with fenwal 
under the amended agreement  fenwal is obligated to sell  and we are obligated to purchase  finished disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems for both clinical and commercial use 
the agreement permits us to purchase platelet and plasma kits from third party manufacturers provided that we meet certain annual minimum purchase obligations to fenwal 
we are responsible for developing and delivering to fenwal our proprietary inactivation compounds and adsorption media for incorporation into the final system configuration 
the term of the amended manufacturing and supply agreement with fenwal extends through december   and is automatically renewed for one year terms  subject to termination by either party upon thirty months prior written notice  in the case of fenwal  or twenty four months prior written notice  in our case 
we and fenwal each have normal and customary termination rights  including termination for material breach 
components of compound adsorption devices used in platelet and plasma disposable kits are manufactured by porex corporation  or porex 
in  we and porex entered into an agreement for the manufacture of such components  which expires in december we do not currently have alternate manufacturers validated for the manufacture of compound adsorption devices and will need to either identify and validate alternate suppliers for the manufacture of compound adsorption devices or agree with porex on either an amended supply agreement or new agreement 
we also have contracts with suppliers of raw materials used to make the compound adsorption devices  which includes such companies as brotech corporation d b a purolite company  or purolite 
we entered into the supplier agreement with purolite in  which extends through december  and will automatically renew each year  unless terminated by either party upon providing at least two year prior written notice 
pursuant to a contract that we and nova biomedical corporation  or nova  entered into in september  nova has begun manufacturing illuminators for us 
the term of the nova agreement extends through september and is automatically renewable for one year terms  subject to termination by either party upon twelve months prior written notice 
in september  we amended our manufacturing and supply agreement with ash stevens  inc  or ash stevens  for the synthesis of amotosalen  the inactivation compound used in our platelet and plasma systems 
under this amended agreement  we are not subject to minimum annual purchase requirements 
however  if specified quantities of amotosalen are not purchased in any year  we are required to pay a maintenance fee of up 
table of contents to  for such year 
in the past  we have incurred these penalties 
the term of the amended manufacturing and supply agreement with ash stevens extends through december  and will automatically renew thereafter for a period of two years  unless terminated by either party upon providing at least one year prior written notice  in our case  or at least two years prior written notice  in the case of ash stevens 
we and our contract manufacturers  including fenwal and nova  purchase certain raw materials for our disposable kits  inactivation compounds  materials and parts associated with compound adsorption devices and uva illuminators from a limited number of suppliers 
some of our suppliers require minimum annual purchase amounts 
while we believe that there are alternative sources of supply for such materials  parts and devices  we have not validated or qualified any alternate manufacturers 
as such  establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the raw materials  parts and devices  if required  will likely not be accomplished quickly and could involve significant additional costs and potential regulatory reviews 
marketing  sales and distribution the market for the intercept blood system is dominated by a relatively small number of blood collection organizations 
many of these organizations are national blood transfusion services or red cross organizations who collect  store and distribute virtually all of their respective nations blood and blood component supplies 
the largest european markets for our products are in germany  france  and england 
in germany  decisions on product adoption are made on a regional or blood center by blood center basis 
while obtaining ce marks allow us to sell the platelet and plasma systems to blood centers in germany  blood centers in germany must still obtain both local manufacturing approval and national marketing authorization from the paul ehrlich institute before being allowed to sell platelet and plasma components treated with the intercept blood system to transfusing hospitals and physicians 
to date  several blood centers in germany have received such requisite approvals and authorizations for the platelet system and or the plasma system 
in france  broad product adoption is dependent on a central decision by the etablissement francais du sang  or efs  and then on a broad based national supply contract being awarded 
in  we entered into a two year contract with the efs to supply platelet and plasma disposable kits 
the contract contains two one year renewal options and provides for minimum and maximum purchase commitments 
in england  decisions on product adoption are centralized in the national blood service 
we understand that the national blood service has decided to implement bacterial detection testing for platelets before considering pathogen inactivation 
our ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement for product costs and related treatment of blood components from governmental authorities and private health care insurers including health maintenance organizations  which are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both the extent of coverage and the reimbursement rate for new tests and treatments 
we maintain a wholly owned subsidiary  cerus europe bv  headquartered in the netherlands  which focuses its efforts on marketing and selling the intercept blood system in a number of countries in europe  the cis  the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world 
we also have a small scientific affairs group in the united states and the netherlands that supports the commercialization efforts 
competition we believe that the intercept blood system has certain competitive advantages over competing blood borne pathogen inactivation methods that are either on the market or in development 
the intercept blood system is designed for use in blood centers  which allows for integration with current blood collection  processing and storage procedures 
certain competing products currently on the market  such as solvent 
table of contents detergent treated plasma  use centralized processing that takes blood products away from the blood center in order to be treated at a central facility before being shipped back out to the blood centers or hospitals for ultimate transfusion 
in europe  several companies  including grifols sa  octapharma ag and macopharma international  are developing or selling commercial pathogen inactivation systems or services to treat fresh frozen plasma 
caridianbct becoming terumobct has developed a pathogen inactivation system for blood products and has been issued ce marks for a pathogen reduction system for both platelets and plasma 
we understand that caridianbct is also developing a pathogen inactivation system for whole blood 
in addition to direct competition from other pathogen inactivation methods  we encounter indirect competition from other approaches to blood safety  including methods of testing blood products for bacterial and viral pathogens 
some of these indirect competitors have mature  well established products and more resources than we have 
further discussion of the major competitors to our blood product business can be found under item a risk factors of this annual report on form k  under the risk factor entitled if our competitors develop superior products to ours or market their products more effectively than we market our products  our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in the market for pathogen inactivation of blood products include the breadth and effectiveness of pathogen inactivation processes  the amount of demonstrated reduction in transfusion related adverse events subsequent to adopting pathogen inactivation technology  robustness of treated blood components upon transfusion  ease of use  the scope and enforceability of patent or other proprietary rights  product value relative to perceived risk  product supply and marketing and sales capability 
in addition  we believe the length of time required for products to be developed and to receive regulatory and  in some cases  reimbursement approval are also important competitive factors 
we believe that the intercept blood system will compete favorably with respect to these factors  although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
our success will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes and customer demand through the development and introduction of new products 
patents  licenses and proprietary rights our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents  to protect trade secrets  to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
as of december   we owned approximately issued or allowed united states patents and approximately issued or allowed foreign patents related to the intercept blood system 
our patents expire at various dates between and in addition  we have pending united states patent applications and have filed corresponding patent applications under the patent cooperation treaty 
we have a license from fenwal to united states and foreign patents relating to the intercept blood system  which expire at various dates between and proprietary rights relating to our planned and potential products will be protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
seasonality our business is dependent on the marketing and commercialization of the intercept blood system to customers such as blood banks  hospitals  distributors and other health care providers that have a need for a pathogen inactivation system to treat blood products for transfusion 
since our customers needs are not based on seasonal trends  seasonality does not have a material effect on our business 
inventory requirements and product return rights our platelet and plasma systems have received regulatory approval for two year shelf lives 
illuminators and replacement parts do not have regulated expiration dates 
we own work in process inventory for certain 
table of contents components of intercept disposable kits  finished intercept disposable kits  illuminators  and certain replacement parts for our illuminators 
our supply chain for certain of these components  held as work in process on our consolidated balance sheet  may potentially take over one year to complete production before being utilized in finished disposable kits 
we maintain an inventory balance based on our current sales projections  and at each reporting period  we evaluate whether our work in process inventory would be consumed for production of finished units in order to sell to existing and prospective customers within the next twelve month period 
it is not customary for our production cycle for inventory to exceed twelve months 
instead  we use our best judgment to factor in lead times for the production of our finished units to meet our current demands 
if actual results differ from those estimates  work in process inventory could potentially accumulate for periods exceeding one year 
inventory is recorded at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market value 
we use significant judgment to analyze and determine if the composition of our inventory is obsolete  slow moving  or unsalable and frequently review such determinations 
our limited history and limited experience with manufacturing and selling the intercept blood system limits the amount of historical data we have to perform such analysis 
generally  we write down specifically identified obsolete  slow moving  or known unsalable inventory that has no alternative use to net realizable value in the period that it is first recognized  by using a number of factors  including product expiration dates  open and unfulfilled orders  and sales forecasts 
the write down of our inventory to net realizable value establishes a new cost basis and will be maintained even if certain circumstances suggest that the inventory is recoverable in subsequent periods 
we sell the intercept blood system directly to blood banks  hospitals  universities  and government agencies  as well as to distributors in certain regions 
generally  our contracts with our customers do not provide for open return rights  except within a reasonable time after receipt of goods in the case of defective or non conforming product 
customers and financial information about geographic areas at december   we had two customers that each accounted for more than of our outstanding trade receivables  which cumulatively represented approximately of our outstanding trade receivables 
in addition  we had three significant customers that each accounted for more than of our total product revenue  which cumulatively represented of our total product revenue and of our total product revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  while we had four significant customers that each accounted for more than of our total product revenue  which cumulatively represented of our total product revenue for the year ended december  the loss of any one of these customers would have an adverse impact on our business 
to date  we have not experienced collection difficulties from these customers 
for additional details about these customers for the years ended december   and  as well as information regarding our net revenues by geographical location and location of our long lived assets  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item a consolidated financial statements and supplementary data financial statements financial statements of this annual report on form k 
research and development expenses a significant portion of our operating expenses is related to research and development and we intend to maintain our strong commitment to research and development 
we have incurred total research and development expenses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item a consolidated financial statements and supplementary data financial statements of this annual report on form k for costs and expenses related to research and development  and other financial information for the years ended december   and government regulation we and our products are comprehensively regulated in the united states by the fda and  in some instances  by state and local governments  and by comparable governmental authorities in other countries 

table of contents our european investigational plan has been based on the intercept blood system being categorized as class iii drug device combinations under the medical device directives  or the mdd  of the european union 
the european union requires that medical devices affix the ce mark  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with the mdd 
we initially received the ce mark for our platelet system and separately for our plasma system in and  respectively 
we will need to obtain a ce mark extension in our name from european union regulators for both our platelet and plasma systems every five years 
the ce mark for the platelet system is effective through may while the ce mark for the plasma system is effective through september a separate ce mark certification must be received for the red blood cell system to be sold in the european union and in other countries recognizing the ce mark 
in addition  france  switzerland  germany  and austria require separate approvals for intercept treated blood products 
the fda regulates drugs  medical devices and biologics under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and other laws  including  in the case of biologics  the public health service act 
these laws and implementing regulations govern  among other things  the development  testing  manufacturing  record keeping  storage  labeling  advertising  promotion and pre market clearance or approval of products subject to regulation 
the steps required before a medical device may be approved for marketing in the united states pursuant to a pma include preclinical laboratory and animal tests  submission to the fda of an investigational device exemption for human clinical testing  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  appropriate tests to show the product s safety  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the product s safety and efficacy for its intended indications  submission to the fda of a pma  and fda review of the pma in order to determine  among other things  whether the product is safe and effective for its intended uses 
the fda will require a pma for each of the intercept systems for platelets  plasma and red blood cells because the fda considers the intercept blood system a biological medical device 
the fda center for biologics evaluation and research  or cber  is principally responsible for regulating the intercept blood system 
however  before the fda determines whether to approve our blood safety products  we expect our pma to be reviewed by the blood products advisory committee  or bpac  an advisory committee convened by and reporting to the fda 
should the fda ask questions to bpac  we expect bpac will answer those questions and make recommendations to the fda 
in order to support our pma for the intercept blood system  we have conducted various types of studies  including toxicology studies to evaluate product safety  laboratory and animal studies to evaluate product effectiveness and human clinical trials to evaluate the safety  tolerability and effectiveness of treated blood components 
since assuming responsibility for regulatory approval of the intercept blood system in the united states in  we have used the same modular process for our pma application for the platelet system that baxter had used in the united states 
the content  order and submission timing of the modules must be approved by the fda  and a modular pma application cannot be approved until all modules have been submitted to  reviewed by and accepted by the fda 
we completed a phase iii clinical trial of the platelet system in the united states in march and a supplemental analysis of data from this trial in we submitted this information along with several other modules of our pma  to the fda 
the fda has indicated that the clinical trial data and supplemental analysis are not sufficient to support a pma and we will therefore need to conduct and complete an additional phase iii clinical trial before we can complete our regulatory submission to the fdal 
in november  we and the fda 
table of contents presented a proposed clinical trial protocol for a second phase iii clinical trial for platelets to the bpac 
the outcome of that meeting was the support for the design and endpoints of a clinical trial for intercept treated platelets  subject to changes regarding the sensitivity of the safety endpoint 
we are currently in discussions with the fda regarding further details of the proposed additional phase iii clinical trial 
currently  we have no plans to initiate such a clinical trial unless adequate funding can be secured 
we have completed phase iiia  phase iiib and phase iiic clinical trials of the plasma system in the united states  reports for which were filed with the fda during we have not submitted any applications for regulatory approval of the plasma system in the united states 
intercept treated plasma was recently granted orphan drug status by the fda office of orphan products development for the treatment of ttp 
although we have completed phase iii clinical trials in this patient population  the fda may require supportive supplemental data collected in commercial use in ttp patients receiving intercept treated plasma in europe  or they may require us to complete additional phase iii clinical trials  before approval would be granted 
we are seeking clarity on the clinical pathway with the fda  and we do not yet know if the fda will require any additional clinical trials 
if additional clinical trials are required for approval  we will likely only initiate such trials if adequate funding can be secured 
the fda inspects the facilities at which products are manufactured and will not permit clinical studies with a product or approve a product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice or quality system regulation requirements is satisfactory 
the facilities of the principal third party suppliers that manufacture our products are not currently fda qualified 
in addition to regulating our blood safety products  cber also regulates the blood collection centers and the blood products that they prepare using the intercept blood system 
if our products were to be approved by the fda  us based blood centers will be required to obtain site specific licenses prior to engaging in interstate transport of blood components processed using the intercept blood system 
any delay in obtaining these licenses would adversely impact our ability to sell products in the united states 
we believe that  in deciding whether the intercept blood system is safe and effective  regulatory authorities have taken  and are expected to take  into account whether it adversely affects the therapeutic efficacy of blood components as compared to the therapeutic efficacy of blood components not treated with the system 
data from human clinical studies must demonstrate the safety of treated blood components and their therapeutic comparability to untreated blood components 
in addition  regulatory authorities will weigh the system s safety  including potential toxicities of the inactivation compounds  and other risks against the benefits of using the system in a blood supply that has become safer 
we have conducted many toxicology studies designed to demonstrate the intercept blood system s safety 
there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not require further toxicology or other studies of our products 
based on discussions with the fda and european regulatory authorities  we believe that data only from laboratory and animal studies  not data from human clinical studies  will be required to demonstrate the system s efficacy in inactivating pathogens 
in light of these criteria  our clinical trial programs for the intercept blood system consist of studies that differ from typical phase i  phase ii and phase iii clinical studies 
the intercept blood system for red blood cells preclinical and clinical studies have been conducted using prototype system disposables and devices 
in addition to the clinical trials  a number of manufacturing and validation activities must be completed before we could sell the red blood cell product 
further discussion of our regulatory and clinical trial status can be found in under item a risk factors of this annual report on form k  under the risk factor titled our products  blood products treated with the intercept blood system and we are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign authorities 
if our preclinical and clinical data are not considered sufficient by a country s regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval  we will be unable to commercialize our products and generate revenue in that country 
our red blood cell system requires extensive additional testing and development 

table of contents health care reimbursement and reform our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of the products and related treatment are obtained 
the recent united states healthcare reform act and ongoing cost saving efforts in the united states and in other regions of the world may have an impact on our ability to profitably commercialize the intercept blood system in the united states and elsewhere 
employees as of december   we had employees  of whom were engaged in research and development and in selling  general and administrative activities 
of the employees engaged in selling  general  and administrative activities  were employed by our european subsidiary  cerus europe bv none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

item a 
risk factors our business faces significant risks 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs  our business may suffer  the trading price of our common stock could decline and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
there may be additional risks faced by our business 
other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
the intercept blood system may not achieve broad market acceptance 
we must address issues and concerns from broad constituencies involved in the healthcare system  from blood centers to patients  transfusing physicians  hospitals  private and public sector payors  regulatory bodies and public health authorities 
we may be unable to demonstrate to these constituencies that the intercept blood system is safe  effective and economical or that the benefits of using the intercept blood system products justify their cost 
use of the platelet system results in some processing loss of platelets 
if the loss of platelets leads to increased costs for our customers  our customers or prospective customers believe that the loss of platelet reduces the efficacy of the transfusion unit  or our process requires changes in blood center or clinical regimens  prospective customers may not adopt our platelet system 
certain studies have indicated that transfusion of conventionally prepared platelets may yield higher post transfusion platelet counts according to a measurement 
table of contents called corrected count increment and may be more effective than transfusion of intercept treated platelets 
while certain studies also demonstrate that intercept treated platelets retain therapeutic function comparable to conventional platelets  customers may choose not to adopt our platelet system due to considerations relating to corrected count increment or efficacy 
the intercept blood system does not inactivate all known pathogens  and the inability of the intercept blood system to inactivate certain pathogens may limit its market acceptance 
for example  due to the biology of certain non lipid enveloped viruses  including the hepatitis a virus  our products have not been demonstrated to be effective in the inactivation of these viruses 
in addition  for human parvovirus b  which is also a non lipid enveloped virus  our testing has not demonstrated a high level of inactivation 
although we have shown high levels of inactivation of a broad spectrum of lipid enveloped viruses  some customers may choose not to adopt our products based on considerations concerning inability to inactivate  or limited inactivation  of certain non lipid enveloped viruses 
similarly  although our product has been demonstrated to effectively inactivate spore forming bacteria  our products have not been shown to be effective in inactivating bacterial spores  once formed 
in addition  since prions do not contain nucleic acid  our products do not inactivate prions 
while transmission of prions has not been a major problem in blood transfusions  and we are not aware of any competing products that inactivate prions  the inability to inactivate prions may limit market acceptance of our products 
we have conducted studies of our products in both in vitro and in vivo environments using well established tests that are accepted by regulatory bodies 
when an in vitro test was not generally available or not well established  we conducted in vivo studies in mammalian models to predict human responses 
although we have no reason to believe that the in vitro and in vivo studies are not predictive of actual results in humans  we cannot be certain that the results of these in vitro and in vivo studies accurately predict the actual results in humans in all cases 
to the extent that actual results in human patients differs from the results of our in vitro or in vivo testing  market acceptance of our products may be negatively impacted 
furthermore  due to limitations of detective tests  we cannot exclude that a sufficient quantity of pathogen or pathogens may still be present in active form which could present a risk of infection to the transfused patient 
such uncertainty may limit the market acceptance of our products 
if customers experience operational or technical problems with the use of intercept blood system products  market acceptance may be reduced 
for example  if adverse events arise from incomplete inactivation of pathogens  improper processing or user error  or if testing of intercept treated blood samples fails to reliably confirm pathogen inactivation  whether or not directly attributable to the intercept blood system  customers may refrain from purchasing the products 
in addition  there is a risk that further studies we or others may conduct will show results inconsistent with previous studies 
should this happen  potential customers may delay or choose not to adopt our products  and existing customers may cease use of our products 
market acceptance of our products is affected by blood center budgets and the availability of reimbursement from governments  managed care payors  such as insurance companies  or other third parties 
in many cases  due to the structure of the blood products industry  we will have little control over budget and reimbursement discussions  which generally occur between blood centers and national or regional ministries of health and private payors 
even if a particular blood center is prepared to adopt the intercept blood system  their hospital customers may not accept  or may not have the budget to purchase  intercept treated blood products 
since blood centers would likely not eliminate the practice of screening donors or testing blood for pathogens prior to transfusion  even after implementing our products some blood centers may not be able to identify enough cost offsets to afford to purchase our products 
budgetary concerns may be further exacerbated by the economic austerity programs implemented in european countries  which may limit the adoption of new technologies  including our products 
furthermore  it is difficult to predict the reimbursement status of newly approved  novel medical device products 
in certain countries  governments have issued regulations relating to the pricing and profitability of medical products and medical products companies 
health care reform in the united states has also placed downward pressure on the pricing of medical products 

table of contents product adoption in europe and other regions may be negatively affected because we do not have united states food and drug administration  or fda  approval for any of our products 
in addition  if we do not achieve widespread product adoption in key european countries  adoption in other countries may be affected 
the market for the intercept blood system is highly concentrated with few customers  including often dominant regional or national blood collection entities 
even if our products receive regulatory approval and reimbursement is available  failure to effectively market  promote  distribute  price or sell our products to any of these large customers could significantly delay or even diminish potential product revenue in those geographies 
the market for our pathogen inactivation systems in the united states is highly concentrated  dominated by a small number of blood collection organizations 
in many countries in western europe and in japan  various national blood transfusion services or red cross organizations collect  store and distribute virtually all of their respective nations blood and blood components supply 
in europe  the largest markets for our products are in germany  france  and england 
in germany  decisions on product adoption and subsequent reimbursement are made on a regional or even blood center by blood center basis  but depend on both local approvals and centralized regulatory approvals from the paul ehrlich institute  or pei 
product characteristics relating to platelet dose of intercept treated platelets that have received marketing authorization from the pei may be incompatible with market requirements 
some potential customers may await further safety information or additional studies before choosing whether to adopt our products 
customers or prospective customers may conduct and complete their own clinical trials before adopting our products 
for instance  we understand that the largest group of blood centers in germany will not purchase our products on a routine basis until and unless that group completes a clinical trial using our products 
we cannot predict the final trial design  number of transfusions  enrollment duration  estimated time it will take to complete such a trial  or trial outcome 
while intercept treated platelets and plasma have received in country regulatory approval and reimbursement rates have been established in france  adoption throughout france has been limited to certain blood centers 
decisions on product adoption in england are centralized with the national blood service and we understand that the national blood service has decided to implement bacterial detection testing for platelets before considering pathogen inactivation 
the japanese red cross controls a significant majority of blood transfusions in japan and exerts a high degree of influence on the adoption and use of blood safety measures in japan 
the japanese red cross has been reviewing preclinical and clinical data on pathogen inactivation of blood over a number of years and has yet to make a formal determination to adopt any pathogen inactivation approach 
we understand that the japanese red cross has begun formal evaluation of a competing technology 
before the japanese red cross considers our products  we understand that we may need to commit to making certain product configuration changes in order to allow the intercept blood system to integrate with the collection platforms of the japanese red cross 
adverse market and economic conditions may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business 
sales of our products are dependent on reimbursement from government health administration authorities  distribution partners and other organizations 
as a result of adverse conditions affecting the global economies and credit and financial markets  including the current sovereign debt crisis in certain countries in europe and disruptions due to political instability or otherwise  these organizations may be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations  or may delay payment for the intercept blood system 
in addition  political and economic instability in europe may diminish the value of the euro  which could reduce our reported product revenue 

table of contents our products  blood products treated with the intercept blood system and we are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign authorities 
if our preclinical and clinical data are not considered sufficient by a country s regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval  we will be unable to commercialize our products and generate revenue in that country 
our red blood cell system requires extensive additional testing and development 
our products  both those sold commercially and those under development are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by local  state and federal regulatory authorities in the united states and by foreign regulatory bodies 
these regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things development  testing  manufacturing  labeling  storage  pre market clearance or approval  sales and distribution  use standards and documentation  post launch surveillance  quality  advertising and promotion  and reimbursement 
our products must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy and we must adhere to quality standards regarding manufacturing and customer facing business processes before the fda and international regulatory authorities can approve them for commercial use 
for our product candidates  we must provide the fda and international regulatory authorities with preclinical  clinical and manufacturing data demonstrating that our products are safe  effective and in compliance with government regulations before the products can be approved for commercial sale 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive and uncertain  and typically takes a number of years 
we may continue to encounter significant delays or excessive costs in our efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses  or we may not be successful at all 
clinical trials are particularly expensive and have a high risk of failure 
any of our product candidates may fail in the testing phase or may not achieve results sufficient to attain market acceptance  which could prevent us from achieving profitability 
we do not know whether we will begin and conduct planned clinical trials on schedule  if at all 
significant delays in clinical testing could materially impact our clinical trials 
criteria for regulatory approval in blood safety indications are evolving with competitive advances in the standard of care against which new product candidates are judged  as well as with changing market needs and reimbursement levels 
clinical trial design  including enrollment criteria  endpoints  and anticipated label claims are thus subject to change  even if original objectives are being met 
in addition to the reasons stated above  clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons  including delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a study  delays in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical study agreement terms with prospective clinical sites  delays in obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a study at a prospective clinical site and delays in recruiting subjects to participate in a study 
we do not know whether any clinical trials will result in marketable products 
typically  there is a high rate of failure for product candidates in preclinical and clinical trials and products emerging from any successful trial may not reach the market for several years 
enrollment criteria for certain of our clinical trials may be quite narrow 
for instance  clinical trials previously conducted using intercept treated plasma for patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 
table of contents lasted approximately four years due in part  to the difficulties associated with enrolling qualified patients 
consequently  we may be unable to recruit suitable patients into clinical trials on a timely basis  if at all 
we cannot rely on interim results of trials to predict their final results  and acceptable results in early trials might not be repeated in later trials 
any trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the fda or foreign regulatory authorities 
in addition  preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
negative or inconclusive results from a preclinical study or clinical trial or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a preclinical study or clinical trial to be repeated  require other studies to be performed or cause a program to be terminated  even if other studies or trials relating to a program are successful 
outside the united states  regulations vary by country  including the requirements for approvals or clearance to market  the time required for regulatory review and the sanctions imposed for violations 
in addition to ce mark documentation  countries outside the european union may require clinical data submissions  registration packages  import licenses or other documentation 
in may  we obtained a ce mark extension in our name from european union regulators for our platelet system and will need to obtain an extension every five years 
we or our customers may also be required to conduct additional testing in order to obtain regulatory approval in countries that do not recognize the ce mark as being adequate for commercializing the intercept blood system in those countries 
the level of additional product testing varies by country  but could be expensive or take a long time to complete 
in addition  regulatory agencies are able to withdraw or suspend previously issued approvals 
we completed our phase iii clinical trial of the platelet system in the united states in march and submitted data from this trial  along with several other modules of our pre market approval application  to the fda 
based on discussions with the fda  we performed an additional blinded analysis of the clinical trial data  under the direction of an independent expert physician panel  to determine if apparent differences between treatment groups in the category of pulmonary adverse events reported in the study were attributable to discrepancies in safety results 
the reassessment of primary patient records by the expert physician panel showed no statistically significant differences between groups 
this reassessment differed from the earlier analysis of adverse events that was based on clinical trial case report forms and had shown statistically significant differences in specific pulmonary events 
we submitted a report of the analysis to the fda for review 
we understand that our reassessment of our previously completed phase iii clinical trial data will not be sufficient to address the fda s questions 
in november  we and the fda presented a proposed clinical trial protocol for a second phase iii clinical trial for platelets to the fda s blood product advisory committee  or bpac 
although the bpac agreed with the proposed trial design  safety endpoints and efficacy endpoints  we believe we will need to reach agreement with the fda on the means necessary to satisfy the bpac s request for more stringent safety margins than we had proposed 
in order to meet the more stringent safety margins  we may need to enroll and collect data from more patients than what we had initially proposed to bpac 
until the final study size and design requirements are determined  we will not be able to assess the feasibility of a second phase iii clinical trial 
the dimensions of such a phase iii clinical trial may be prohibitive due either to prospective cost  availability of patients in the target population  or logistics 
we have no plans to initiate such a trial unless adequate funding is secured 
the additional phase iii clinical trial will need to be completed and data submitted to the fda before we can complete our regulatory submission 
in september  we obtained a ce mark extension in our name from european union regulators for our plasma system and final french approval of intercept treated plasma in may in february  the first approval for use of intercept treated plasma was obtained from the paul ehrlich institute by a blood center in germany 
in some countries  including several in europe  we or our customers may be required to perform additional clinical studies or submit manufacturing and marketing applications in order to obtain regulatory approval 
we have completed phase iiia  phase iiib and phase iiic clinical trials of the plasma system  in the united states  reports for which were filed with the fda during we have not submitted any applications for 
table of contents regulatory approval of the plasma system in the united states or any other regions other than in europe 
intercept treated plasma was recently granted orphan drug status by the fda office of orphan products development for the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 
although we have completed phase iii clinical trials in this patient population  the fda may require us to compile supplemental data collected from commercial use in europe or to complete additional phase iii clinical trials before approval would be granted 
should the fda require us to complete additional clinical trials  we will likely need to secure adequate funding before we would initiate any such trials 
before the fda determines whether to approve the intercept blood system products  we expect our approval applications to be reviewed by bpac 
should the fda ask bpac questions  we expect bpac to answer those questions and make recommendations to the fda 
even if bpac were to recommend approval of one or more of our products  the fda would not necessarily have to approve those products 
if bpac were to answer fda questions recommending against approval of one or more of our products  the fda would have to take into consideration the points of concern raised by bpac which could affect the approval of the products 
if our product candidates receive approval for commercial sale in the united states  their marketing and manufacturing will be subject to continuing fda and other regulatory requirements  such as requirements to comply with good manufacturing practice  or gmp  and iso  a quality management system standard applicable to the products we sell in europe 
the failure to comply with these requirements on an ongoing basis could result in delaying or precluding commercialization efforts in certain geographies  including the united states  and could result in an enforcement action  which could harm our business 
the current manufacturing sites we rely upon for producing the platelet and plasma system products for international distribution and sale are not fda qualified facilities 
it will require both time and expense to obtain such qualification 
the fda will require  and other regulatory authorities may also require  a post marketing clinical study  which can involve significant expense 
governments or regulatory authorities may impose new regulations or other changes or we may discover that we are subject to additional regulations that could further delay or preclude regulatory approval and subsequent adoption of our potential products 
we cannot predict the impact of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action 
we have conducted many toxicology studies to demonstrate the intercept platelet and plasma systems safety  and we have conducted and plan to conduct toxicology studies for the intercept red blood cell system throughout the product development process 
at any time  the fda and other regulatory authorities may require further toxicology or other studies to further demonstrate our products safety  which could delay commercialization 
in addition  the fda or foreign regulatory authorities may alter guidance at any time as to what constitutes acceptable clinical trial endpoints or trial design  which may necessitate a redesign of our product or proposed clinical trials and cause us to incur substantial additional expense or time in attempting to gain regulatory approval 
we believe the fda and other regulatory authorities are likely to weigh the potential risks of using our pathogen inactivation products against the incremental benefits  which may be difficult or impossible to quantify 
we expect the fda will require us to demonstrate a very low level of potential side effects in the proposed second phase iii trial of the platelet system 
as a result of the termination of phase iii clinical trials of our red blood cell system due to the detection of antibody reactivity to red blood cells treated with the intercept red blood cell system in two patients in the chronic arm of the trials  we have been conducting additional research and development activities on our red blood cell system to reduce the potential for antibody reactivity to treated red blood cells 
based upon an internal evaluation of the results from these additional research activities as well as additional in vitro and in vivo studies and after consulting with regulatory authorities  we initiated a new phase i clinical trial in the fourth quarter of to test modifications to the red blood cell system 
that new phase i clinical trial was completed in early  successfully meeting our primary endpoint of red cell recovery measured twenty four hours after transfusion 
in addition to red cell recovery  we also measured red cell lifespan  measured as the half life of red cells circulating in transfusion recipients 
intercept treated red blood cells fell within the established normal reference range for red blood cells 
non treated red cells were above the established normal reference range 

table of contents we plan to initiate a phase iii clinical trial for acute anemia patients in europe upon acceptance the proposed clinical trial application by european regulators 
we are also planning to prepare a clinical trial application for a phase iii clinical trial for chronic anemia patients in europe 
we expect to conduct a further process validation study in europe prior to commencement of such trials 
we understand that the fda will likely require us to complete an additional recovery and lifespan study and at least one additional phase iii clinical trial before we would be able to potentially obtain approval for intercept treated red blood cells in the united states 
such studies could prolong development of the red blood cell program 
significantly lower lifespan for intercept treated red blood cells compared to non treated red blood cells may limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval for the product 
we also understand that the planned phase iii clinical trial in europe may be sufficient to receive ce mark but it would need to be supplemented by additional phase iii clinical trials for approval in certain countries in europe  including in france and germany 
these additional phase iii clinical trials will likely need to demonstrate equivalency of intercept treated red blood cells compared to conventional red blood cells 
a number of trial design issues that could impact efficacy  regulatory approval and market acceptance will need to be resolved prior to the initiation of further clinical trials 
we will also need to complete a number of in vitro studies  finalize development of the final commercial configuration of the red blood cell system and manufacture and validate sufficient quantities of the final red blood cell system prior to receiving regulatory approvals in europe or the united states 
many of these activities will require capital beyond that which we currently have 
if we are unsuccessful in advancing a modified red blood cell system through clinical trials  resolving process and product design issues or in obtaining subsequent regulatory approvals and acceptable reimbursement rates  we may never realize a return on our research and development expenses incurred to date in the red blood cell system program 
regulatory delays can also materially impact our product development costs 
if we experience delays in testing  conducting trials or approvals  our product development costs will increase 
regulatory agencies may limit the uses  or indications  for which any of our products are approved 
for example  we believe that the intercept blood system products will be able to claim the inactivation of particular pathogens only to the extent we have laboratory data to support such claims 
after regulatory approval for the initial indications  further studies may be necessary to gain approval for the use of the product for additional indications 
in addition to the regulatory requirements applicable to us and to our products  there are regulatory requirements in several countries around the world  including the united states  germany  canada  austria  and australia  and other countries  applicable to our prospective customers of intercept blood system products  the blood centers that process and distribute blood and blood products 
in those countries  blood centers and other customers are required to obtain approved license supplements from the appropriate regulatory authorities in each country before making available blood products processed with our pathogen inactivation systems to hospitals and transfusing physicians 
our customers may lack the resources or capability to obtain such regulatory approvals 
these requirements or regulators delays in approving license applications or supplements may deter some blood centers from using our products 
blood centers that do submit applications or supplements for manufacturing and sale may face disapproval or delays in approval that could provide further delay or deter them from using our products 
the regulatory impact on potential customers could slow or limit the potential sales of our products 
in august  in connection with our acquisition of certain assets from bioone  we regained the rights to commercialize the platelet and plasma systems in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  vietnam  thailand  and singapore 
regulatory authorities in these countries may require  among other requirements  that our platelet and plasma systems to be widely adopted commercially in europe or approved by the fda before the platelet and plasma systems are considered for approval 

table of contents we have limited experience operating a global commercial organization 
we rely on third parties to market  sell  distribute and maintain our products and to maintain customer relationships in certain countries 
we are responsible for sales  marketing  distribution  maintenance and regulatory support of the intercept blood system worldwide 
if we fail in our efforts to develop or maintain such internal competencies or establish acceptable relationships with third parties on a timely basis  our ability to commercialize the intercept blood system may be irreparably harmed 
we have a wholly owned subsidiary  headquartered in the netherlands  dedicated primarily to selling and marketing the platelet and plasma systems in geographies where the intercept platelet and plasma systems are approved or can be imported through the import license process 
we will need to maintain and continue to increase our competence in a number of functions  including sales  marketing  regulatory  inventory and logistics  customer service  credit and collections  risk management  and quality assurance systems 
many of these competencies require compliance with european union and local standards and practices  with which we have limited experience 
we have entered into distribution agreements  generally on a geographically exclusive basis  with distributors in countries where we have limited abilities to commercialize our products directly 
we rely on these distributors to obtain any necessary in country regulatory approvals  market and sell the intercept blood system  provide customer and technical product support  maintain inventories  and adhere to our quality system in all material respects  among other activities 
while our contracts generally require distributors to exercise diligence  these distributors may fail to commercialize the intercept blood system in their respective territories 
they may fail to sell product inventory they have purchased from us to end customers 
initial purchases of illuminators or disposable kits by these third parties may not lead to follow on purchases of disposable platelet and plasma system kits 
we have limited visibility into the identity and requirements of blood banking customers these distributors may have 
accordingly  we may be unable to ensure our distributors properly maintain illuminators sold or provide quality technical services to the blood banking customers to which they sell 
agreements with our distributors typically require the distributor to maintain quality standards that are compliant with standards generally accepted for medical devices 
we may be unable to ensure that our distributors are compliant with such standards 
distributors may irreparably harm relationships with local existing and prospective customers and our standing with the blood banking community in general 
we may have little recourse  short of termination  in the event that a distributor fails to execute according to our expectations and contractual provisions 
our manufacturing supply chain exposes us to significant risks 
intercept platelet and plasma disposable kits are manufactured and assembled by fenwal 
fenwal has agreed  through a supply agreement signed with us in december  to manufacture disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems for us 
after  fenwal may terminate the supply agreement  provided that fenwal shall have provided us thirty months prior notice of termination 
fenwal is our sole supplier for manufacture of these products 
fenwal may fail to manufacture an adequate supply of disposable kits or to do so on a cost effective basis  which would subject us to loss of revenue and reduced contribution margin if production of intercept disposable kits is produced at a facility that also produces fenwal branded products 
should production for fenwal s own products decline  our products may absorb more overhead  which would negatively impact our gross margins 
we also have contracts with independent suppliers  including ash stevens for the manufacture of amotosalen  our proprietary compound for inactivating pathogens  porex for the manufacture of components of the compound adsorption devices  and nova biomedical corporation  or nova  for the manufacture of illuminators and certain components of the intercept blood system 
these independent suppliers are our sole suppliers for such components 
our agreement with porex expires on december  prior to the expiration of that contract  we will need to negotiate an amendment or enter into a new contract with porex  or identify  validate and contract with an 
table of contents alternate supplier for such components of the compound adsorption devices 
failure to reach agreement with porex or an alternate supplier would impact our ability to manufacture intercept disposable kits and supply existing and prospective customers 
we also have contracts with other companies who are our sole suppliers of raw materials used to make compound adsorption devices 
facilities at which the intercept blood system or its components are manufactured may cease operations for planned or unplanned reasons  causing at least temporary interruptions in supply 
we do not have qualified suppliers beyond those on whom we currently rely  and we understand that fenwal relies substantially on sole suppliers of certain materials for our products 
if we need to or choose to identify and qualify alternate suppliers  the process will be time consuming and costly 
even a temporary failure to supply adequate numbers of intercept blood system components may cause an irreparable loss of customer goodwill 
if we conclude that supply of the intercept blood system or components from fenwal and others is uncertain  we may choose to build and maintain inventories of raw materials  work in process components  or finished goods  which would consume capital resources and may cause our supply chain to be less efficient 
currently  we have depleted our inventory of saleable illuminators and have instructed nova to begin manufacture of new illuminators to supply customer demand 
should nova have difficulties manufacturing sufficient quantities of illuminators in a timely manner  we may not be able to supply customer demand or provide replacement illuminators to existing customers 
some components of the illuminators are no longer manufactured  which will require us to identify and qualify replacement components and may require that we conduct additional studies  which could include clinical trials  to demonstrate equivalency or validate any required design or component changes 
future supply of illuminators is limited to availability of components  some of which are in short supply or are no longer manufactured 
we will likely need to redesign the illuminators used in the platelet and plasma systems 
such redesign may be expensive and lead to regulatory delays in obtaining approvals to market the redesigned device 
fenwal manufactures our platelet and plasma systems in facilities that are not fda approved 
in order to be used in clinical studies or sold in the united states  our products would be required to be manufactured in fda approved facilities 
fda validation of manufacturing facilities  whether owned by fenwal or by other parties  will be costly and time consuming 
if we attempt to establish alternate manufacturers  we will be dependent on fenwal to transfer know how relevant to the manufacture of the intercept blood system  however  certain of fenwal s materials  manufacturing processes and methods are proprietary to fenwal 
we may be unable to establish alternate sources of supply to fenwal  nova  or other suppliers without having to redesign certain elements of the platelet and plasma systems 
such redesign may be costly  time consuming and require further regulatory review 
fenwal is not obligated to provide support for development and testing of improvements or changes we may make to the intercept blood system 
we may be unable to identify  select  and qualify such manufacturers or those third parties able to provide support for development and testing activities on a timely basis or enter into contracts with them on reasonable terms  if at all 
raw material and component suppliers may not meet quality specifications we have set  which would cause a disruption in supply and may lead to lost sales and irreparable damage to our customer relationships 
in  non conformities in certain components caused delays in manufacturing of intercept kits 
should similar or other non conformities occur in the future  we may be unable to manufacture products to meet customer demands 
moreover  the inclusion of components manufactured by new suppliers could require us to seek new or updated approvals from regulatory authorities  which could result in delays in product delivery 
we may not receive any such required regulatory approvals 
in the event of a failure by fenwal or other manufacturers to perform their obligations to supply components of the intercept blood system to us  damages recoverable by us may be insufficient to compensate us for the full loss of business opportunity 
many of our supply agreements contain limitations on incidental and consequential damages that we may recover 
a supplier s potential liability in the event of non performance may not be sufficient to compel the supplier to continue to act in conformity with our agreements 

table of contents our product supply chain requires us to purchase certain components in minimum quantities and may result in a production cycle of more than one year 
significant disruptions to any of the steps in our supply chain process may result in longer productions cycles which could lead to inefficient use of cash 
we are in the early stages of commercializing the intercept blood system 
as such  we have limited experience overseeing the manufacture of intercept illuminators and disposable kits and may encounter unforeseen manufacturing difficulties which  at a minimum  may lead to higher than anticipated costs  scrap rates or delays in manufacturing products 
in addition  we may not receive timely or accurate demand information from distributors or may not accurately forecast demand ourselves for the intercept blood system 
as a result  we may carry excess work in process or finished goods inventory  which would consume capital resources and may become obsolete  or our inventory may be inadequate to meet customer demand 
we have entered into certain public tenders  some which call for us to maintain certain minimum levels of inventory 
if our suppliers fail to produce components or our finished products satisfactorily  timely  at acceptable costs  and in sufficient quantities  we may incur delays  shortfalls and additional expenses  or non compliance with certain public tenders which may in turn result in permanent harm to our customer relations or loss of customers 
our platelet and plasma system disposables have received regulatory approval for two year shelf lives 
we and our distributors may be unable to ship product to customers prior to the expiration of product shelf life  which would require that we destroy or consume the outdated inventory in product demonstration activities 
product expiration may in turn lead to elevated product demonstration costs or reduced gross margins 
the platelet system is not compatible with some commercial platelet collection methods 
the equipment and materials used to collect platelets vary by manufacturer and by geographic region 
platelets may be collected from a single donor by apheresis using an automated collection machine 
apheresis devices currently used in the united states and european markets differ  among other characteristics  in their ability to collect platelets in reduced volumes of plasma 
platelet concentrates may also be prepared from whole blood by pooling together platelets from multiple donors 
there are two commonly used methods for preparing whole blood platelets the buffy coat method  which is used extensively in europe  and the pooled random donor method  which is used in the united states 
our system for platelets is designed to work with platelets collected and stored in storage solutions  called intersol and ssp  and for platelets suspended in plasma 
in order to address the entire market in the united states and japan  we would need to develop and test additional configurations of the platelet system 
we estimate that the majority of platelets used in the united states are collected by apheresis  though a significant minority is prepared from pooled random donor platelets derived from whole blood collections 
in order to gain regulatory approvals for a pathogen inactivation system compatible with random donor platelets  we will need to perform additional product development and testing  including additional clinical trials 
similarly  to achieve market acceptance in certain geographies  we may be required to design  develop and test new product configurations for the platelet and plasma systems 
these development activities would increase our costs significantly  and may not be successful 
other manufacturers supplying blood component collection platforms to the market may resist our efforts to make the intercept blood system compatible with their platforms and may have competing pathogen inactivation technologies 
attaining compatibility with collection platforms manufactured by others may require adaptations to either the intercept blood system or to the collection platforms  which may be difficult to engineer  expensive to implement and test  require additional clinical trials  cause delays in regulatory approval and or be commercially unattractive to pursue 
these development activities will increase our costs significantly  and may not be successful 
market acceptance of the intercept blood system may be delayed until the system receives regulatory approval for use on such other equipment  if required 

table of contents we have used prototype components in our preclinical studies and clinical trials of the intercept red blood cell system and have not completed the components commercial design 
we will be required to identify and enter into agreements with third parties to manufacture the red blood cell system 
our red blood cell system that was used in our preclinical studies and phase i red blood cell trial was a prototype of the system to be used in the final products 
as a result  we plan to perform additional preclinical and clinical studies using the commercial versions of the systems to demonstrate the acceptability of the commercial configuration and the equivalence of the prototypes and the commercial products  which may increase our expenses and delay the commercialization of our products 
we may determine that the red blood cell system may not be commercially feasible from potential customers perspectives 
if we fail to develop commercial versions of the intercept red blood cell system on schedule  our potential revenue would be delayed or diminished and our potential competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do 
in addition  the design and engineering effort required to complete the final commercial product will likely be substantial and time consuming 
as with any complex development effort  we expect to encounter design  engineering and manufacturing issues 
such issues have previously arisen  sometimes unexpectedly  and solutions to these issues have not always been readily forthcoming 
additional unforeseen design  engineering and manufacturing issues may arise in the future  which could increase the development cost and delay commercialization of our products 
we will need to identify and contract with manufacturers who can develop processes to manufacture components and the compounds used in the red blood cell system 
for commercial manufacturing  we will need to demonstrate to regulatory authorities that the commercial scale manufacturing processes comply with government regulations and that the compounds are equivalent to originally licensed compounds 
it may be difficult to economically manufacture the red blood cell system on a commercial scale 
if our competitors develop superior products to ours or market their products more effectively than we market our products  our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated 
we expect our products to encounter significant competition 
the intercept blood system products compete with other approaches to blood safety currently in use  and may compete with future products that may be developed by others 
our success will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to customer and prospective customer needs and medical and technological changes brought about by the development and introduction of new products 
competitors products or technologies may make our products obsolete or non competitive before we are able to generate any significant revenue 
in addition  competitors or potential competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have 
they may also have greater experience in preclinical testing  human clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures 
if competitors products experience significant problems  customers and potential customers may question the safety and efficacy of all pathogen inactivation technologies  including the intercept blood system 
such questions and concerns may impair our ability to market and sell the intercept blood system 
several companies have  or are developing  technologies that are  or in the future may be  the basis for products that will directly compete with or reduce the market for our pathogen inactivation systems 
a number of companies are specifically focusing on alternative strategies for pathogen inactivation in platelets and plasma 
these alternative strategies may be more effective in inactivating certain types of pathogens from blood products  including non lipid enveloped pathogens  such as hepatitis a virus  which our products have not demonstrated an ability to inactivate  or human parvovirus b  for which our products have not demonstrated a high level of inactivation 
while our products can effectively inactivate a broad spectrum of pathogens in blood components  including more robust inactivation of many pathogens than has been shown by other companies  market acceptance of our products may be reduced if customers determine that competitor s products inactivate a broader range of pathogens that are of particular interest to the transfusion medicine community 
in addition  customers and prospective customers may believe that our competitor s products are safer or more cost effective than intercept blood system products 
in europe  several companies  including grifols sa  octapharma 
table of contents ag and macopharma international  are developing or selling commercial pathogen inactivation systems or services to treat fresh frozen plasma 
caridianbct becoming terumobct has developed a pathogen inactivation system for blood products and has been issued ce marks for a pathogen reduction system for both platelets and plasma 
we understand that caridianbct is also developing a pathogen inactivation system for whole blood 
caridianbct s product candidate  if successful  may offer competitive advantages over our intercept blood system 
caridianbct was recently acquired by terumo corporation  a large japanese based  multinational corporation with more mature products and relationships than we have 
our ability to commercialize our products in certain markets  particularly japan  may be negatively affected by terumo s resources and their pre existing relationships with regulators and customers 
other companies developing competing products may also offer and sell other blood banking products and services 
as a result  competitors may have pre existing long term relationships with customers and may be able to offer synergies for both pathogen inactivation and non pathogen inactivation products that we are unable to offer 
new methods of testing whole blood for specific pathogens have been approved by the fda and in europe  as have tests for bacteria in platelets 
other companies are marketing rapid  point of care bacterial tests  and developing synthetic blood product substitutes and products to stimulate the growth of platelets 
development and commercialization of any of these or other related technologies could limit the potential market for our products 
we may be liable and we may need to withdraw our products from the market if our products harm people 
we may be liable if an accident occurs in our controlled use of hazardous materials 
our insurance coverage may be inadequate to offset losses we may incur 
we are exposed to potential liability risks inherent in the testing and marketing of medical devices and pharmaceutical products 
we may be liable if any of our products cause injury  illness or death 
although we will have completed rigorous preclinical and clinical safety testing prior to marketing our products  there may be harmful effects caused by our products that we are unable to identify in preclinical or clinical testing 
in particular  unforeseen  rare reactions or adverse side effects related to long term use of our products may not be observed until the products are in widespread commercial use 
because of the limited duration and number of patients receiving blood components treated with the intercept blood system products in clinical trials  it is possible that harmful effects of our products not observed in clinical and preclinical testing could be discovered after a marketing approval has been received 
for example  in cases where we have obtained regulatory approval for our products  we have demonstrated pathogen inactivation to specified levels based on well established tests 
however  there is no way to determine  after treatment by our products  whether our products have completely inactivated all of the pathogens that may be present in blood components 
there is also no way to determine whether any residual amount of a pathogen remains in the blood component treated by our products  and there is no way to exclude that such residual amount would be enough to cause disease in the transfused patient 
for ethical reasons  we cannot conduct human testing to determine whether an individual who receives a transfusion of a blood component containing a pathogen that was inactivated using the intercept blood system might show positive results if tested for an antibody against that pathogen 
while we believe  based on the clinical experience of our scientists  that the level of inactivated pathogens would likely be too small to induce a detectable antibody response in diagnostic tests  we cannot exclude that a transfused patient might show positive results if tested for an antibody against that pathogen 
we could be subject to a claim from a patient that tests positive  even though that patient did not contract a disease 
later discovery of problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in additional restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
we are subject to risks and costs of product recall  which include not only potential out of pocket costs  but also potential interruption to our supply chain 
in such an event  our customer relations would be harmed and we would incur unforeseen losses 
we maintain product liability insurance  but do not know whether the insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products 

table of contents our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including certain hazardous chemicals  radioactive materials and infectious pathogens  such as hiv and hepatitis viruses 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials are adequate and comply with regulatory requirements  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury 
if an accident occurs  we could be held liable for any damages that result 
if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our future operations or if we are unable to generate positive cash flows from our operations  we will need to curtail planned development or sales and commercialization activities 
our near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the intercept blood system  costs associated with pursuing regulatory approval in geographies where we do not currently sell our platelet and plasma systems  costs associated with planning and conducting studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system  timing and magnitude of payments under grants from the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property 
our long term capital requirements will also be dependent on competitive developments  clinical development and regulatory factors 
until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations  meeting our long term capital requirements is in large part subject to access to public and private equity and debt capital markets  as well as to additional collaborative arrangements with partners or government grants  augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
we believe that cash received from product sales and government grants  our available cash balances  and access to debt will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
we have borrowed and in the future may borrow capital from institutional and commercial banking sources 
potential borrowings may include restrictive covenants  including covenants that restrict the operation of our business  liens on assets  high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to product revenues  our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
as a result of economic conditions and general global economic uncertainty and other factors  we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will be able to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms 
if we are unable to raise additional capital due to disruptions to the global credit and financial markets and general economic uncertainty or other factors  we may need to curtail planned development or commercialization activities 
in addition  we will need to obtain additional funds to complete development activities for the red blood cell system necessary for regulatory approval in europe  and we do not plan on conducting any additional clinical trials of the platelet or the plasma systems in the united states unless and until we can obtain sufficient additional funding 
historically  we have received significant awards in funding under cooperative agreements with the dod for the intercept blood system 
access to federal grants and cooperative agreements is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal government  including the united states congress 
the general economic environment  coupled with tight federal budgets  has led to a general decline in the amount available for government funding 
there is no assurance that we will be awarded future federal grants and cooperative agreements for the intercept blood system 

table of contents we have only a limited operating history  and we expect to continue to generate losses 
we may never achieve a profitable level of operations 
our development and selling  general  and administrative expenses have resulted in substantial losses each year since our inception with the exception of the year ended december  the platelet and plasma systems are not yet approved in the united states or in many other countries around the world 
the red blood cell system is in clinical development and may never emerge from the clinical development stage as a marketed product 
we may be required to reduce the sales price for our products in order to make our products economically attractive to our customers and to governmental and private payors  which may reduce or altogether eliminate our gross profit on sales 
at our present sales levels of the platelet and plasma systems  our costs to manufacture  distribute  market  sell  support and administer the systems are in excess of revenue 
contribution from product sales is unlikely to exceed the costs we incur in research  development  and commercialization of the intercept blood system for near term 
we expect our losses to continue at least until the intercept blood system achieves more significant market acceptance 
to the extent that we reach agreement on a clinical pathway with the fda for any or all of our products and if we choose to pursue such opportunities  we would expect to incur substantial costs which could extend the period during which we expect to operate at a loss 
we have issued debt containing certain covenants that we may be unable to comply with 
our operations may not provide sufficient cash to meet the repayment obligations of the note 
in september  we entered into a loan and security agreement  or credit agreement  for million  of which we immediately borrowed million and subsequently drew an additional million from the revolving line of credit under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement is secured by all our current and future assets  except for intellectual property and of our investment in our subsidiary  cerus europe bv the credit agreement requires that we comply with certain customary and routine covenants  including the requirement to maintain a minimum cash balance of million and achieve minimum revenue levels  which are measured monthly based on a six month trailing basis and must be at least of the pre established future projected revenues for the trailing six month period 
if we are unable to increase our revenues to comply with the covenants in the credit agreement  the lender may call the note which would require us to repay the principal of the note sooner than we have anticipated 
in the event that the note was called due to non compliance with the covenants  we may be unable to pay back the principal  which would allow the lender to liquidate collateralized assets 
this in turn  would harm our business 
in addition  our operations may not reach the levels needed to meet the scheduled repayment obligations of the note 
if we are unable to meet the scheduled repayment obligations of the note using our available cash  we may be forced to liquidate other assets  refinance the notes or issue equity securities to raise the necessary cash to meet our obligations 
there is no assurance that we would be able to sufficiently or timely liquidate assets to meet the note s repayment obligations or that we would be able to refinance the notes or issue equity  in which case our business would be significantly harmed and may force us into bankruptcy 
virtually all of our research and development activities and the significant majority of our general and administrative activities are performed in or managed from a single site that may be subject to lengthy business interruption in the event of a severe earthquake 
we also may suffer loss of computerized information and may be unable to make timely filings with regulatory agencies in the event of catastrophic failure of our data storage and backup systems 
virtually all of our research and development activities and the significant majority of our general and administrative activities are performed in or managed from our facilities in concord  california  which are within an active earthquake fault zone 
should a severe earthquake occur  we might be unable to occupy our facilities or conduct research and development and general and administrative activities in support of our business and products until such time as our facilities could be repaired and made operational 
our property and casualty and business interruption insurance in general does not cover losses caused by earthquakes 
while we have taken certain measures to protect our scientific  technological and commercial assets  a lengthy or costly disruption due to an earthquake would have a material adverse effect on us 
we have also taken measures to limit damage that 
table of contents may occur from the loss of computerized data due to power outage  system or component failure  or corruption of data files 
however  we may lose critical computerized data  which may be difficult or impossible to recreate  which may harm our business 
we may be unable to make timely filings with regulatory agencies in the event of catastrophic failure of our data storage and backup systems  which may subject us to fines or adverse consequences  up to and including loss of our abilities to conduct business 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or operate our business without infringing intellectual property rights of others 
our commercial success will depend  in part  on obtaining and maintaining patent protection on our products and successfully defending our products against third party challenges 
our technology will be protected from unauthorized use only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or effectively maintained as trade secrets 
as a result  our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we cannot be certain that our patents or patents that we license from others will be enforceable and afford protection against competitors 
our patents or patent applications  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technologies 
others may independently develop technologies similar to ours or independently duplicate our technologies 
for example  a united states patent issued to a third party covers methods to remove psoralen compounds from blood products 
we have reviewed the patent and believe there exists substantial questions concerning its validity 
we cannot be certain  however  that a court would hold the patent to be invalid or not infringed by our platelet or plasma systems  if and when those products are sold in the united states 
as a result  in order to commercialize our platelet or plasma systems in the united states  we may be required to obtain a license from the owner of the patent  which we may not be able to do at a reasonable cost or at all 
our patents expire at various dates between and recent patent applications will  if granted  result in patents with later expiration dates 
in addition  we have a license from fenwal to united states and foreign patents relating to the intercept blood system  which expire at various dates from to due to the extensive time required for development  testing and regulatory review of our potential products  our patents may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization 
this would reduce or eliminate any advantage of the patents 
we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
we may need to license the right to use third party patents and intellectual property to continue development and commercialization of our products 
we may not be able to acquire such required licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain such licenses  we may need to design around other parties patents  or we may not be able to proceed with the development  manufacture or sale of our products 
our patents do not cover all of the countries in which we are selling  and planning to sell  our products 
we will not be able to prevent potential competitors from using our technology in countries where we do not have patent coverage 
we may face litigation to defend against claims of infringement  assert claims of infringement  enforce our patents  protect our trade secrets or know how or determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights 
patent litigation is costly 
in addition  we may require interference proceedings before the united states patent and trademark office to determine the priority of inventions relating to our patent applications 
litigation or interference proceedings could be expensive and time consuming  and we could be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights 

table of contents we may rely  in certain circumstances  on trade secrets to protect our technology 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we protect our proprietary technology and processes  in part  by confidentiality agreements with employees and contractors 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach or our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that our employees  consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others  disputes also may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions 
as our international operations grow  we may be subject to adverse fluctuations in exchange rates between the united states dollar and foreign currencies 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  among other factors differing political  economic  and regulatory climates  different tax structures  and foreign exchange volatility 
we do not currently enter into any hedging contracts to normalize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations 
as a result  our future results could be materially affected by changes in these or other factors 
product sales of our blood safety products are typically made in europe and generally are invoiced to customers in euros 
in addition  we purchase finished disposable kits for our platelet and plasma systems and incur certain operating expenses in euros and other foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility is a direct result of our product sales  cash collection and expenses to support our international operations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations are recorded as a component of interest expense and other  net on our consolidated statements of operations 
significant fluctuations in the volatility of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar may materially affect our results of operations 
currently we do not have any near term plans to enter into a formal hedging program to mitigate the effects of foreign currency volatility 
the market price of our stock may be highly volatile 
the market prices for our securities and those of other emerging medical device and biotechnology companies have been  and may continue to be  volatile 
for example  during the period from january  to december   the sale price of our common stock as quoted on the nasdaq global market fluctuated within a range from a low of to a high of 
announcements may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
such announcements may include decisions regarding reimbursement and commercial adoption by customers  national blood services or governmental bodies  biological or medical discoveries  technological innovations discovered or new commercial services offered by us or our competitors  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents and litigation matters  regulatory developments  status of development partnerships  dilution from future issuances of common stock  including common stock issued pursuant to our at the market issuance sales agreement  with mlv co 
llc  or through the exercise of warrants and vested stock options  debt financings  with terms that may not be viewed favorably by stockholders  public concern as to the safety of new technologies  general market conditions  comments made by analysts  including changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance  and quarterly fluctuations in our revenue and financial results 

table of contents we may fail to comply fully with elements of the sarbanes oxley act of our failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of this act could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accountants attesting to the effectiveness of our internal controls 
these requirements extend to the operations of our subsidiary in europe 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude in future periods that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of if we cannot favorably assess  or our independent registered public accountants are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reports may be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
provisions of our charter documents  our stockholder rights plan and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the offer may be considered beneficial by our stockholders 
provisions of the delaware general corporation law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay  deter or prevent a change in control 
the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law  unless its application has been waived  provides certain default anti takeover protections in connection with transactions between the company and an interested stockholder of the company 
generally  section prohibits stockholders who  alone or together with their affiliates and associates  own more than of the subject company from engaging in certain business combinations for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder of such subject company without approval of the board or the vote of two thirds of the shares held by the independent stockholders 
our board of directors has also adopted a stockholder rights plan  or poison pill  which would significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer 
additionally  provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could deter  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders  including without limitation  the authority of the board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  operating results for the year ended december  are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research  development  clinical testing and commercialization of the intercept blood system and  from until late  immunotherapies for cancer and infectious disease 
the intercept blood system is designed for three blood components 
the intercept blood system for platelets  or platelet system  and our intercept blood system for plasma  or plasma system  have received ce marks and are being marketed and sold in a number of countries in europe  the commonwealth of independent states  or cis  the middle east and selected countries in other regions around the world 
in addition  we are developing and plan to perform the required clinical trials for our intercept blood system for red blood cells  or red blood cell system  in europe 
subject to the availability of adequate funding from partners  government grants and or capital markets  we intend to complete development activities for the red blood cell system necessary for regulatory approval in europe and we may seek regulatory approval of our products in the united states 
our near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the intercept blood system  costs associated with pursuing regulatory approval in geographies where we do not currently sell our platelet and plasma systems  costs associated with planning and conducting studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system  timing and magnitude of payments under grants from the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property 
our long term capital requirements will also be dependent on competitive developments  clinical development and regulatory factors 
we believe that cash received from product sales and government grants  our available cash balances and access to debt will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
we may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth outside of our credit agreement with comerica bank  as described below  on terms that may include restrictive covenants  which may comprise of covenants that restrict the operation of our business  liens on assets  high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if we are unable to raise additional capital due to disruptions to the global credit and financial markets and general economic uncertainty or other factors  we may need to curtail planned development or commercialization activities 
we recognize product revenues from the sale of our platelet and plasma systems in europe  the cis  the middle east  and certain other countries around the world 
our product revenues increased by million during the year ended december  compared to the december  primarily as a result of an increase in volume sales to existing customers and sales to new customers due to increased market penetration and customer adoption of the intercept blood system in europe  the cis  and the middle east 
although our revenues have grown over time  if we are unable to gain widespread commercial adoption in markets where our blood safety products are approved for commercialization  we anticipate that we may have difficulties achieving profitability 
as such  we may never achieve a profitable level of operations in the future as we must conduct significant research  development  preclinical and clinical evaluation  commercialization and regulatory compliance activities for our product candidates  which  together with anticipated selling  general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial losses 

table of contents in addition to the product revenues from sales of our platelet and plasma systems  we recognize revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements 
historically  we have received significant awards in funding under cooperative agreements with the united states department of defense  or dod  for the intercept blood system 
any such funding is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal government  including the united states congress 
in august  we were awarded a million grant from the dod to support the development of our red blood cell system 
we recognize revenue associated with this award as qualified costs are incurred for reimbursement over the performance period of one year from the date of issuance 
the general economic environment  coupled with tight federal budgets  has led to a general decline in the amount available for government funding 
there is no assurance that we will be awarded future federal grants and cooperative agreements for the intercept blood system 
in  we spun off our immunotherapy business  and in entered into agreements to license the immunotherapy technologies to aduro biotech  or aduro 
in connection with those agreements  we received and currently hold preferred shares representing less than of aduro s capital 
pursuant to these license agreements  we will obtain a royalty fee on any future sales resulting from certain technology 
in april  aduro completed a subsequent round of financing  issuing series b preferred stock and as a result  reduced our ownership in aduro to less than 
since receiving preferred stock in aduro  we have carried our investment in aduro at zero on our consolidated balance sheet as we have no basis to believe that we will receive any economic benefit from our equity ownership in aduro as we believed that aduro s technology platforms  which were largely based on the in process development programs of anza therapeutics inc  or anza therapeutics  had a high risk of failure 
we pay royalties to fenwal inc  or fenwal  on future intercept blood system product sales under certain agreements which arose from the sale of the transfusion therapies division of baxter international inc  or baxter  in to fenwal  at rates of of net sales for our platelet system  of net sales for our plasma system  of net sales for our red blood cell system  and on net sales of illumination devices  or illuminators 
we also pay fenwal certain costs associated with the amended manufacturing and supply agreement we executed with fenwal in december for the manufacture of intercept finished disposable kits for our platelet and plasma systems through december  under the amended manufacturing and supply agreement  we pay fenwal a set price per disposable kit  which is established annually  plus a fixed surcharge per disposable kit 
in addition  volume driven manufacturing overhead will be paid or refunded if actual manufacturing volumes are higher or lower than the annually estimated production volumes 
we are also obligated to provide certain disposable kit components at no cost to fenwal under the amended manufacturing and supply agreement 
this required us to enter into manufacturing and supply arrangements with certain other manufacturers for those components  some of which contain minimum purchase commitments 
as a result  our supply chain for certain of these components  held as work in process on our consolidated balance sheets  may potentially take over one year to complete production before being utilized in finished disposable kits 
in august  we completed an acquisition of certain assets of bioone corporation  or bioone  including the commercialization rights that both baxter later fenwal and we granted to bioone for both the platelet and plasma systems 
concurrent with the acquisition  fenwal and we terminated the commercialization rights we and fenwal granted to bioone 
as a consequence of the termination  and pursuant to a pre existing agreement with fenwal  our commercialization rights to the platelet and plasma systems under our and agreements with baxter became worldwide 
as consideration for the acquired bioone assets  we relinquished all shares we held in bioone valued at approximately million and issued  shares of our common stock to bioone valued at approximately million  of which  shares were issued at the close of the acquisition on august  and the remaining  shares were issued six months from the close of the acquisition date on february  accordingly  at the acquisition date  we recorded the fair value of the assets acquired  consisting of commercialization rights in asia of million and illuminators of million  with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the asset acquired was recorded as goodwill of million 
the recognition of goodwill was attributable to the buyer specific value derived by us as a result of acquiring the commercialization rights in certain asian countries in order to complete the global commercialization rights for our platelet and plasma systems 

table of contents in june  we entered into an at the market issuance sales agreement  or sales agreement  with mlv co 
llc  or mlv  that provides for the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock over the term of the sales agreement having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through mlv as our sales agent 
during the year ended december   approximately million shares of our common stock were sold under the sales agreement for aggregate net proceeds of million 
subsequent to the year ended december  through the date of filing this annual report on form k  we sold approximately million of additional shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
in september  we entered into a loan and security agreement  or credit agreement  with comerica bank  or comerica  which provides for a growth capital loan of up to million  or growth capital loan  and a formula based revolving line of credit of up to million plus any unused amounts from the growth capital loan 
under the credit agreement  we are limited to an aggregate borrowing of up to million at any time 
we pledged all current and future assets  excluding our intellectual property and of our investment in our subsidiary  cerus europe bv  as security for borrowings under the credit agreement 
we are also required to maintain compliance with certain customary and routine financial covenants  including maintaining a minimum cash balance with comerica and achieving certain minimum revenue levels 
concurrent with the execution of the credit agreement  we borrowed million of the growth capital loan  substantially all of which was used to repay our prior debt with oxford finance corporation  or oxford  with the remainder used for general corporate purposes 
in addition  we drew million from the revolving line of credit in critical accounting policies and management estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  accrued liabilities  valuation and impairment of purchased intangibles and goodwill  valuation of warrants  non cash stock compensation assumptions  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue we recognize revenue in accordance with asc topic  revenue recognition arrangements with multiple deliverables  as applicable 
revenue is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an agreement with the funding party exists  ii services have been rendered or product has been delivered  iii pricing is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is probable 
revenue related to product sales is generally recognized when we fulfill our obligations for each element of an agreement 
for all sales of our intercept blood system products  we use a binding purchase order and signed sales contract as evidence of a written agreement 
we sell intercept blood system for platelets and plasma directly to blood banks  hospitals  universities  government agencies  as well as to distributors in certain regions 
generally  our contracts with customers do not provide for open return rights  except within a reasonable time after receipt of goods in the case of defective or non conforming product 
deliverables and the units of accounting vary according to the provisions of each purchase order or sales contract 
for revenue arrangements with multiple elements  we evaluate whether the delivered elements have stand alone value to the customer 
prior to adoption of asu no 
 consideration received was allocated to elements that were identified as discrete units of accounting based on the relative fair value method 
beginning january   consideration received is allocated to elements that are identified as discrete units of accounting based on the best estimated selling price 
we have determined that vendor specific objective evidence is not discernable due to our limited 
table of contents history of selling our products and variability in our pricing 
since our products are novel and unique and are not sold by others  third party evidence of selling price is unavailable 
freight costs charged to customers are recorded as a component of revenue under asc topic  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs and value added taxes  or vat  that we invoice to our customers and remit to governments  are recorded on a net basis  which excludes such vat from product revenue 
revenue related to the cost reimbursement provisions under development contracts is recognized as the costs on the projects are incurred 
we receive certain united states government grants and contracts that support research in defined research projects 
these grants generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs incurred as defined in the various grants 
inventory we own certain components of intercept disposable kits in the form of work in process inventory and finished goods  uva illuminators  and certain replacement parts for our illuminators 
our supply chain for certain of these components  held as work in process on our consolidated balance sheet  can potentially take over one year to complete production before being utilized in finished disposable kits 
we maintain an inventory balance based on our current sales projections  and at each reporting period  we evaluate whether our work in process inventory would be consumed for production of finished units in order to sell to existing and prospective customers within the next twelve month period 
it is not customary for our production cycle for inventory to exceed twelve months 
instead  we use our best judgment to factor in lead times for the production of our finished units to meet our current demands 
if actual results differ from those estimates  work in process inventory could potentially accumulate for periods exceeding one year 
under our manufacturing and supply agreement with fenwal  our carrying value of intercept disposable kits is dependent on an annually set price 
in addition  at the end of each year  volume driven manufacturing overhead is either paid or refunded by or to us if manufacturing volumes are higher or lower than the anticipated manufacturing volumes at the time the price is established 
as a result  manufacturing overhead can fluctuate and requires us to use judgment in accruing the manufacturing overhead 
in addition  we use judgment in determining whether the manufacturing overhead is a cost of our inventory and recoverable when product is sold 
we use significant judgment and evaluate manufacturing variances incurred during periods of abnormally low production by considering a variety of factors including the reasons for low production volumes  anticipated future production levels that correlate to and offset volumes experienced during abnormally low production cycles and contractual requirements 
we record manufacturing variances incurred during periods without production as a component of cost of product revenue on our consolidated statements of operations 
inventory is recorded at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market value 
our platelet and plasma system disposable kits generally have a two year shelf life from the date of manufacture 
illuminators and replacement parts do not have regulated expiration dates 
we use significant judgment to analyze and determine if the composition of our inventory is obsolete  slow moving  or unsalable and frequently review such determinations 
our limited history selling the intercept blood system limits the amount of historical data we have to perform this analysis 
generally  we write down specifically identified unusable  obsolete  slow moving  or known unsalable inventory that has no alternative use in the period that it is first recognized by using a number of factors including product expiration dates  open and unfulfilled orders  and sales forecasts 
any write down of our inventory to net realizable value establishes a new cost basis and will be maintained even if certain circumstances suggest that the inventory is recoverable in subsequent periods 
costs associated with the write down of inventory are recorded in cost of product revenue on our consolidated statements of operations 
accrued expenses we record accrued liabilities for expenses related to certain contract research activities and development services  including those related to clinical trials  preclinical safety studies and external laboratory studies  as well as development activities being performed by third parties 
some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
specifically  accruals for clinical trials require us to make estimates surrounding costs 
table of contents associated with patients at various stages of the clinical trial  pass through costs to clinical sites  contract research organization costs including fees  database development  and reporting costs  among others 
goodwill and intangible assets in august  we acquired certain assets from bioone 
we accounted for the acquisition as a business combination in accordance with asc topic  business combinations 
in connection with the acquisition  we used significant judgment  including  but not limited to  judgments as to cash flows  discount rates  and economic lives  in identifying the assets acquired and in determining the fair values to record the purchased assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  under asc topic  we were required to assess the fair value of the non controlling interest that we held in bioone prior to the acquisition 
we determined that a considerable amount of the purchase consideration was goodwill  which represents value unique to us as the holder of worldwide rights to the intercept blood system 
we may be unable to realize the recorded value of the acquired assets and our assumptions may prove to be incorrect  which may require us to write down or impair the value of the assets if and when facts and circumstances indicate a need to do so 
we perform an impairment test on our goodwill annually on august of each fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with the respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
we have determined that we operate in one reporting unit and estimate the fair value of our one reporting unit using the enterprise approach under which we consider our quoted market capitalization as reported on the nasdaq global market 
we consider quoted market prices that are available in active markets to be the best evidence of fair value 
we also consider other factors  which include future forecasted results  the economic environment and overall market conditions 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and  therefore  the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  which is used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
on august   we performed our annual review of goodwill as described above and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
we will perform an impairment test on our intangible assets by continually monitoring events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our intangible assets may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets  we then measure the amount of the impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
no events or changes in circumstances arose during the year ended december  which would require us to test the recoverability of our intangible assets 
warrants in august and november  we issued warrants to purchase million and million shares of common stock  respectively 
the material terms of the warrants were identical under each issuance except for the exercise price  date issued and expiration date 
we classified the warrants as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets as the warrants contain certain material terms which require us or our successor to purchase the warrants for cash in an amount equal to the value of the unexercised portion of the warrants as determined in accordance with the black scholes option pricing model in connection with certain change of control transactions 
in addition  we may also be required to pay cash to a warrant holder under certain circumstances if we are unable to timely deliver the shares acquired upon warrant exercise to such holder 
the fair value of these outstanding warrants is calculated using the binomial lattice option pricing model and is adjusted accordingly at each reporting period 
the binomial lattice option pricing model requires that we use significant assumptions and judgment to determine appropriate inputs to the model 
some of the assumptions that we rely on include the probability of a change of control occurring  the volatility of our stock over the life of the warrant and assumptions and inputs used to value the warrants under the black scholes model should a change of control occur 
gains and losses from warrant revaluation are recorded in gain from revaluation of warrant liability on the consolidated statements of operations 
upon the exercise or modification to remove the provisions which 
table of contents require the warrants to be treated as a liability  the fair value of the warrants will be reclassified from a liability to stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets and no further adjustment to the fair value would be made in subsequent periods 
stock based compensation we issue stock based awards to our employees  contractors and members of our board of directors  as strategic  long term incentives 
we also maintain an active employee stock purchase plan within the meaning of section b of the internal revenue code 
we record stock based compensation expense for employee awards in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of stock based awards 
the black scholes option pricing model requires that we use assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables to determine appropriate inputs to the model  which include the expected term of the grants  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  including forfeitures  our expected stock price volatility  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the grant date fair value of stock based awards is then recognized as stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period  and is adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
to the extent that stock options contain performance criteria for vesting  stock based compensation is recognized once the performance criteria are probable of being achieved 
we continue to apply the provisions of asc topic  equity based payment to non employees for our stock based awards issued to non employees 
under the provisions  the measurement date at which the fair value of the stock based award is measured to be the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the grantee to earn the equity instrument is reached or ii the date at which the grantee s performance is complete 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for the fair value of the vested portion of the non employee awards in our consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes since our inception  we have accumulated significant net operating losses and research and development credits that may be used in future periods to offset future taxable income 
we currently estimate that we may not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets 
in addition  we may not generate future taxable income prior to the expiration of our net operating loss carry forwards and research and development credits 
timing and significance of any estimated future taxable income is highly subjective and is beyond the control of management due to uncertainties in market conditions  economic environments in which we operate  and timing of regulatory approval of our products 
we do not recognize tax positions that do not have a greater than likelihood of being recognized upon review by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
use of a valuation allowance is not an appropriate substitute for the derecognition of a tax position 
we did not have any recorded liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits at december  or we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax expense 
to date  we have not recognized any interest and penalties in our consolidated statements of operations  nor have we accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties 
we continue to carry a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets 
although we believe it more likely than not that a taxing authority would agree with our current tax positions  there can be no assurance that the tax positions we have taken will be substantiated by a taxing authority if reviewed 
our tax years through remain subject to examination by the taxing jurisdictions 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue years ended december  change in thousands  except percentages to to product revenue government grants and cooperative agreements total revenue 
table of contents product revenue increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of an increase in sales volume of our disposable platelet and plasma system kits sold to existing customers due to increased market penetration and customer adoption of the intercept blood system in europe  the cis  and the middle east  which was partially offset by a decline in the sales volume of our illuminators 
product revenue increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which was driven by an increase in the number of disposable platelet and plasma system kits sold to customers in europe  the cis  and the middle east and to a lesser extent  an increase in sales volumes of our uva illuminators 
we anticipate product revenue for both our platelet and plasma systems will continue to increase in future periods as the intercept blood system gains market acceptance in geographies where commercialization efforts are underway 
the historical results may not be indicative of intercept blood system revenue in the future 
revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was partly attributable to higher reimbursable development efforts related to our red blood cell system during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period of in addition  in august  we were awarded a new grant by the dod totaling million 
revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements for the year ended december  increased by million compared to year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in the red blood cell system development activities reimbursed under awards with the dod 
cost of product revenue our cost of product revenue consists of the cost of the intercept blood system inventory sold  royalties payable to fenwal for product sales  provisions for obsolete  slow moving and unsaleable product  certain order fulfillment costs  and to the extent applicable  costs for idle facilities 
inventory is accounted for on a first in  first out basis 
years ended december  change in thousands  except percentages to to cost of product revenue cost of product revenue increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to a higher number of disposable kits sold and higher scrap rate for certain components manufactured during compared to cost of product revenue decreased by million to million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  despite the higher volume of products sold  the decrease in the cost of product revenue was due to lower manufacturing overhead variances capitalized as a result of increased production volumes during in addition  we had lower costs for obsolete  slow moving and scrapped inventory during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period of our realized gross margins on product sales were in the year ended december   down from in the year ended december   and up from in the year ended december  gross margins were negatively impacted compared to by non routine period costs  including higher scrap rates associated with certain components manufactured 
we have a limited history manufacturing these components and as such  have limited means to predict the frequency and magnitude of events leading to higher than expected scrap 
gross margins were positively impacted compared to due to incurring certain costs in as a result of abnormally low manufacturing volumes 

table of contents changes in our gross margins are affected by various factors  including manufacturing and supply chain costs  the mix of product sold  and the mix of customers to which product is sold 
generally  we offer our distributors tiered volume discounts of varying magnitudes  depending on their purchase commitments 
our gross margins may be impacted in the future based on all of these criteria 
we expect to maintain inventory levels that will be sufficient to meet forecasted demand for a relatively short time period and plan to manufacture at levels above those produced in manufacturing disposable kits at levels above the levels produced in should result in a continuing lower per unit cost of goods sold when the product is ultimately sold  however  actual manufacturing levels may differ from our assumptions 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for our scientific personnel  non cash stock based compensation  payments to consultants  costs to prepare and conduct preclinical and clinical trials  third party costs for development activities  certain regulatory costs  infrastructure  and laboratory chemicals and supplies 
years ended december  change in thousands  except percentages to to research and development research and development expenses increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to increased costs related to our efforts to further advance the development of our red blood cell system program 
research and development expenses decreased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to reduced research and development activities driven primarily by our march restructuring plan and the associated reduction in force 
of the total research and development expenses incurred  non cash stock based compensation represented million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate our research and development spending will continue to increase over the near term to further our red blood cell system development efforts in europe and will increase over the longer term if we are able to secure sufficient additional capital to pursue regulatory approval for our products in the united states 
due to the inherent uncertainties and risks associated with developing biomedical products  including  but not limited to  intense and changing government regulation  uncertainty of future pre clinical and clinical trial results and uncertainty associated with manufacturing  it is not possible to reasonably estimate the costs to complete these research and development projects 
we face numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the successful completion of our research and development projects  which is discussed in further detail under item a risk factors in part i of this annual report on form k 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses include salaries and related expenses for administrative personnel  non cash stock based compensation  expenses for our commercialization efforts in europe and elsewhere  expenses for accounting  tax  and internal control  legal and facility related expenses  and insurance premiums 
years ended december  change in thousands  except percentages to to selling  general and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to increased spending related to the 
table of contents expansion of our marketing efforts in europe 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to decreased personnel costs and lower marketing and public affairs costs driven primarily by our march restructuring plan and the associated reduction in force as well as our continued emphasis on controlling costs 
of the total selling  general  and administrative expenses incurred  non cash stock based compensation represented million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will be focused on tightly managing growth in our selling  general  and administrative spending over the coming year  as part of a larger effort to focus our resources and conserve cash 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets relates to a license to commercialize the intercept blood system in certain asian countries in connection with our acquisition of certain assets from bioone 
the bioone transaction was accounted for as a business combination under asc topic  business combination  which assigned a fair value of million to the intangible assets in august these intangible assets are being amortized over an estimated useful life of ten years and will be reviewed for impairment as facts and circumstances arise 
years ended december  change in thousands  except percentages to to amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   as the acquisition of purchased intangible assets related to our license to commercialize the intercept blood system in certain asian countries occurred during the second half of we expect that the amortization of our intangible assets to remain relatively consistent in future periods  unless facts and circumstances arise which may result in our intangible assets being impaired

we carried our investment in bioone at zero as we had previously fully impaired our bioone investment of million during the year ended december  since we determined that certain factors were present to support our position that our bioone investment was not recoverable 
these factors included  but were not limited to  third party investor interest and participation in recent equity offerings at current pricing  business outlook of bioone and available financial information 

table of contents during the year ended december   we also recognized a gain of million  which represented the difference between the cash received and the carrying value of our non controlling equity interest in anza therapeutics as we relinquished our shares in anza therapeutics  released any claims against them and agreed to the transfer of all of anza therapeutics intellectual property to aduro in settlement gain years ended december  change in thousands  except percentages to to settlement gain in december  we and baxter international inc  or baxter  entered into a settlement agreement regarding disputed amounts for certain transition services provided in by baxter in conjunction with the transfer of commercialization rights to us

table of contents warrant liability in august and november  we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of million and million shares of common stock  respectively  in connection with offerings of our common stock 
the fair value of these outstanding warrants  which uses the binomial lattice option pricing model  is classified as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets and is adjusted at each subsequent reporting period  until such time the instruments are exercised or otherwise modified to remove the provisions which require this treatment 
upon the exercise or modification to remove the provisions which require the warrants to be treated as a liability  the fair value of the warrants will be reclassified from liabilities to stockholders equity and no further adjustment to the fair value would be made in subsequent periods 
further changes in stock price will result in similar adjustment as needed 
gain from revaluation of warrant liability increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the change in our underlying stock price  as compared to the strike price of the warrants 
gain from revaluation of warrant liability was relatively consistent in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  foreign exchange loss foreign exchange loss improved by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which was primarily attributable to favorable foreign currency variations over that time period between the euro and us dollar  our functional currency 
foreign exchange loss declined by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which was primarily attributable to unfavorable foreign currency variations between the euro and us dollar 
interest expense interest expense increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the acceleration of the closing cost and fees associated with the repayment of our prior debt and interest incurred from borrowings on our prior credit facility  and to a lesser extent  from the financing of leasehold improvements for our headquarters 
interest expense increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to interest incurred from borrowings on our prior credit facility that was entered into in march  other income expense  net other income expense  net decreased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to income from two therapeutic tax credits received during we expect to earn interest income at market rates in proportion to the marketable securities balances we maintain 
we generally hold such investments until such time as we liquidate them to meet an operating cash need 
interest paid on our investment portfolio may decrease and the value of certain securities we hold may decline  which could negatively affect our financial condition  cash flow and reported earnings 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years  our sources of capital have primarily consisted of public offerings and private placements of equity securities  debt instruments  united states government grants and cooperative agreements  and contribution from product sales  net of expenses and interest income 

table of contents at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
our cash equivalents and short term investments primarily consist of marketable debt securities  which primarily include money market instruments and  to a lesser extent  united states government agency securities  and are classified as available for sale 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities  primarily related to accounts receivable due to the timing of cash collections from our customers 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to higher revenues  improved gross margins and lower operating expenses  offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities  notably increases in accounts receivable balances and lower accrued expenses 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended december  was million compared to million net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  the increase in investing activities was primarily due to purchasing less furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   in which we incurred costs related to the consolidation and improvement of our facilities 
this change was offset by a decrease in our investment activities during the year ended december  as the proceeds received from the maturities of our existing investments are generally reinvested in money market funds with original maturities of less than days 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was million compared to million of net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended december  the decrease in investing activities was primarily due to fewer maturities of short term investments and higher purchases of furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during  we relocated our headquarters and capitalized leasehold improvements associated with the leasehold build out 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities were during the year ended december  was million compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to lower cash proceeds received from common stock offerings and the repayment of our prior debt associated with a growth capital facility agreement with oxford  which was issued in march our common stock offerings during the year ended december  related to sales of our common stock pursuant to the sales agreement in which we sold approximately million shares of our common stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  of which million was received in the first quarter of the repayment of our prior debt was a result of using substantially all of the proceeds we received from the credit agreement in september in addition  we received million during the year ended december   as we drew down on our revolving line of credit 
cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to higher cash proceeds received from common stock offerings and proceeds from the issuance of debt during the year ended december  
table of contents working capital working capital decreased to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to lower balances in cash and investments  which were used for our operations  net increases in the combined total for our accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances as a result of the timing of payments to our vendors  and increases in the current portion of our debt  as we entered into a new credit facility 
this was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable due to timing of cash collections from our customers  increases in inventory levels in order to be able to fulfill anticipated future customer demand for our products coupled with the management of our supply chain and decreases in our warrant liability 
working capital increased to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to higher cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and accounts receivable 
this was partially offset by decreases in inventory and increases in warrant liabilities and the current portion of debt 
capital requirements our near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the intercept blood system  costs associated with pursuing regulatory approval in geographies where we do not currently sell our platelet and plasma systems  costs associated with planning and conducting studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system  timing and magnitude of payments under grants from the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property 
our long term capital requirements will also be dependent on competitive developments  clinical developments and regulatory factors 
until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations  meeting our long term capital requirements is in large part subject to access to public and private equity and debt capital markets  as well as to additional collaborative arrangements with partners or government grants  augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
we believe that cash received from product sales and government grants  our available cash balances and access to debt will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
we may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth outside of our credit agreement with comerica bank  as described below  on terms that may include restrictive covenants  which may comprise of covenants that restrict the operation of our business  liens on assets  high effective interest rates and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
the disruptions to the global credit and financial markets and general economic uncertainty has generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain and the terms less favorable to the companies seeking to raise financing 
as a result of these and other factors  we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will be able to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms 
if we are unable to raise additional capital due to disruptions to the global credit and financial markets and general economic uncertainty or other factors  we may need to curtail planned development or commercialization activities 
other information historically  we have received significant awards in funding under cooperative agreements with the dod for the intercept blood system 
any such funding is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal government  including the united states congress 
the 
table of contents general economic environment  coupled with tight federal budgets  has led to a general decline in the amount available for government funding 
we are unsure whether government funding will be available to us in the future  or if available  at what levels

table of contents operating leases we generally lease our office facilities and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases with initial terms in excess of one year that require us to pay operating costs  property taxes  insurance and maintenance 
these facility leases generally contain renewal options and provisions adjusting the lease payments if those renewal options are exercised 
our lease payments have increased as we exercised a ten year extension option on december  to extend the term of our concord california lease 
however  we have the right to early terminate the concord california lease  which may occur as early as january our facility leases qualify as operating leases under asc topic  leases and as such  are not included on our consolidated balance sheets 
other commitments our other commitments primarily consist of obligations for landlord financed leasehold improvements  which are in addition to the operating leases we have for office and laboratory space 
we pay for the financed leasehold improvements as a component of rent and are required to reimburse our landlords over the remaining life of the respective leases 
if we exercise our right to early terminate the concord california lease  which may occur as early as january  we would be required to pay for any remaining portion of the landlord financed leasehold improvements at such time 
at december   we had an outstanding liability of million related to these leasehold improvements 
debt in september  we entered into a credit agreement with comerica 
the credit agreement provides for a growth capital loan of up to million  or growth capital loan  and a formula based revolving line of credit  or rloc  of up to million plus any unused amounts from the growth capital loan 
under the credit agreement  we are limited to an aggregate borrowing of up to million at any time 
we pledged all current and future assets  excluding our intellectual property and of our investment in our subsidiary  cerus europe bv  as security for borrowings under the credit agreement 
concurrent with the execution of the credit agreement  in september  we borrowed and issued million of the growth capital loan  or growth capital loan a  substantially all of which was used to repay our prior debt with oxford  with the remainder used for general corporate purposes 
growth capital loan a  which matures in months  bears a fixed interest rate of  with interest only payments due for the first twelve months  followed by equal principal and interest payments for the remaining months

throughout the term of the credit agreement  we are also obligated to meet certain conditions which include maintaining a minimum cash balance of million at comerica and achieving minimum revenue levels  which are measured monthly based on a six month trailing basis and must be at least of the pre established future projected revenues for the trailing six month period 
non compliance with the covenants could result in the principal of the note becoming due and payable 
as of december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants as set forth in the credit agreement 
financial instruments we maintain an investment portfolio of various securities  which are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio to assist us in funding our operations 
we did not have any unrealized gains at december  unrealized gains totaled million at december  we invest our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of financial instruments  consisting primarily of high credit  high liquidity united states government agency securities  money market funds and interest bearing accounts with financial institutions 
our money market funds are classified as level in the fair value hierarchy  in which quoted prices are available in active markets  as the maturity of money market funds are relatively short and the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value 
our available for sale securities related to united states government agencies and corporate debt securities are classified as level in the fair value hierarchy  which uses observable inputs to quoted market prices  benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
we maintain portfolio liquidity by ensuring that the securities have active secondary or resale markets 
certain of the investments in our portfolio are subject to general market risk and more specifically  the united states mortgage industry and financial institutions 
we did not record any other than temporary impairment losses during the years ended december   and the current global economic crisis has had  and may continue to have  a negative impact on the market values of the investments in our investment portfolio 
there can be no assurance that the markets for these securities will not deteriorate further or that the institutions that these investments are with will be able to meet their debt obligations at the time we may need to liquidate such investments or until such time as the investments mature 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk of our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments balance of million at december   approximately had original maturity dates of less than days  and the remaining had original maturities more than one year 
we do not believe our exposure to interest rate risk to be material given the short term nature of our investment portfolio and the relatively flat yields in high credit  fixed income investments and the consistent yields we have experienced and anticipate experiencing across our portfolio 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
by policy  we place our investments 
table of contents with high quality debt security issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and limit duration by restricting the term for single securities and for the portfolio as a whole 
our investments are held and managed by a third party capital management adviser that in turn  utilizes a combination of active market quotes and where necessary  proprietary pricing models as well as a subscribed pricing service  in order to estimate fair value 
we invest our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of financial instruments  consisting primarily of high credit  high liquidity money market instruments  united states government agency securities  and interest bearing accounts with financial institutions 
we maintain portfolio liquidity by ensuring that the securities have active secondary or resale markets 
certain of the investments in our portfolio are subject to general market risk and  to a lesser extent  the united states mortgage industry 
while we believe that we will be able to recognize the fair value of these instruments when they mature or we sell them  there can be no assurance that the markets for these securities will not deteriorate further or that the institutions that these investments are with will be able to meet their debt obligations 
we account for our short term investments in accordance with asc topic  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
all our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are recorded as current assets on our consolidated balance sheets as they are classified as available for sale

we do not currently enter into any hedging contracts to normalize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations 
as a result  our future results could be materially impacted by changes in these or other factors 
product sales for our blood safety products are predominantly made in europe and generally are invoiced to customers in euros 
in addition  we incur operating expenses  including payment for finished goods inventory of disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems 
these inventory purchases and operating expenses are generally paid in euros and  to a much lesser degree  other foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility is a direct result of our product sales  cash collection and expenses to support our international operations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations are recorded as a component of non operating expense  net on our consolidated statements of operations 
significant fluctuations in the volatility of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar may materially impact our results of operations 
a change in foreign currency exchange rates for our accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies at december  would have negatively impacted our annual financial results by million 
currently we do not have any near term plans to enter into a formal hedging program to mitigate the effects of foreign currency volatility
