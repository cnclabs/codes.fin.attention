financial information about geographic areas during the years ended december  and  we operated primarily in the united states and had no material foreign operations 
employees as of february   we had employees  including hourly rate employees 
the number of hourly rate employees fluctuates depending upon the number and size of projects under construction at any particular time 
we have no unionized employees and believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
electrical construction through our subsidiary  southeast power corporation southeast power  we are engaged in the construction and maintenance of electric utility facilities for electric utilities and industrial customers  and the installation of fiber optic cable for fiber optic cable manufacturers  telecommunication companies and electric utilities 
southeast power  headquartered in titusville  florida  performs electrical contracting services primarily in the southeastern  mid atlantic and western regions of the united states 
southeast power has recently opened a new facility in bastrop  texas  in addition to its facilities in titusville  florida  and spartanburg  south carolina 
our electrical construction business includes the construction of transmission lines  concrete foundations  distribution systems and substations  and other electrical installation services for utility systems and industrial and specialty projects 
we also perform fiber optic cable installation which is primarily overhead optical ground wire and all dielectric self supporting cable 
our customers include many of the leading companies in the industries we serve 
representative customers include florida power light company duke energy corporation cps energy orlando utilities commission santee cooper south carolina public service authority dominion resources  inc historically  a significant portion of our revenue has come from several different customers each year 
our largest customers may change from year to year 
in the year ended december   our top three customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
since the contribution of a customer may vary from year to year  we cannot predict the future effect of the loss of any given customer 

table of contents it is our policy to commit ourselves only to the amount of work we believe we can properly supervise  equip and complete to the customer s satisfaction and timetable 
as a result of this policy and the magnitude of some of the construction projects undertaken by us  a substantial portion of our annual revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers  the specific identity of which vary from year to year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for detail on sales to major customers which exceed of total sales 
construction is customarily performed pursuant to the plans and specifications of customers 
we generally supply the management  labor  equipment and tools  while customers generally supply most of the required materials 
most projects have a duration of six months or less  although some contracts may extend beyond one year 
revenue and results of operations in our electrical construction business can be subject to seasonal variations 
these variations are influenced by weather  customer spending patterns and system loads 
the company performs electrical construction services throughout most of the united states  but historically  these services have been performed primarily in the southeast region of the united states 
electric utility customers normally perform their system upgrades and maintenance work during off peak seasons when the demand for electrical power is reduced  which is in the first two quarters of the year in the southeast region 
this pattern is typically reflected by a reduction in the number of our active projects in the third quarter 
however  since hurricane season normally peaks during the third quarter  this reduction can be offset with storm restoration work resulting from hurricane damage 
the electrical construction business is highly competitive 
we compete with other independent contractors  including larger regional and national firms that may have financial  operational  technical and marketing resources that exceed our own 
competitive factors include level of technical expertise and experience  industry reputation  quality of work  price  geographic presence  dependability  availability of skilled personnel  worker safety and financial stability 
our management believes that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors 
there can be no assurance  however  that our competitors will not develop the expertise  experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services  or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position 
we enter into contracts on the basis of either competitive bidding or direct negotiations with our customers 
competitively bid contracts account for a majority of our electrical construction revenue 
although there is considerable variation in the terms of the contracts undertaken  such contracts are typically lump sum fixed price  or unit price time and material contracts 
many of our contracts do not require our clients to purchase a minimum amount of services  and many of our contracts are cancelable on short notice 
the magnitude and duration of projects undertaken by us vary  which may result in substantial fluctuations in our backlog from time to time 
backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize from work to be performed on uncompleted contracts  including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun 
our backlog also includes certain service agreements that contain multiple year terms which fall into the category of unit price contracts 
the projected backlog amounts for these service agreement contracts are based on our historical work from these customers 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the customer s requirements during a particular period or that such estimates at any point in time are accurate 
our backlog at december   was million  of which million is believed to be firm due to the nature of our fixed priced contracts and  of which is attributable to service agreements 
of our total backlog  is reasonably expected to be completed by december  this compares to a backlog of million as of december   of which million was believed to be firm from fixed priced contracts and million of which was attributable to service agreements 
since december   our electrical construction backlog has increased significantly 
we estimate the backlog at february   to be approximately million  with million expected to be completed during for more information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in certain circumstances  we are required to provide performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety to secure our contractual commitments 
these bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors 
if we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
management is not aware of any performance bonds issued for us that have ever been called by a customer 
we currently believe that we will not have to fund any claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future 
we believe that we have adequate bonding availability for our operations as presently conducted 
as of december   outstanding performance bonds issued on behalf of our electrical construction subsidiary amounted to million 
at march   such bonds totaled million 

table of contents generally  our customers supply most or all of the materials required for a particular contract  except for the construction of concrete foundations  and we provide the personnel  tools and equipment to perform the installation services 
however  with respect to a portion of our contracts  we may supply part or all of the materials required 
in these instances  we are not dependent upon any one source for the materials that we customarily utilize to complete the job 
we are not presently experiencing  nor do we anticipate experiencing  any difficulties in procuring an adequate supply of materials 
we are subject to various federal  state and local statutes and rules regarding  among other things  contractor licensing  electrical codes  worker safety and environmental protection 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements 
the main administrative and maintenance facilities of southeast power are located on a acre tract of land near titusville  florida  which we own 
the office building is approximately  square feet 
the shop and maintenance facilities are approximately  square feet 
the administrative and maintenance offices of our south carolina facilities are located on a acre tract of land in spartanburg  south carolina  and also owned by the company 
the office building is approximately  square feet and the maintenance facilities are approximately  square feet 
the company also owns and operates administrative and warehouse facilities located on acres of land in bastrop county  texas 
the administrative building is approximately  square feet  and the warehouse facilities are approximately  square feet 
this property also includes a portable facility for security personnel 
we believe that the aforementioned properties are currently in good condition and properly maintained 
real estate through our subsidiary bayswater development corporation and its various subsidiaries bayswater  we are engaged in the acquisition  development  management and disposition of land and improved properties 
the primary focus of our real estate operations has been the development of residential condominium projects along the east coast of central florida 
in addition  on an opportunistic basis  we also engage in single family homebuilding 
we intend to continue to use our knowledge of the local real estate market obtained through our condominium development operations to selectively pursue opportunities as they arise 
during  our recent homebuilding operation consisted of two residential lots  on which two single family homebuilding projects construction has commenced 
over the past several years we have developed five condominium projects 
our most recently completed condominium project  pineapple house  is an eight story building containing thirty three luxury river view condominium units located in melbourne  florida  of which only two units remained unsold as of december  this is the first phase of a planned multi phase development 
this first phase was completed on budget and in a timely manner  and we believe the project is attractive and of high quality 
our customers generally are pre retirement  retirement or second homebuyers seeking higher quality  maintenance free residences with generous amenities 
we generally purchase land and pay for architectural  engineering and various other costs with cash reserves 
construction costs are generally funded by bank financing  none of which was outstanding as of december  as of both december  and  we had no condominium properties under construction and no backlog outstanding real estate contracts for sale excluding partial revenue already recognized on said contracts under the percentage of completion method in the real estate segment 
however  we own vacant property on which we plan to build two condominium buildings  which will comprise phase ii and phase iii of the pineapple house project 
although we have delayed the sales and construction of new condominium projects  we believe the real estate market in our area will ultimately improve and we will resume our plans for this vacant property 
however  we can provide no assurance about the real estate market or our future plans 

table of contents our historical financial performance in real estate construction is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results and  in particular  we expect financial results to vary from project to project and from quarter to quarter 
our revenue may therefore fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis  and we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the housing market has experienced the most significant downturn in recent history 
the credit markets and mortgage industry have experienced a period of unparalleled instability  and this disruption has affected buyers ability to secure financing for home purchases 
foreclosures and distress sales continue to adversely affect market conditions 
depressed local unemployment levels also affect the real estate market 
as a result of these and other factors  we continue to postpone commencement of the next phase of the pineapple house project until market conditions improve 
we are unable to predict when market conditions will improve 
market conditions may continue to have an adverse impact on the sales and pricing of our real estate properties  the commencement and development of new projects  and on the results of our real estate development operations 
the real estate industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with numerous national and local real estate developers on the basis of a number of interrelated factors  including quality  location  design  perceived value  price and reputation in the marketplace 
we believe that we have certain competitive advantages including desirable locations  attractive designs and higher quality features not generally offered by other developers in the market in which we compete 
we are subject to federal  state and local statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations regarding  among other things  zoning  building permits  environmental standards  building moratoriums and building codes 
permits and approvals mandated by regulation for development of any magnitude are often numerous  significantly time consuming and onerous to obtain  and not guaranteed 
we believe that our real estate operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations 
the real estate division administrative offices are located within the company s corporate offices located in melbourne  florida 
item a 
risk factors 
our business involves various risks associated with the operations of our company 
to provide a framework to understand our operating environment  we are providing a brief explanation of the significant risks associated with our business 
although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors  others could emerge in the future 
each of the following risks could affect our performance 
risks related to our electrical construction operations we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small group of customers 
the loss of one or more of these customers could negatively impact our revenue and results of operations 
our electrical construction customer base is highly concentrated 
for example  in the year ended december   our top three customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements herein 
our revenue could materially decline if we lose one or more of our significant customers 
in addition  revenue under our contracts with significant customers may vary from period to period  depending on the timing and volume of work which such customers order in a given period  and a result of competition from the in house service organizations of our customers 
reduced demand for our services or the loss of one or more of these customers would  if not replaced by other business  result in a decrease in revenue  margins  profits and cash receipts  which could be material 
the electrical construction industry is highly competitive 
the electrical construction business is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with other independent contractors  including larger regional and national firms that may have financial  operational  technical and marketing resources that exceed our own 
we also face competition from existing and prospective customers establishing or augmenting in house service organizations that employ personnel who perform some of the same types of service as those provided by us 
some of our competitors may have lower cost structures and may  therefore  be able to provide their services at lower rates than we can provide 
many of our current and potential 
table of contents competitors  especially our competitors with national scope  also may have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
if we fail to compete favorably with new or existing competitors  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our business is affected by the spending patterns of our customers and adverse weather conditions  exposing us to variable quarterly results 
our revenues are primarily driven by the spending patterns of our customers  which can vary significantly from period to period  as well as seasonal variations 
these variations are influenced by weather  hours of daylight  available system outages from utilities  bidding seasons and holidays and can have a significant impact on our gross margins 
most of our work is performed outdoors and as a result  our results of operations can be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
any weather related delays in the completion of  or which increase the cost of  our projects could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations in any one or more of our reporting periods 
an adverse change in economic conditions in the electric utility industry could reduce the demand for our services 
because a substantial portion of our electrical construction work is performed for customers in the electric utility industry  an adverse change in economic conditions in the electric utility industry could impair the financial condition of many of our customers  which could cause them to reduce their capital expenditures and demand for our services 
skilled labor shortages and increased labor costs could negatively affect our ability to compete for new projects 
in our electrical construction business  we have from time to time experienced shortages of certain types of qualified personnel 
the commencement of new  large scale infrastructure projects  increased demand for infrastructure improvements  and the aging utility workforce also deplete the pool of skilled labor available to us  even if we are not awarded such projects 
as a result of these factors  the supply of experienced linemen and supervisors may not be sufficient to meet our expected demand and we may not be able to allocate or hire sufficient project managers for new electrical construction projects 
we may also spend considerable resources training employees who may then be hired by our competitors  forcing us to spend additional funds to attract personnel to fill those positions 
if we were unable to retain sufficient qualified personnel at a reasonable cost  or at all  we would be unable to staff new and existing projects  which would reduce our revenue 
our use of percentage of completion accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits 
as discussed in critical accounting estimates and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein  a significant portion of our revenue in our electrical construction operations is recognized on a percentage of completion method of accounting  using the cost to cost method  which is standard for fixed price contracts 
for the percentage of completion accounting practice  we use results in our recognizing contract revenue and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenue  costs and profitability 
the cost of labor and materials  however  may vary from the costs we originally estimated 
these variations  along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts  may cause actual revenue and gross profit for a project to differ from those we originally estimated and could result in reduced profitability or losses on projects 
depending upon the size of a particular project  variations from the estimated contract costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
we possess a significant amount of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings assets 
we extend credit to our customers as a result of performing work under contract prior to billing our customers for that work 
these customers mainly include gas and electric utilities and telecommunication companies 
as of december   we had net accounts receivable of million and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of  we periodically assess the credit risk of our customers and continuously monitor the timeliness of payments 
slowdowns in the industries we serve may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all 
furthermore  bankruptcies or financial 
table of contents difficulties within the telecommunications sector could hinder the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis or at all 
the failure or delay in payment by our customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity and profitability 
amounts included in our backlog may not result in revenue or translate into profits 
backlog for our electrical construction operations at december  and february   were million and million  respectively  which represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize from work to be performed on uncompleted contracts  including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun 
this revenue is not guaranteed  however  as many of our customers may cancel their contracts with us on short notice typically days  even if we are not in default under the contract 
in addition   of these uncompleted contracts are service agreements that contain multiple year terms which fall into the category of unit price contracts 
typically  these service agreements do not require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services and are cancelable on short notice 
for these service agreements  we project the backlog amount based on our historical work from each customer 
to the extent that our customers cancel their contracts with us or reduce their requirements during a particular period for any reason  we will not realize revenue or profit from the associated backlog 
furthermore  contracts included in our backlog may not be profitable 
we may experience variances in the realization of our backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from weather conditions  external market factors and economic factors beyond our control 
as a result  even if we realize all of the revenue from the projects in our backlog  if our expenses associated with these projects are higher than expected  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our projects are subject to numerous hazards 
if we do not maintain an adequate safety record  we may be ineligible to bid on certain projects  could be terminated from existing projects and could have difficulty procuring adequate insurance 
hazards experienced as a result of our electric construction operations include electrocutions  fires  mechanical failure and transportation accidents 
these hazards can cause and have caused personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment  and other consequential damages  including blackouts  and may result in suspension of our operations on a project  large damage claims  and  in extreme cases  criminal liability 
at any given time  we are subject to workers compensation claims and claims by employees  customers and third parties for property damage  loss of life and personal injuries resulting from such hazards or other workplace accidents 
further  regulatory changes implemented by the occupational safety and health administration could impose additional costs on us 
notwithstanding our investment of substantial resources in occupational health and safety programs  our industry involves a high degree of operational risk and we may be unable to avoid accidents resulting from the hazards described above and the associated liability exposure  which may be significant 
furthermore  if serious accidents or fatalities were to occur or if our safety record were to deteriorate  we could become ineligible to bid on certain projects and could be terminated from existing projects  our reputation and our prospects for future projects could be negatively affected  and we could be required to expend additional resources on health and safety programs 
in addition  if our safety record were to significantly deteriorate  it would become more difficult and expensive for us to procure adequate insurance 
an inability to obtain bonding would have a negative impact on our operations and results 
in certain circumstances  we are required to provide performance bonds to secure our contractual commitments 
although to date we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining bonding  if we were unable to obtain surety bonds in the future  or were required to post collateral in order to obtain surety bonds  our ability to obtain new contracts would be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
increases in the cost of fuel could have a negative impact on our operating margins 
the price of fuel needed to operate our vehicles and equipment is difficult to predict and changes based on events and factors outside of our control  including  among others  the supply and demand for oil and gas  war and civil unrest in oil producing countries  political developments and environmental concerns 
as a general matter  our fixed price contracts do not permit us to pass through additional costs associated with increases in fuel prices to our customers 
as a result  increases in the cost of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

table of contents delays in the receipt of materials could result in delays in the performance of our services 
there is an increased demand for fiber optic cable because our customers are expanding the capacity of their networks 
in addition  fiber optic cable suppliers have experienced and could further experience delays in the delivery of materials 
while there have not been significant delays to date  future delays could adversely affect the timing of the construction and maintenance services we provide to our customers 
our capital expenditures may fluctuate as a result of changes in business requirements 
our anticipated capital expenditure requirements may vary from time to time as a result of changes in our business 
increased capital expenditures will use cash flow and may increase our borrowing costs if cash for capital expenditures is not available from operations 
we may be unable to secure sufficient independent subcontractors to fulfill our obligations  or our independent subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations 
we utilize independent subcontractors to complete work on a portion of our projects 
if we are unable to secure independent subcontractors at a reasonable cost or at all  we may be delayed in completing work under a contract or the cost of completing the work may increase 
in addition  we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from  among other things  the quality and timeliness of the work they performed 
any of these factors could adversely affect the quality of our service  our ability to perform under certain contracts and the relationship with our customers  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
risks related to our real estate development operations we engage in real estate activities which are speculative and involve a high degree of risk 
the real estate industry is highly cyclical by nature and future market conditions are uncertain 
factors which adversely affect the real estate and homebuilding industries  many of which are beyond our control  include the availability and cost of financing  unfavorable interest rates and increases in inflation  overbuilding or decreases in demand  changes in national  regional and local economic conditions  cost overruns  inclement weather  and labor and material shortages  the impact of present or future environmental legislation  zoning laws and other regulations  availability  delays and costs associated with obtaining permits  approvals or licenses necessary to develop property  and increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees 
the homebuilding and condominium industry is in the midst of a severe downturn that may continue for an indefinite period and continue to adversely affect our business 
a continuing decline in the demand for housing coupled with an increase in the inventory of available condominiums and other homes could adversely affect our sales volume and pricing even more than has occurred to date and  as a result  could reduce our earnings 
the homebuilding industry is in the midst of a severe downturn and the housing market in our area continues to be characterized by high levels of foreclosed homes  reduced levels of consumer demand for new homes  aggressive price competition among homebuilders and increased incentives for home sales 
as a result  we  like many other builders  have experienced a decline in demand for new homes 
these challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and  in the near term  these conditions may further deteriorate 
we expect the continued weakness in the housing market will adversely affect this business segment as compared to prior periods and could result in additional inventory impairments in the future 

table of contents an oversupply of alternatives to new homes  such as rental properties and resale homes  has depressed prices and reduced margins 
this combination of lower demand and higher inventories affects both the number of new homes that we can sell and the prices at which we can sell them 
we have no basis for predicting how long supply and demand will remain out of balance in the market where we operate or whether  even if demand and supply come back in balance  sales volumes or pricing will return to prior levels 
changes in national and regional economic conditions  as well as local economic conditions where we conduct our real estate development operations and where prospective purchasers of our homes live  can have a negative impact on our business 
adverse changes in employment levels  job growth  consumer confidence  interest rates and population growth may reduce demand and depress prices for our new homes 
this  in turn  can reduce our earnings 
the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions such as employment levels  availability of financing for homebuyers  interest rates  consumer confidence  levels of new and existing homes for sale  demographic trends and housing demand 
if any adverse conditions affect our markets  they could have a proportionately greater or lesser impact on us versus other homebuilding companies 
an excess supply of housing  including homes held for sale by investors  banks and other lending institutions  can also lower new home prices and reduce our gross margins on new home sales 
as a result of the foregoing  potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes  or we may take longer or incur more costs to build them 
we may not be able to recapture increased costs by raising prices in many cases because of market conditions or because we fix our prices in advance of delivery by signing home sales contracts 
we may be unable to change the affordability of our homes to maintain our margins or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways 
in addition  cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog from time to time may increase if homebuyers sentiment changes and they may fail to honor their contracts 
the homebuilding industry is highly competitive and  if others are more successful  our business could decline 
we operate in a very competitive environment  which is characterized by competition from a number of other real estate developers 
we compete with large national and regional development companies and with smaller local firms for land  financing  raw materials and skilled management and labor resources 
we also compete with the resale  or previously owned  home market 
increased competition could cause us to increase our selling incentives and or reduce our prices 
increased competition could also result in an oversupply of condominiums or other housing alternatives available for sale  which could depress the prices at which we can sell our homes  and increase the length of time it takes us to sell them 
if a failure to compete effectively resulted in our selling fewer homes at lower prices  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
if land is not available at reasonable prices  our sales and earnings could decrease 
our real estate development operations depend on our ability to obtain land at reasonable prices for the development of our residential projects 
changes in the general availability of land  competition for available land  availability of financing to acquire land  zoning regulations that limit housing density and other market conditions may hurt our ability to obtain land for new residential developments 
if the supply of land appropriate for development of our residential projects becomes more limited because of these factors  or for any other reason  the cost of land could increase  which could reduce the profitability of our real estate development operations if we are unable to recover these costs in the sales prices of our homes  and the number of homes that we build and sell could be reduced  which would reduce our revenue 
if the market value of our land and developments drops significantly  our profits could decrease 
the market value of our land and completed inventories of our real estate development operations depends on market conditions 
we acquire land for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current market 
if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory  we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past  may experience less than anticipated profits  and may not be able to recover our costs when we sell our property or finished product 
in the face of adverse market conditions  we may have substantial inventory carrying costs or may have to sell land or completed units at a loss  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for example  the continued decrease in land sale activity  the lack of active comparable land valuations  and the continued delay in construction of the additional phases of the pineapple house project  prompted management to reevaluate our land carrying value as of december  
table of contents during the year ended december   we recognized an impairment write down to our real estate land property of  furthermore  if there is a decrease in demand for homes such that the market value of a home is less than the purchase price reduced by the deposit made by a buyer  the buyer may elect to forfeit their deposit to us and have no further obligation to purchase the home  resulting in a loss of revenue  operating income and a possible write down of our inventory 
government regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of our developments  increase our expenses or limit our building activities  which could have a negative impact on our operations 
we must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities in connection with our real estate development operations  and these governmental authorities often have broad discretion in exercising their approval authority 
we incur substantial costs related to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements 
any increase in legal and regulatory requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional costs  as discussed below 
various local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning building  zoning  sales and similar matters apply to and or affect the residential multifamily industry 
municipalities may restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities  such as water and sewer taps 
in some areas  municipalities may enact growth control initiatives  which will restrict the number of building permits available in a given year 
this governmental regulation affects construction activities as well as sales activities  mortgage lending activities and other dealings with consumers 
the industry also has experienced an increase in state and local legislation and regulations which limit the availability or use of land 
we may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law 
further  we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed developments  whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties 
increases in taxes or government fees could increase our costs  and adverse changes in tax laws could reduce customer demand for our homes 
increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees  such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools  open space  road improvements  or to provide low and moderate income housing  could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our real estate development operations if we are unable to recover these costs in the sales prices of our homes 
in addition  increases in local real estate taxes could adversely affect our potential customers who may consider those costs in determining whether to make a new home purchase and decide  as a result  not to purchase one of our homes 
in addition  any changes in the income tax laws that would reduce or eliminate tax deductions or incentives to homeowners could make housing less affordable or otherwise reduce the demand for housing  which in turn could reduce our sales and adversely affect our revenues 
our real estate business is concentrated in florida  which increases our exposure to local adverse events 
in our real estate development operations  we currently develop and sell homes only on the east coast of florida 
as a consequence  our exposure to local adverse events  such as natural disasters or changes in economic conditions  is increased 
in particular  florida is affected by tropical storms and hurricanes  which can damage or destroy buildings  including condominiums 
the occurrence of such a storm or other natural disaster could result in delays in construction and shortages and increased costs of labor and building materials 
any such delays or additional costs could adversely affect the profitability of our real estate development operations 
additionally  the inability of property owners to obtain cost effective insurance could have an adverse effect on demand for property in our markets  which could reduce our revenue 
furthermore  there are periods of time during which insurance companies will not write policies because of the presence of a named storm that may pass over the areas in which we sell homes 
during these periods  home closings in areas that could be affected by such a storm will be delayed until the risk of the storm has passed and the required insurance can be obtained 
adverse weather conditions and conditions in nature beyond our control could significantly impact our quarterly revenue and profitability 
in our real estate development operations  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  such as  but not limited to hurricanes  tornadoes  floods and fires  can have serious effects on our ability to perform work 
we also may be affected by unforeseen engineering  environmental or geological problems 
any of these adverse events or circumstances could cause delays in the completion of  or increase the cost of  our projects and  as a result  could adversely affect our sales  earnings and profitability 

table of contents in addition  approaching storms require that sales  development and construction operations be suspended in favor of storm preparation activities such as securing construction materials and equipment 
after a storm has passed  construction related resources such as sub contracted labor and building materials are likely to be redeployed to hurricane recovery efforts around the state of florida 
governmental permitting and inspection activities may similarly be focused primarily on returning displaced residents to homes damaged by the storms  rather than on new construction activity 
depending on the severity of the damage caused by the storms  disruptions such as these could last for several months 
if we experience shortages of labor and supplies or other circumstances beyond our control  there could be delays or increased costs in developing our condominiums  which could adversely affect our operating results 
our ability to develop residential properties may be affected by circumstances beyond our control  including work stoppages  labor disputes and shortages of qualified trades people such as carpenters  roofers  electricians and plumbers  lack of availability of adequate utility infrastructure and services  our need to rely on local subcontractors who may not be adequately capitalized or insured  and shortages  or delays in availability  or fluctuations in prices of  building materials 
any of these circumstances could give rise to delays in the start or completion of  or increase the cost of  developing one or more of our projects 
if we are not able to recover these increased costs by raising the prices of our homes we might decide to postpone or cancel the development of projects on which we have not yet begun construction 
if that happens  our operating results could be harmed 
additionally  we may be limited in the amount we can raise sales prices by our customers unwillingness to pay higher prices 
product liability litigation  warranty claims  subcontractors liability and subcontractor defective work claims arising in the ordinary course of business may be costly  which could adversely affect our business 
as a real estate developer  we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
these claims  which can include bodily injury claims and mold related property damage claims among others  are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly 
in addition  the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high  and the amount of coverage offered by insurance companies is currently limited 
there can be no assurance that this coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly 
if we are not able to obtain adequate insurance against these claims  we may experience losses that could have an adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition  which could be material 
we rely on subcontractors to perform much of the actual construction of our homes  and in many cases  to select and obtain raw materials 
despite our detailed specifications and quality control procedures  in some cases  improper construction processes or defective materials can occur 
the cost of complying with our warranty obligations in these cases may be significant if we are unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors  materials suppliers and insurers 
we also can suffer reputational damage  and may be exposed to possible liability  if subcontractors fail to comply with all applicable laws  including laws involving things that are not within our control 
because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters  we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage or our subcontractors insurance and financial resources  will be adequate to address all warranty  construction defect and liability claims in the future 
if we are not able to obtain suitable financing  our business may decline 
our real estate development operations depend substantially on our ability to obtain financing for the development of our projects 
if we are not able to obtain suitable financing  our costs would increase and our revenue would decrease  or we could be precluded from continuing our operations at current levels 
increases in interest rates can make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain the funds we need to operate our business  which would have an adverse effect on our profitability 
if our potential customers are not able to obtain suitable financing  our business may decline 
our real estate development operations also depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our real estate properties 
the mortgage lending industry has experienced significant instability 
as a result of increased default rates  particularly but not entirely with regard to sub prime and other non conforming loans  many lenders have reduced their willingness to make and tightened their credit requirements with regard to  residential mortgage loans 
fewer loan products and stricter loan qualification standards may make it more difficult for some borrowers to finance the purchase of our homes 
increases in the cost of home mortgage financing could 
table of contents prevent our potential customers from purchasing our real estate properties 
in addition  where our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a new home from us  increases in mortgage costs could prevent the buyers of our customers existing homes from obtaining the mortgages they need to complete the purchase  which could result in our potential customers inability to buy a home from us 
furthermore  changes in government sponsored entities involved in the residential mortgage market such as fannie mae and fha could affect mortgage rates  down payment requirements and our customers ability to obtain affordable financing  which could subsequently affect our customers ability to purchase our products 
if our potential customers or the buyers of our customers current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing  our sales and revenue could decline 
we depend upon the availability and skill of general contractors and subcontractors 
substantially all our construction work is done by subcontractors working for us or a general contractor we select for a particular project 
accordingly  the timing and quality of our construction depends on the availability and skill of those subcontractors 
we do not have long term contractual commitments with any particular general contractor  subcontractors or suppliers 
although we believe that our relationships with our general contractors  subcontractors and suppliers are good  we cannot assure you that skilled subcontractors will continue to be available to us at reasonable rates 
the inability to contract with skilled subcontractors or general contractors at reasonable costs on a timely basis could limit our ability to build and deliver projects and could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our real estate development operations 
additionally  if there is an impairment  bankruptcy or default by the general contractor or subcontractors  our production  revenue and operating income may be adversely affected 
we rely on outside professionals whose errors could increase our costs 
we often collaborate with numerous professionals such as architects  engineers and general contractors in the development of our real estate projects 
in the course of our business  we rely on the work of these professionals to help design and build the projects that we develop  and errors in their work can create significant increases in cost and delays in construction 
our revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future 
our revenue and operating results from real estate development operations are subject to fluctuations 
because we typically do not have more than one or two projects under development at any time  factors such as the timing of the start of construction of new projects  the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for development and construction  and others  can cause our revenue and operating results to vary from period to period and from year to year 
accordingly  the historical financial performance of our real estate development operations is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results for any particular period  and quarter to quarter comparisons should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance 
we may be subject to environmental liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations or the value of our properties 
the development and sale of real property creates a potential for environmental liability on our part as owner and developer  for our own acts as well as the acts of prior owners  current owners or past owners of adjacent parcels 
if hazardous substances are discovered on or emanating from any of our properties  we may be held liable for costs and liabilities relating to those hazardous substances 
should a substantial environmental hazard be found on any of our properties  our results of operations and the value of the contaminated property could be adversely affected 
increased insurance risk could negatively affect our business 
insurance and surety companies may take actions that could negatively affect our business  including increasing insurance premiums  requiring higher self insured retentions and deductibles  requiring additional collateral or covenants on surety bonds  reducing limits  restricting coverage  imposing exclusions  and refusing to underwrite certain risks and classes of business 
any of these actions may adversely affect our ability to obtain appropriate insurance coverage at reasonable costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents reduced numbers of home sales extend the time it takes us to recover land purchase and property development costs 
we incur many costs even before we begin to build homes in a community 
these include costs of preparing land and installing utilities  as well as taxes and other costs related to ownership of the land on which we plan to build homes 
reducing the rate at which we build homes extends the length of time it takes us to recover these costs 
risks related to our business environmental matters and climate change impacts 
we cannot predict with certainty whether climate change is occurring and  if so  at what rate 
however  the physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties  operations and business 
the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain 
climate change may result in  among other things  changing rainfall patterns  changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels 
because our operating results are significantly influenced by weather  substantial changes in historical weather patterns could significantly impact our future operating results 
for example  if climate change results in drier weather and milder temperatures over a greater period of time in a given period  we may be able to increase our productivity  which could have a positive impact on our revenues and gross margins 
in addition  if climate change results in an increase in severe weather  such as hurricanes  intense rainfall and ice storms  we could experience a greater amount of higher margin emergency restoration service work  which generally has a positive impact on our gross margins 
conversely  if climate change results in a greater amount of rainfall  snow  ice or other less accommodating weather over a greater period of time in a given period  we could experience reduced productivity  which could negatively impact our revenues and gross margins 
we are subject to numerous federal  state  local and environmental laws and regulations governing our operations  including the handling  transportation and disposal of non hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes  as well as emissions and discharges into the environment  including discharges to air  surface water and groundwater and soil 
we also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment 
under some of these laws and regulations  such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of previously operated properties regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time 
the presence of any contamination from substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations 
in addition  we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations and also could be subject to a revocation of our permits  which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
from time to time  we may incur costs and obligations for correcting environmental noncompliance matters and for remediation at or relating to our operations 
we believe that we are in compliance with our environmental obligations to date and that any such obligations should not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance 
climate change issues may result in the adoption of new environmental regulations that may unfavorably impact us  our suppliers  our customers  and subsequently effect how we conduct our businesses 
this could also cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations  as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers  suppliers  or both  incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us 
these costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition 
in addition  developments in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties  equipment and our processes without a corresponding increase in revenue 
our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by the timing and volume of work under contract  changes in national  regional  local and general economic conditions  the budgetary spending patterns of customers  
table of contents variations in margins of projects performed during any particular quarter  a change in the demand for our services  increased costs of performance of our services caused by severe weather conditions  increases in design and construction costs that we are unable to pass through to our customers  the termination of existing agreements  losses experienced in our operations that are not covered by insurance  a change in the mix of our customers  contracts and business  availability of qualified labor hired for specific projects  and changes in bonding requirements applicable to existing and new agreements 
we could be adversely affected by the loss of key management personnel 
our future success depends  to a significant degree  on the efforts of our executive officers and senior management  including those of our subsidiaries 
other than with respect to our chief executive officer  we do not have employment or non competition agreements with any of our employees 
we believe that key members of our senior management possess valuable industry knowledge  relationships and experience that are important to the successful operation of our business 
the relationships between our executive officers and senior management and our customers are important to our being retained 
we are also dependent upon our project managers and field supervisors who are responsible for managing and drawing employees to our projects 
there can be no assurance that any individual will continue in his or her capacity for any particular period of time 
industry wide competition for managerial talent in electrical construction has increased and the loss of one or more of our key employees  could negatively impact our ability to manage our business and relationships with our customers 
the loss of any of our executive officers or senior management could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
acts of war or terrorism may seriously harm our business 
acts of war  any outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the united states and any foreign power  or acts of terrorism  may cause disruption to the economy  our company  our employees and our customers  which could adversely impact our total revenue and earnings 
we may not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we have determined that we are in a cumulative income tax loss position based on the guidance in asc topic  income taxes 
due to this cumulative loss position and lack of sufficient objective evidence regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
although we do expect to recover from the current economic downturn to normal profit levels in the future  it may be necessary for us to record additional valuation allowances related to operating losses 
valuation allowances could materially increase our income tax expense or reduce our income tax benefit  and therefore adversely affect our results of operations and tangible net worth in the period in which such valuation allowance is recorded 
we could be adversely affected by liabilities associated with our former mining business 
the company was previously engaged in mining activities  and ended all such activities approximately nine years ago 
however  we could still be liable for previous activities at sites we once owned 
the violation of our debt covenants imposed by our credit facility could impact our access to that credit facility and therefore our cash flows 
our debt arrangements contain various financial and other covenants including  but not limited to minimum tangible net worth  outside debt limitation  and maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio 
our loans also have cross default provisions whereby any default under any loans of the company or its subsidiaries with the lender will constitute a default under all of the other loans of the company and its subsidiaries with the lender 
although we are in compliance with all covenants  if we were to experience substantial consecutive losses  absent a modification of the loan agreement or a waiver  this could result in a violation of the financial covenants 
a 
table of contents violation of our financial covenants will give the right to our lender to accelerate our loans 
under these circumstances  there can be no assurance that we could obtain a modification or waiver 
the acceleration of all of our loans would adversely affect our cash flows and consequently our results of operations

overview we are a provider of electrical construction services throughout much of the united states and a developer of condominiums on the east coast of florida 
in addition  on an opportunistic basis  we also engage in single family homebuilding 
we report our results under two reportable segments  electrical construction and real estate development 
for the year ended december   our total consolidated revenue was million  of which was attributable to the electrical construction segment and to the real estate development segment 
through our subsidiary  southeast power corporation southeast power  we are engaged in the construction and maintenance of electric utility facilities for electric utilities and industrial customers  and the installation of fiber optic cable for fiber optic cable manufacturers  telecommunication companies  and electric utilities 
southeast power  headquartered in titusville  florida  performs electrical contracting services primarily in the southeastern  mid atlantic and western regions of the united states 
southeast power has recently opened a new facility in bastrop  texas  in addition to its facilities in titusville  florida  and spartanburg  south carolina 
the electrical construction business is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with other independent contractors  including larger regional and national firms that may have financial  operational  technical and marketing resources that exceed our own 
we also face competition from existing and prospective customers establishing or augmenting in house service organizations that employ personnel who perform some of the same types of service as those provided by us 
in addition  a significant portion of our electrical construction revenue is derived from a small group of customers  several of which account for a substantial portion of our revenue in any given year 
for example  for the years ended december  and  three of our customers accounted for approximately and of our consolidated revenue  respectively 
the loss of  or decrease in current demand from  one or more of these customers would  if not replaced by other business  result in a decrease in revenue  margins and profits  which could be material 

table of contents through our subsidiary bayswater development corporation and its various subsidiaries bayswater  we are engaged in the acquisition  development  management and disposition of land and improved properties 
the primary focus of our real estate operations has been the development of residential condominium projects along the east coast of central florida 
in addition  on a very limited and opportunistic basis  we occasionally engage in single family homebuilding 
our most recently completed condominium project  pineapple house  is an eight story building in melbourne  florida  containing thirty three luxury river view condominium units  of which only two units remained unsold as of december  it is the first phase of a planned multi phase development 
as of december   our recently commenced homebuilding operations consisted of two single family home properties under construction 
as of december   there were no real estate properties under construction 
our customers generally are pre retirement  retirement or second homebuyers seeking higher quality  maintenance free residences with generous amenities 
however  the housing market has experienced the most significant downturn in recent history 
the credit markets and mortgage industry have experienced a period of unparalleled instability  and this disruption has affected buyers ability to secure financing for home purchases 
foreclosures and distress sales continue to adversely affect market conditions 
increasing local unemployment levels is another factor affecting the real estate market 
as a result of these and other factors  we continue to postpone commencement of the next phase of the pineapple house project until market conditions improve 
we are unable to predict when market conditions will improve 
market conditions may continue to have an adverse impact on the sales and pricing of our real estate properties  the commencement and development of new projects and on the results of our real estate development operations 
we have completed the first phase of the pineapple house project on budget and in a timely manner  and believe the project is attractive and of high quality 
furthermore  we are no longer incurring construction costs with respect to this phase and our share of the holding costs on the unsold units is expected to be no more than  annually 
critical accounting estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to fixed price electrical construction contracts  real estate development projects  and deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management has discussed the selection and development of our critical accounting policies  estimates  and related disclosure with the audit committee of the board of directors 
percentage of completion electrical construction segment we recognize revenue from fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis  using primarily the cost to cost method based on the percentage of total cost incurred to date  in proportion to total estimated cost to complete the contract 
total estimated cost  and thus contract income  is impacted by several factors including  but not limited to changes in productivity and scheduling  the cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  site conditions and scheduling that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  client needs  client delays in providing approvals  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project  a change in the availability and proximity of materials  and governmental regulation  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and thus the timing of income and revenue recognition 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is almost solely dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project 
due to our experience and our detailed approach in determining our cost estimates for all of our significant projects  we believe our estimates to be highly reliable 
however  our projects can be complex and in almost every case the profit margin estimates for a project will either increase or decrease  to some extent  from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have a number of projects of varying levels of complexity and size in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability 
if a current estimate of total costs 
table of contents indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
accrued contract losses as of december  and  were  and  respectively 
for both the years ended december  and  the accrued contract losses are mainly attributable to transmission projects experiencing either adverse weather conditions or unexpected construction issues 
revenue from change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work and claims is recognized when realization is probable 
real estate inventory valuation real estate inventory  which consists of completed condominium units  is carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value in accordance with asc topic  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as of december   management reviewed the real estate inventory for impairment 
asc topic requires that if the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset are less than its carrying amount  an impairment charge should be recorded to reduce the carrying amount of such asset to its fair value 
the fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
in determining the need for recording any impairment on our real estate inventory  management reviews the carrying value of the remaining inventory 
management considers sales expectations and the historical pace of sales 
management also evaluates the margins of the property sold  current selling prices and any property under contract 
considering these factors  we establish three probability scenarios for the amount of inventory we project to sell over the next twelve months  and each successive twelve month period  until all properties are projected to be sold 
we estimate the number of properties that will be sold using  and levels of probability 
due to the fact that the estimates and assumptions included in our cash flow models are based upon historical results and projected trends  they do not anticipate unexpected changes in market conditions that may lead to us incurring additional impairment charges in the future 
additional factors considered in our analysis are unemployment rates  local real estate market trends  such as supply and demand  marketing incentives  and other local factors 
therefore  changes in the local economy highly influence our market conditions 
our most critical assumptions in our cash flow models are our projected absorption  which is analyzed based on our historical sales and current sales within surrounding areas  current selling prices and a discount factor 
we estimate the fair value of our condominium units by using a discounted cash flow model  which incorporates the probability assessments described above 
in estimating the cash flows for completed condominium units  we use various estimates such as a expected sales pace to absorb the number of units based upon economic conditions that may have either a short term or long term impact on the market in which the units are located  competition within our market  historical sales rates of the units within the project  and b expected net sales prices in the near term based upon current pricing estimates  as well as estimated changes in future sales prices based upon historical sales prices of the units within the project  or historical sales prices of similar product offerings in our market 
our determination of fair value requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with selling the assets and related estimated cash flows 
in determining the fair value of the remaining condominium units in our pineapple house project  we used a discount rate of 
in addition  we have applied sensitivity factors to our impairment analysis 
if our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change  we could incur impairment charges in future periods  which would decrease operating income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
for example  we performed a sensitivity test for the three key assumptions in our real estate inventory impairment test current selling prices  discount factor  and projected absorption pace 
based on these analyses  we determined that a ten percent decrease in the estimated selling prices of the properties in inventory  an increase of ten percent in the estimated discount factor used in our calculation  or a decrease of one unit in the estimated number of condominium units to be sold over the next twelve months  each calculated separately  had no impact on the carrying value of our real estate inventory as of december   or december   because even using these adverse assumptions  we still estimate the fair value of our condominium inventory to be at or above its carrying value  based on our discounted cash flow model 
as of december   our real estate inventory consisted of one condominium project with two remaining condominium units 
during the year ended december   two condominium units  or of the remaining units at the end of the prior year  were sold in excess of their carrying values and one additional unit was purchased and resold at its carrying value 
in addition  the units sold are similar to the units remaining to be sold 
we are selling at substantially our current asking price  which is in excess of our carrying costs 
based on the above  management determined that no impairment to our current real estate inventory was necessary 

table of contents other long lived assets valuation as described above  we carefully monitor the value of the real estate inventory  and we also regularly perform impairment analysis on the electrical construction segment s property and equipment balances 
in conducting our impairment testing  we have considered whether the decrease in our market capitalization below our book value should be a specific triggering event necessitating impairment testing 
we note that our market capitalization is significantly lower than our book value 
while market capitalization is an indicator of market sentiment on a particular day  the day to day share price of our stock at particular points in time may not  and frequently does not  fairly reflect the value of our significant assets  primarily the real estate inventory of our real estate segment and the investment in the equipment of our electrical construction segment 
we further note that in almost all of the past eighteen years our market capitalization has been significantly below our book value 
under these circumstances  we do not consider such market capitalization to be a specific triggering event necessitating impairment testing  particularly in light of the fact that we do not have any goodwill or similar intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet 
regardless  we review the book value of our assets on a regular basis to determine possible impairments in accordance with asc topic  even though we believe we will continue as a viable business in the future 
the continued decrease in land sale activity  the lack of active comparable land valuations and the continued delay in construction of the additional phases of the pineapple house project prompted management to reevaluate our land carrying value as of december  during the year ended december   we recognized an impairment write down of  to our land carrying value based on a fair value appraisal prepared by an independent third party 
there was no impairment write down to our land carrying value during the year ended december  specifically  in our evaluation for potential impairment  we determine the value of our real estate inventory  as well as our investments in electrical construction property and equipment using a fair value methodology  as further described in note organization and summary of significant accounting policies inventory  and note organization and summary of significant accounting policies property  buildings  equipment and depreciation  and in accordance with asc topic deferred tax assets we account for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes  which establishes the recognition requirements necessary for implementation 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
as of december   our deferred tax assets were largely comprised of net operating loss nol carryforwards  alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforwards and real estate inventory basis differences on unsold residential units refer to note to the consolidated financial statement 
the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be recovered or settled 
in the assessment for a valuation allowance  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with loss carryforwards expiring unused  and tax planning alternatives 
if we determine we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance would be recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
based upon an evaluation of all available evidence  we established a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets beginning in our cumulative loss position over the evaluation period was significant negative evidence in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
consequently  our future provision for income 
table of contents taxes will include no tax benefit with respect to taxable losses incurred  and limited tax expense with respect to income generated  until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated 
this will cause variability in our effective tax rate 
in the event we were to subsequently determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the previously recorded valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the table below is a reconciliation of our operating income loss attributable to each of our segments for the two year period ended december as indicated electrical construction revenue operating expenses cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative depreciation loss gain on sale of assets total operating expenses operating income real estate development revenue operating expenses cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative depreciation impairment of real estate property loss on sale of assets total operating expenses operating loss income revenue total revenue in the year ended december   decreased by to million  compared to million in the year ended december   mainly due to the decrease in real estate revenue 
electrical construction revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue for the year ended december   when compared to the same period in  was largely due to an increase in demand for our electrical construction services  particularly our transmission work  mainly during the fourth quarter of  partially offset by a decrease in fiber splicing in the varying magnitude and duration of electrical construction projects may result in substantial fluctuation in our backlog from time to time 
backlog represents the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under project specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under our existing service agreements  including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun 
in many instances  our customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services and many of our contracts may be terminated with notice  therefore we do not consider any portion of our backlog to be firm 
however  our customers become obligated once we provide the services they have requested 
our service agreements are typically multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical relationships with these customers 
our estimates of a customer s requirements during a particular future period may not be accurate at any point in time 
at december   the approximate value of uncompleted contracts was million  compared to million at december  we expect to complete of this backlog during the year ending december  we cannot project the levels of future demand for construction services 

table of contents since december   our electrical construction backlog has increased significantly 
we estimate the backlog at february   to be approximately million  with million expected to be completed during this backlog increase was in large part attributable to southeast power s expansion during of its geographical footprint into texas and establishment of permanent facilities there  with a view to obtaining work associated with the competitive renewable energy zones crez wind generation projects 
on february   southeast power was selected as prime contractor by south texas electric cooperative inc  to build a mile long kv transmission line  as part of a crez project 
southeast power estimates revenue of approximately million from this project  which is scheduled to be completed by july  we believe that work from other electric utilities and on other crez projects will provide a good opportunity for possible further growth in this region 
revenue from our real estate development operations decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was mainly due to the amount  type  and sales price of the properties sold during  when compared to during the year ended december   a total of three condominium units from our pineapple house project were sold and we had no residential property sales

table of contents liquidity and capital resources working capital analysis our primary cash needs have been for capital expenditures and working capital 
our primary sources of cash have been cash flow from operations and borrowings under our lines of credit 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million  as compared to cash and cash equivalents of million  and working capital of million as of december  in addition  we had million in an unused revolving line of credit as of december  this revolving line of credit is used as a working capital loan as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate that this cash on hand  our credit facilities and our future cash flows from operating activities will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our future operating needs and debt requirements 
cash flow analysis the following table presents our net cash flows for each of the years ended december as indicated net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash flows from operating activities are comprised of the net income loss  adjusted to reflect the timing of cash receipts and disbursements therefrom 
our cash flows are influenced by the level of operations  operating margins and the types of services we provide  as well as the stages of our projects in both the electrical construction and real estate segments 
cash provided by our operating activities totaled million in the year ended december   compared to cash provided of million from operating activities for the decrease in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to the changes in accounts receivable and accrued billings in the current period 
changes in accounts receivable and accrued billings increased to million from  when comparing the year ended december   to the same period in the change in accounts receivable and accrued billings is mainly attributable to the increase in transmission project revenue  mainly during the fourth quarter  when compared to the prior year 
operating cash flows normally fluctuate relative to the status of projects within both the real estate and electrical construction segments 
days of sales outstanding analysis we evaluate fluctuations in our accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  for the electrical construction segment  by comparing days of sales outstanding dso 
we calculate dso as of the end of any period by utilizing the respective quarter s electrical construction revenue to determine sales per day 
we then divide accounts receivable and accrued billings  net of allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of the period  by sales per day  to calculate dso for accounts receivable 
to calculate dso for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  we divide costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  by sales per day 
for the quarters ended december  and  our dso for accounts receivable were and  respectively  and our dso for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts were and  respectively 
the increase in our dso for accounts receivable and accrued billings was mainly due to the increase in transmission project revenue primarily during the fourth quarter  when compared to the same period in the decrease in our dso for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts was mainly due to certain customer provisions  which allowed us to invoice uncompleted projects in advance of completion during the fourth quarter in  when compared to the same period in as of march   we have received approximately of our december  outstanding trade accounts receivable and have billed of our costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings balance 

table of contents investing activities cash used in investing activities during the year ended december   was million  compared to cash used of million during the increase in cash used in our investing activities for the year ended december   when compared to  is primarily due to the increase in capital expenditures  during the current year period 
these capital expenditures are mainly attributed to purchases of equipment  primarily trucks and heavy machinery  used by our electrical construction segment for the upgrading and replacement of equipment  as well as expansion efforts within the segment 
our capital budget for is expected to total approximately million  the majority of which is for upgrading of equipment and purchases of new equipment  for our electrical construction segment 
we plan to fund these purchases through our current cash reserves and equipment financing consistent with past practices 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december   was million  compared to cash used in financing activities of  during the prior year 
our financing activities for the current year consisted mainly of net borrowings on our equipment loan of million  as well as borrowings on our working capital loan of  these borrowings were offset by repayments on notes payable of  for the pineapple house mortgage  and  on the electrical construction equipment loans 
our financing activities for the year ended december   consisted mainly of repayments on notes payable of million for the pineapple house mortgage   on the electrical construction million equipment loan and repayments on our working capital loan of  these were partially offset by borrowings made within the electrical construction segment of million and borrowings on our working capital loan of  used to purchase capital equipment and residential properties 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these borrowings 
we have paid no cash dividends on our common stock since  and it is not expected that we will pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the immediate future 
debt covenants our debt arrangements contain various financial and other covenants including  but not limited to minimum tangible net worth  outside debt limitation  and maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio 
other loan covenants prohibit  among other things  incurring additional indebtedness  issuing loans to other entities in excess of a certain amount  entering into a merger or consolidation  and any change in our current chief executive officer without prior written consent from the lender 
the loans also have cross default provisions whereby any default under any loans of the company or its subsidiaries with the lender  will constitute a default under all of the other loans of the company and its subsidiaries with the lender 
the most significant of these covenants are minimum tangible net worth  outside debt limitation  and maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio 
we must maintain a tangible net worth of at least million  no more than  in outside debt  and a maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio of no greater than we were in compliance with all of our covenants as of december  the following are computations of these most restrictive financial covenants covenant actual as of december  tangible net worth minimum outside debt not to exceed maximum debt worth ratio not to exceed 
table of contents forecast we anticipate our cash on hand  and cash flows from operations and credit facilities  will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our working capital needs  debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures  for at least the next twelve months 
the amount of our planned capital expenditures will depend  to some extent  on the results of our future performance 
however  our revenue  results of operations and cash flows  as well as our ability to seek additional financing  may be negatively impacted by factors including  but not limited to a decline in demand for electrical construction services and or real estate in the markets served  general economic conditions  heightened competition  availability of construction materials  increased interest rates  and adverse weather conditions 
the transmission projects associated with crez are typically much larger and of greater duration than those usually undertaken by southeast power 
these projects will require greater resources including equipment  bank lines of credit  bonding and personnel than encountered in our typical projects 
the company believes that it will have available adequate resources to complete any work it undertakes 
inflation as a result of relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the years ended december  and  inflation did not have a significant effect on our results
