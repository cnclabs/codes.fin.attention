table of contents overview npc and sppc are public utilities that generate  transmit and distribute electric energy in nevada and  in the case of sppc  also delivers natural gas service 
at year end  nve served approximately million electric customers  of which  electric customers primarily in las vegas  north las vegas  henderson and adjoining areas were served by npc  and approximately  electric customers in an approximate  square mile area of western  central and northeastern nevada  including the cities of reno  sparks  carson city  and elko were served by sppc 
additionally  sppc provided natural gas service to approximately  customers in an area of about square miles in nevada s reno sparks area 
major industries served by the utilities include gaming recreation  mining  warehousing manufacturing and governmental entities 
the utilities revenues and operating income are subject to fluctuations during the year due to the impacts that seasonal weather  rate changes and customer usage patterns have on demand for electric energy and services 
npc is a summer peaking utility  experiencing its highest retail energy sales in response to the demand for air conditioning 
sppc s electric system peak also occurs in the summer  with a slightly lower peak demand in the winter 
sppc s gas business typically peaks in the winter months due to heating demands 
npc and sppc service territories are as follows service territory beginning in  the utilities embarked on a three part energy strategy to manage resources against their load by encouraging energy efficiency and conservation programs  the purchase and development of renewable energy projects  construction of generating facilities and expanding transmission capability in an effort to reduce their reliance on purchased power 
this strategy was initiated at a time when the utilities were experiencing high growth which required significant capital investment in order to meet customer demands and also to establish self sufficiency and energy independence by building our own generating stations 
as customer growth and demand have stabilized  the utilities are transitioning from an emphasis on capital investment to an emphasis on optimizing our assets and resources 
a key element in the evolution of our energy strategy will be our ability to control both operating and maintenance expense as well as capital spending 

table of contents executing the evolution of the energy strategy the completion of the harry allen generating station marked a notable transition in the evolution of our strategy 
outlined below is the evolution of our energy strategy three part energy strategy evolution of energy strategy increase energy efficiency  conservation empower customers through more focused energy efficiency programs expand renewable energy initiatives and investments pursue cost effective renewable energy initiatives add new generation and transmission optimize generation efficiency and transmission engage employees to improve processes  reduce costs and enhance performance empower customers through focused energy efficiency programs the utilities will continue with the implementation of nv energize which not only provides metering and customer service operating savings  but will also provide customers with better opportunities to become more energy efficient 
nve s traditional conservation and energy efficiency programs  which have focused on behavioral change and technology replacement  will be enhanced by the new features enabled by nv energize 
customers will have access to better information to help them manage their usage and select from enhanced energy efficiency options  including demand response and pricing programs 
in  nve installed approximately  smart meters in southern nevada and expects to have million installed statewide by the end of the nv energize capabilities will allow nve to help customers implement the most cost effective mix of energy efficiency and conservation options that will also qualify toward fulfillment of the portfolio standard 
pursue cost effective renewable energy initiatives nve must strive to effectively balance the need to meet the portfolio standard  with the changes in load forecast and the uncertainty of renewable energy project development  either for financial or resource related reasons 
while nve is better positioned to meet this challenge based on recent renewable successes  nve remains committed to incorporating clean  cost effective renewable energy into its portfolio 
as part of this continued commitment  nve will continue to seek the best and most cost effective opportunities that will benefit our state  customers and environment 
depending on its needs and continuous analysis of the existing portfolio  nve has a number of tools available to seek renewable energy values for our customers 
these tools may include issuing requests for proposals for new renewable energy contracts  exploring opportunities to either jointly construct or develop projects using wind  geothermal and solar  undertaking additional short term purchases from existing renewable facilities and restructuring existing renewable relationships for the benefit of our customers 
the portfolio standard requires a specific percentage of an electric service provider s total retail energy sales to be obtained from renewable energy resources 
renewable resources include biomass  geothermal  solar  waterpower  wind and qualified recovered energy generation projects 
in addition  the portfolio standard allows energy efficiency measures from qualified conservation programs to meet up to of the portfolio percentage 
in  the utilities are required to obtain an amount of pecs equivalent to of their total retail energy from renewables 
currently  the portfolio standard increases to for and  to in  after which it increases to for the years through  and to for and beyond 
moreover  not less than of the total portfolio standard must be satisfied from solar resources until when a minimum of must be solar 
the utilities acquire pecs through competitively priced purchase power contracts  investments in renewable generating facilities and dsm programs 
nve seeks to meet the standard using the most cost effective means for our customers and to pursue the best value options that are available to the utilities 
in addition to the foregoing  this may also include economical short term purchases of pecs usually from outside of nevada to fulfill projected shortfalls due to the attrition or timing of development of renewable energy projects  weather variability or other supplier issues 
optimize generation efficiency and transmission facilities since  when nve began its energy independence initiative  we have added over  mws nominally rated of internal generation and  with the completion of harry allen generating station  nve may obtain approximately of its energy from internal generation 
in  nve s management will continue to strive to optimize the utilities energy portfolio in order to meet load obligations in a cost effective and reliable manner 
in addition  to the extent the utilities have the economical opportunity to sell excess capacity or energy  they may enter into such transactions to reduce overall energy costs 
nve anticipates it will have sufficient resources to meet its forecasted load requirements for however  resource adequacy could be affected by a number of factors  including the unplanned retirement of generating stations  plant outages  the timing of commercial operation of renewable energy projects and associated purchase power agreements  customer behavior with respect to energy efficiency and conservation programs  and environmental regulations which may limit our ability to operate certain generating units 

table of contents nve will continue with the construction of the on line which will enable us to optimize our transmission capabilities 
upon completion  the on line will connect nve s southern and northern service territories and  pending certain state and federal regulatory approvals  will provide the ability to jointly dispatch energy throughout the state and provide access to renewable energy resources in parts of northern and eastern nevada  which will enhance nve s ability to manage its portfolio standard  discussed above  and optimize its generating facilities 
on line is phase of a joint project between the utilities and gbt south 
the joint project consists of two phases 
in phase of the joint project  the parties would complete construction of a kv interconnection between the robinson summit substation on the sppc system and the harry allen substation on the npc system 
the utilities own a interest in on line and have entered into a tua with gbt south for its interest in on line 
the utilities interest in on line  which approximates million  will be allocated and to npc and sppc  respectively 
the utilities will have rights to of the capacity of on line  which is estimated to be approximately mw 
if gbt elects to construct phase  it would construct two additional transmission segments at either end of on line one extending from robinson summit north to midpoint  idaho  and the other commencing at the harry allen substation and interconnecting south to the eldorado substation 
gbt would pay for and own of phase facilities 
however  npc and sppc would have rights to additional transmission capacity from midpoint to eldorado for a total of approximately mw based on a rating of  mw for the complete path 
in february  nve announced on line will be delayed by at least three months 
on line was previously expected to be in service by december  the delay is attributed to addressing recent wind related damage sustained by some of the tower structures 
as a result of the damage and as a precautionary measure  the on line owners have directed construction crews to lay down certain existing tower structures and cease erection of further tower structures until the owners have completed an assessment of the situation 
other construction activities that are focused on safety and are unrelated to the wind damage are continuing while the owners work to resolve and repair the wind related damage  ascertain the root causes of the damage  and otherwise determine what project modifications will be necessary to ensure project safety and reliability 
as a result  nve is also delaying the merger application of the utilities 
engage employees to improve processes  reduce costs and enhance performance the utilities will continue to control operating and maintenance and capital costs through diligent review and process improvement initiatives by providing appropriate tools to our employees to find ways to reduce costs  improve processes  and enhance performance 
this is particularly important at a time when customer growth is low 
going forward this will continue to be an over arching theme of the evolution of our energy strategy 
our goal is to maintain  reduce  or eliminate upward pressure on our customers prices while always delivering safe and reliable energy and assure compliance with all laws and regulations 
business and competitive environment operations npc and sppc electric the utilities are charged with meeting the energy needs of nevada 
revenues are impacted by rate changes  cost of fuel and purchased power  seasonal or atypical weather and customer use 
the utilities electric peak demand occurs in the summer 
therefore  the utilities revenues and associated expenses are not incurred or generated evenly throughout the year 
to serve their customer base  the utilities generate electricity and purchase power in accordance with an esp  as discussed in more detail later in this section  under energy supply 
sppc gas the gas ldc is responsible for providing natural gas to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
sppc is well connected with several major gas producing regions and gas transportation systems into northern nevada 
sppc s gas distribution system receives gas supplies from two interstate natural gas pipelines  the paiute pipeline company and the tuscarora gas transmission company 
in addition  sppc has contracted for natural gas storage services to supplement firm and spot market purchases 

table of contents regulatory environment the ferc and pucn regulate portions of the utilities accounting practices and electricity and natural gas rates 
the ferc has jurisdiction under the federal power act with respect to wholesale rates  service  interconnection  accounting  and other matters in connection with the utilities sale of electricity for resale and interstate transmission 
the ferc also has jurisdiction over the natural gas pipeline companies from which the utilities buy transportation for natural gas 
the pucn has authority over rates charged to retail customers  the issuance of securities by the utilities and transactions with affiliated parties 
nevada state regulations require the utilities to file electric grcs every three years with the pucn to adjust rates  based primarily on cost of service and return on investment 
nevada state regulations also require the utilities to file annual deaa applications to either recover or refund electric balances that have been deferred and that represent the difference between fuel and purchased power costs actually incurred and the amounts collected in current retail rates 
additionally  the utilities may file to reset bters quarterly  based on the last months fuel and purchased power costs 
moreover  in  the pucn adopted regulations authorizing an electric utility to recover an amount from its customers that is attributable to the measurable and verifiable effects associated with the utilities implementation of energy efficiency and conservation programs approved by the pucn 
in addition  the regulation approved the transition of the recovery of energy efficiency program costs from general rates filed every three years to recover through independent annual rate filings 
the utilities filed their first rate case with respect to this new regulation  referred to by the utilities as the eeir and eepr  in october and will continue to file rate cases annually in march  thereafter 
in  the legislature passed assembly bill which allows an electric or gas utility that adjusts its bter on a quarterly basis to request pucn approval to make quarterly changes to its deaa rate if the request is in the public interest 
the utilities will still be required to file an annual deaa case to review costs for prudency and reasonableness  and if any costs are disallowed on such grounds  the disallowance will be incorporated into the next subsequent quarterly rate change 
the pucn approved the utilities filings to implement quarterly changes to their deaa rates 
see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements  for further discussion on the various rate cases 
the pucn regulations also require a gas supply report as well as a gas informational report to be filed annually 
sppc may also file gas grcs to adjust gas division rates including cost of service and return on investment 
rate cases are discussed in more detail in note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements 
competition npc and sppc electric the utilities operate under certificates of public convenience and necessity as regulated by the pucn  as well as franchise agreements with local governments in their respective operating areas 
under nevada state law  commercial customers with an average annual load of mw or more may file a letter of intent and application with the pucn to acquire electric energy  capacity  and ancillary services from another provider 
the law requires customers wishing to choose a new supplier to receive the approval of the pucn and meet public interest standards 
in particular  departing customers must secure new energy resources that are not under contract to npc or sppc  the departure must not burden the utilities with increased costs or cause any remaining customers to pay increased costs  and the departing customers must pay their portion of any deferred energy balances 
the pucn adopted regulations prescribing the criteria that will be used to determine if there will be negative impacts to remaining customers or to the utilities 
customers wishing to choose a new supplier must provide day notice to npc or sppc 
the utilities would continue to provide transmission  distribution  metering  and billing services to such customers 
currently  there are no material applications pending with the pucn to exit the system in npc s or sppc s service territory 
in the event a customer were to exit the system  we do not expect the departure to have a material impact on the utilities net income 
sppc gas sppc s natural gas ldc business is subject to competition from other suppliers and other forms of energy available to its customers 
large gas customers using  therms per month with fuel switching capability are allowed to participate in the incentive natural gas rate tariff 
once a service agreement has been executed  a customer can compare natural gas prices under this tariff to alternative energy sources and choose their source of fuel 
additionally  customers using greater than  therms per day have the ability to secure their own gas supplies under the transportation tariff 
as of january   there were large customers securing their own supplies 
these customers have a combined firm distribution load of approximately  dth per day 
transportation customers continue to pay firm and interruptible distribution charges 
these customers are responsible for procuring and paying for their own gas supply  which reduces sppc s purchases  but does not have an impact on net income 

table of contents sales in  npc s and sppc s electric revenues were approximately billion and million  respectively 
sppc s natural gas business accounted for approximately million in operating revenues or of sppc s total revenues 
npc s peak electric load decreased at an average annual growth rate of over the past five years  while sppc s decreased by 
in  npc s and sppc s electric system peaks were  mw and  mw  respectively  compared to  mw and  mw  respectively  in npc s total retail electric mwh sales have decreased at an average annual growth rate of over the past five years  and total retail electric mwh sales declined slightly in compared to as discussed below 
sppc s total retail electric mwh sales have decreased at an average annual growth rate of over the past five years primarily due to a decrease in mining customers discussed below 
npc s electric customers by class contributed the following mwh sales mwh sales mwh of total mwh of total mwh of total retail residential commercial industrial gaming recreation restaurants all other retail total retail wholesale sales to public authorities total total retail mwh sales decreased approximately in from  primarily due to a decrease in customer usage due to milder summer weather in and conservation programs  partially offset by a slight increase in customers 
npc s average residential and commercial customers increased by and  respectively  while average industrial customers decreased by 
although the unemployment rate remains above the national average in las vegas  the unemployment rate has improved significantly over the past year 
additionally  the economy in southern nevada has begun to see another sign of improvement  as visitor volumes begin to return to levels seen in before the recession 
however  population growth is likely to be moderate until the economy strengthens both locally and nationally 
sppc s electric customers by class contributed the following mwh sales mwh sales mwh of total mwh of total mwh of total retail residential commercial industrial mining all other retail total retail wholesale sales to public authorities total total retail mwh sales decreased approximately in from  primarily due to the sale of california assets on january  excluding california  retail sales increased in  which are now reported in wholesale mwh sales 
contributing to the increase in mwhs was a increase in residential usage primarily due to colder weather  and a increase in 
table of contents mining usage in excluding california  sppc s average number of residential and commercial customers increased by and  respectively  while industrial customers decreased by 
mining is a leading industry in northern nevada and comprises one of sppc s largest classes of customers 
in  sppc saw a decline in usage of mining customers as they switched to dos service  however  in and  mining customer usage increased as a result of a mining customer who restored operations in october and an increase in mining activity due to the elevated price of gold 
similar to southern nevada  northern nevada is seeing modest improvement in economic indicators and the economic recovery in the north is expected to be slow and dependent on the economy of neighboring states in addition to the national economy 
sppc has long term electric service agreements with eight of its largest commercial and industrial customers  with yearly revenues under these agreements totaling approximately million 
for  this represented approximately of sppc s electric operating revenues of approximately million 
such agreements include requirements for customers to maintain minimum demand and load factor levels 
in addition  they include provisions to recover all investments for customer specific facilities that have been made by sppc on their behalf 
commercial customers who receive approval from the pucn to acquire electric energy  capacity  and ancillary services from another provider  and who may have previously received service from sppc under terms of a long term service agreement  will migrate to being served under the provisions of a dos agreement 
under a dos agreement  customer specific facilities charges will continue to be collected along with a flat distribution charge per meter 
heating degree days hdd and cooling degree days cdd mwh usage may be affected by the change in heating degree or cooling degree days in a given year 
a degree day indicates how far that day s average temperature departed from f 
hdds measure heating energy demand and indicates how far the average temperature fell below f 
cdds measure cooling energy demand and indicates how far the temperature averaged above f 
for example  if a location had a mean temperature of f on day and f on day  there would be hdds minus and cdds for day in contrast  there would be hdds and cdds minus for day the following table shows the heating degree days and cooling degree days within npc s and sppc s service territories for each of the last three years change from change from amount prior year amount prior year amount npc hdd cdd sppc hdd cdd data source national weather service demand load and resources forecast npc s peak electric demand decreased in to  mws from  mws in sppc s peak electric demand decreased in to  mws from  mws in variations in energy usage occur as a result of varying weather conditions  economic conditions  and other energy usage behaviors  such as conservation efforts by our customers 
these variations necessitate a continual balancing of loads and resources  and requires both purchases and sales of energy under short and long term contracts and the prudent management and optimization of available resources 
the utilities plan to meet their customers needs through a combination of company owned generation and purchased power 
see the generation section and purchased power section below for details of the utilities generation and contracts for purchased power 
remaining needs will be met through power purchases through rfps or short term purchases 
as shown in the tables below  the utilities have sufficient resources to meet anticipated customer requirements 
however  resource adequacy may be affected by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the unplanned retirement of generating stations  the timing or 
table of contents achievement of commercial operation with respect to renewable energy power projects not yet commercially operable  as well as the intermittent reliability of renewable energy resources  customer behavior with respect to energy efficiency and conservation programs and environmental regulations which may limit our ability to operate certain generating units 
resource adequacy provides the utilities the ability to maintain a reliable supply of energy  however as discussed under resource optimization  to the extent the resources are not needed  the utilities will attempt to sell their additional availability in an effort to reduce costs 
below are tables as of december   summarizing the forecasted summer electric capacity requirement and resource needs of the utilities after consideration of energy conservation programs assuming no curtailment of supply or load  and normal weather conditions and the completion of on line  as discussed in the transmission section later  subject to change forecasted electric capacity requirements and resources mw npc total requirements resources company owned generation contracts for power purchases contracts for renewable energy power purchases  not yet commercially operable total resources total additional required additional resources includes projected system peak load plus planning reserves

resource optimization resource optimization entails the prudent purchase and sale of electric power  fuel and financial energy products by the utilities 
the utilities optimize their portfolios continuously in order to meet load obligations in a cost effective and reliable manner within transmission constraints 
the utilities continuously monitor the resources available to meet load obligations  recognizing the uncertainty not only in system conditions  such as planned and unplanned outages of generating or transmission facilities  but also in regional energy markets organized across different commodities  locations  demand and trading timeframes 
as conditions change and new information becomes available  the utilities optimize their portfolios as appropriate to account for changes in load  cost  volatility  reliability and other commercial or technical factors

table of contents npc is a member of the srsg and the wspp 
npc s membership in the srsg has allowed it to network with other utilities in an effort to use its resources more efficiently in the sharing of responsibilities for reserves 
npc s credit standing may affect the terms under which npc is able to purchase fuel and electricity in the western energy markets  however  as a result of npc s investment grade credit rating over the last several years  this was not a significant factor in sppc electric sppc purchases both forward firm energy and spot market energy based on economics  regulatory requirements  operating reserve margins  and unit availability

sppc is a member of the nwpp and wspp 
these pools have provided sppc further access to reserves and spot market power  respectively  in the pacific northwest and southwest 
in turn  sppc s generation resources provide a backup source for other pool members who rely heavily on hydroelectric systems 
sppc s credit standing may affect the terms under which sppc is able to purchase fuel and electricity in the western energy markets  however  as a result of sppc s investment grade credit rating over the last several years  this was not a significant factor in transmission electric transmission systems deliver energy from electric generators to distribution systems for final delivery to customers 
transmission systems are designed to move electricity over long distances because generators can be located anywhere from a few miles to hundreds of miles from customers 
the utilities electric transmission systems are part of the western interconnection  the regional grid in the west 
the western interconnection includes the interconnected transmission systems of fourteen western states  two canadian provinces and the parts of mexico that make up the western electricity coordinating council wecc 
wecc is one of eight regional councils of the nerc  the entity responsible for the reliability  adequacy and security of north america s bulk electric system 
npc s transmission system links generating units within and outside of the npc balancing authority area for delivery to the npc distribution system and provides interconnections with the balancing authority areas of western area power administration  los angeles department of water and power  southern california edison  and pacificorp 
sppc s transmission system links generating units within the sppc balancing authority area for delivery to the sppc distribution system and provides interconnections with the balancing authority areas of idaho power  los angeles department of water and power  southern california edison  pacificorp  bonneville power administration  pacific gas electric and plumas sierra rural electric cooperative 
the service territories of npc and sppc are not directly interconnected at present  however  in february  nve and the utilities entered into an agreement with great basin transmission gbt to construct on line  which will interconnect the systems for the first time 
under the nerc guidelines  the utilities are balancing authorities  transmission operators  and transmission owners among other roles 
as defined by nerc  the balancing authority integrates resource plans ahead of time  maintains load interchange generation balance within a balancing authority area  and supports interconnection frequency in real time ie  the balancing authority is responsible for assuring that the demands on the system are matched by an equivalent amount of resources  whether from generators within its area or from energy imports 
the transmission operator is responsible for the reliability of its local transmission system  and operates or directs the operations of the transmission facilities 
the transmission owner owns and 
table of contents maintains transmission facilities 
the utilities also schedule power deliveries over their transmission systems and maintain reliability through their operations and maintenance practices and by verifying that customers are matching loads with resources 
npc and sppc plan  build  and operate transmission systems that delivered  mwh and  mwh of electricity to customers  respectively  in their balancing authority areas in the npc system handled a system peak load of  mw in through approximately  miles of transmission lines and other transmission facilities ranging from kv to kv 
the sppc system handled a system peak load of  mw in through  miles of transmission lines and other facilities ranging from kv to kv 
the utilities process generation and transmission interconnection requests and requests for transmission service from a variety of customers 
these requests usually involve new planning studies and the negotiation of contracts with new and existing customers 
transmission regulatory environment transmission for the utilities bundled retail customers is subject to the jurisdiction of the pucn for rate making purposes 
the utilities provide cost based wholesale and retail access transmission services under the terms of a ferc approved oatt 
in accordance with the oatt  the utilities offer several transmission services to wholesale customers long term and short term firm point to point transmission service highest quality service with fixed delivery and receipt points  non firm point to point service as available service with fixed delivery and receipt points  and network transmission service equivalent to the service nve provides for nve s bundled retail customers 
these services are all offered on a nondiscriminatory basis in that all potential customers  including the utilities  have an equal opportunity to access the transmission system 
the utilities transmission business is managed and operated independently from the energy marketing business in accordance with ferc s standards of conduct 
the one nevada transmission line on line as discussed earlier  the utilities are currently constructing on line which would provide a kv interconnection between a new robinson summit substation on the sppc system and the harry allen substation on the npc system 
on line would further provide an interconnection between npc and sppc s system and enhance our ability to optimize the use of our generation and transmission facilities in alignment with the evolution of our energy strategy

table of contents regional planning the utilities are members of westconnect and the westconnect subregional transmission planning committee 
westconnect is a group of southwest transmission providing utilities that have agreed to work collaboratively to assess stakeholder and market needs and to investigate  analyze and recommend to its steering committee implementation of cost effective enhancements to the western wholesale electricity market 
the subregional transmission planning committee was established to provide coordinated transmission planning across the westconnect footprint  including the southwest area transmission group  in which npc participates  and the sierra subregional planning group  in which sppc participates 
ferc issued order on july  order establishes basic requirements for transmission planning on a regional and interregional basis 
the utilities are currently evaluating order and participating in various regional processes in order to comply with the order 
integrated resource plan the utilities are required to file irps every three years  and as necessary  may file amendments to their irps 
the irps are prepared in compliance with nevada laws and regulations and cover a year period 
the irps develop a comprehensive  integrated plan that considers customer energy requirements and propose the resources to meet those requirements in a manner that is consistent with prevailing market fundamentals 
the ultimate goal of the irps is to balance the objectives of minimizing costs and reducing volatility while reliably meeting the electric needs of npc s and sppc s customers 
the esp  discussed in detail later  operates in conjunction with the irp 
it serves as a guide for near term execution and fulfillment of energy needs 
npc electric in july  the pucn issued its order on npc s irp  which included the following significant items approval to jointly develop on line with gbt  an affiliate of ls power  discussed earlier in the transmission section 
the pucn also approved npc s self build option for on line if the companies and gbt were unable to reach agreement

energy supply planning general the energy supply function at the utilities encompasses the reliable and efficient operation of the utilities owned generation  the procurement of all fuels and purchased power and resource optimization eg  physical and economic dispatch 
there is the potential for continued price volatility in each utility s service territory  particularly during peak periods 
too great a dependence on generation from the wholesale market can lead to power price volatilities depending on available power supply and prevailing gas prices 
both utilities face load obligation uncertainty due to the potential for customer switching 
some counterparties in these areas have significant credit difficulties  representing credit risk to the utilities 
finally  each utility s own credit situation can have an impact on its ability to enter into transactions 
in response to these energy supply challenges  the utilities have adopted an approach to managing the energy supply function that has three primary elements 
the first element is a set of management guidelines to procuring and optimizing the supply portfolio that is consistent with the requirements of a load serving entity with a full requirements obligation 
the second element is an energy risk management and risk control approach that ensures clear separation of roles between the day to day management of risks and compliance monitoring and control  and ensures clear distinction between policy setting or planning and execution 
lastly  the utilities will pursue a process of ongoing regulatory involvement and acknowledgement of the resource portfolio management plans 
within the energy supply planning process  there are three key components covering different time frames the pucn approved long term irp  which is filed every three years  has a twenty year planning horizon  the pucn approved esp which is an intermediate term resource procurement and risk management plan that establishes the supply portfolio strategies within which intermediate term resource requirements will be met  has a one to three year planning horizon  and tactical execution activities with a one month to twelve month focus 
the esp operates in conjunction with the pucn approved twenty year irp 
it serves as a guide for near term execution and fulfillment of energy needs 
when the esp calls for executing contracts of longer than three years  pucn approval is required 
in developing and executing esps  management guidelines followed by the utilities include maintaining an esp that minimizes supply costs and retail price volatility and maximizes reliability of supply over the term of the esp  investigating feasible commercial options to execute the esp  applying quantitative techniques and diligence commensurate with risk to evaluate and execute each transaction  monitoring the portfolio against evolving market conditions and managing the resource optimization options  and ensuring transparent and well documented decisions and execution processes 
beginning in october  the utilities suspended their hedging programs  however  prior to the suspension  it was the general policy of the utilities to purchase hedges three seasons ahead 
as a result certain hedges entered into prior to the suspension in october  did not terminate until as of november  all hedging transactions have expired or terminated and the utilities remain unhedged 
if deemed prudent  the utilities may still purchase hedging instruments in the event circumstances occur that may have the potential to increase the cost of fuel and purchased power 
energy risk management and control the utilities efforts to manage energy commodity electricity  natural gas  coal and oil price risk are governed by the bod s revised and approved enterprise risk management and control policy 
that policy created the eroc and made that committee responsible for the overall policy direction of the utilities risk management and control efforts 
that policy further instructed the eroc to oversee the development of appropriate risk management and control policies  including the energy risk management and control policy 
the utilities commodity risk management program establishes a control framework based on existing commercial practices 
the program creates predefined risk thresholds and delineates management responsibilities and organizational relationships 
the 
table of contents program requires that transaction accounting systems and procedures be maintained for systematically identifying  measuring  evaluating and responding to the variety of risks inherent in the utilities commercial activities 
the program s control framework consists of a disclosure and reporting mechanism designed to keep management fully informed of the operation s compliance with portfolio and credit limits 
the utilities  through the purchase and sale of financial instruments and physical products  maintain an energy risk management program that limits energy risk to levels consistent with esps approved by the ceo and the eroc 
intermediate term esps the utilities update their intermediate term esps annually 
in july  npc filed its esp update for the period  and in september  sppc filed its esp update for the period both plans were approved by the eroc and the ceo prior to submission to the pucn 
the summer needs of for both sppc and npc will be met through a portfolio mix consisting of self generation  forward contracts for power and peaking and seasonal capacity  or synthetic tolling based contracts eg  power prices indexed to gas prices while striving to provide the lowest cost energy within reliability and transmission constraints 
long term purchased power activities the utilities update their respective planning documents irps  esps  and the portfolio standard annual report on a regular and as needed basis to determine their energy and pec needs 
when the planning documents call for long term purchased power and or pec agreements  rfps are issued  bids are evaluated  and contracts are executed with the successful bidders 
contracts requiring pucn approval are submitted to the pucn as part of the irp or an amendment to an irp 
long term purchased power contracts are discussed in more detail earlier  under purchased power 
short term resource optimization strategy the utilities short term resource optimization strategy involves both day ahead and real time next hour through the end of the current day activities that require buying  selling and scheduling power resources to determine the most economical way to produce or procure the power resources needed to meet the retail customer load and operating reserve requirement 
the utilities commit and dispatch generating units based on the comparative economics of generation versus spot market purchase opportunities 
any amount of excess capacity or energy is sold in the wholesale market if opportunities are available and the market price is lower than the production costs  while any deficient capacity or energy position is filled by either buying on the spot market or utilizing available generating capacity 
the day ahead resource optimization begins with an analysis of projected hourly loads  existing resources and operating reserve requirements 
firm forward take or pay contracts are scheduled and counted towards meeting the capacity needs of the day being pre scheduled 
the day of resource optimization involves minimizing system production costs each hour by lowering or raising generating unit output or buying power and or selling excess power in the wholesale market all in order to meet the system load requirement and operating reserve requirement 
any sale of excess power priced above the incremental cost of producing such power reduces the net production cost of operating the electrical system and thereby benefits the end use customer 
the utilities endeavor to reduce the electrical systems net production cost by selling available excess energy when it exists 
real time resource optimization requires an hourly determination of whether to increase or decrease the loading of on line generating units  commit previously off line generating units  un commit on line generating units  sell excess power  or purchase power in the real time market to meet the companies resource needs 
in order to achieve the lowest production cost  the projected incremental or decremental cost of the next available generation resource options is compared to determine the lowest cost option 
construction program the utilities construction programs and estimated expenditures are subject to continuing review  and are periodically revised to include the rate of load growth  construction costs  availability of fuel types  the number and status of proposed independent generation projects  the need for additional transmission capacity in nevada  regulatory considerations and impact to customers  the utilities ability to raise necessary capital  and changes in environmental regulations 
under the utilities franchise agreements  they are obligated to provide a safe and reliable source of energy to their customers 
capital construction expenditures and estimates are reflective of the utilities obligation to serve their customer base 
gross construction expenditures for  including afudc debt  net salvage and ciac  were million and million for npc and sppc  respectively  and for the period through  were billion and billion  respectively

table of contents npc is a party to a joint development agreement with china mountain wind llc  an affiliate of res americas  inc  in connection with the china mountain wind project 
under the joint development agreement  npc participates in the permitting and development of the china mountain wind project near the nevada idaho border and has the opportunity to participate in the construction and ownership of the project 
the pucn has not yet approved the project  and as such  it has not been included in the above tables 
environmental nve  npc and sppc as with other utilities  npc and sppc are subject to various environmental laws and regulations enforced by federal  state and local authorities 
the epa  ndep  the southern nevada health district  and the clark county department of air quality and environmental management administer regulations involving air quality  water pollution  solid  and hazardous and toxic waste 
nevada s utility environmental protection act also requires the utilities to obtain approval of the pucn prior to construction of major utility  generation or transmission facilities 
from the beginning phases of siting and development to the ongoing operation of existing or new electric generating  transmission and distribution facilities  our activities involve compliance with diverse laws and regulations which address noise  emissions  impacts to air and water  protected and cultural resources  and solid  hazardous  and toxic waste 
our activities often require complex and lengthy processes as we obtain approvals  permits or licenses for new  existing or modified facilities 
additionally  the use and handling of various chemicals or hazardous materials including wastes requires release prevention plans and emergency response procedures 
as new laws or regulations are promulgated  we assess their applicability and implement the necessary modifications to our facilities or our operations to ensure complete compliance 
the most significant environmental laws and regulations  both in effect and proposed  that could impact npc and sppc are discussed below federal environmental laws  regulations and regulatory initiatives clean air standards the clean air act caa provides a framework for protecting and improving the nation s air quality and controlling mobile and stationary sources of air emissions 
the amendments to the caa impose limitations on the emissions of sulfur dioxide so  nitrogen oxide nox as well as other pollutants 
all of the utilities fossil fuel generating stations are subject to these limitations and are in compliance with current standards 
congress has from time to time considered legislation that would amend the caa to target specific emissions from electric utility generating plants 
the epa has also proposed potential regulations associated with these types of emissions 
if enacted  this legislation and or regulations could require reductions in emissions of nox  so  mercury and or other pollutants 
the caa programs which most directly affect the state of nevada and nve s electric generating facilities are described below mercury and air toxics standards mats in december  the epa signed for publication in the federal register a final rule regulating hazardous air pollutant hap emissions from coal and oil fired electric utility steam generating units 
the rule  referred to as the mats rule requires coal and oil fired electric utility steam generating units to meet hap emission standards reflecting the application of the maximum achievable control technology mact 
the rule becomes effective days after publication in the federal register 
compliance with the mats emission standards is required within years of publication of the rule in the federal register 
however  if an existing source is unable to comply within years  the ndep has the ability to grant up to a year extension  if additional time is necessary for the installation of controls 
the epa also noted that the clean air act provides additional flexibilities to bring sources into compliance while maintaining electric reliability  and published a memorandum on december  articulating the agency s intended approach with respect to sources that operate in noncompliance with the mats rule 
the final rule does not specifically list control technologies that are required to achieve the mats emission standards 
coal and oil fired electric generating units are required to meet the applicable hap emission limits using whatever control technology  or combination of technologies  they deem appropriate for their specific situation 
in general  control technology requirements will be a function of the fuel being fired and the performance of existing air pollution control systems 
based on a review of emissions data available from nve s generating units  as well as emissions data available from epa for similar sources  the utilities anticipate that so and or acid gas reduction will be required at sppc s valmy generating station  unit to achieve compliance with the mats standards 
at the present time  sppc believes a dry sorbent injection system may be a viable control option for unit  at an estimated capital cost of approximately million 
note that the actual cost could vary and will be dependent upon final engineering design 

table of contents currently  all four of the units at the reid gardner generating station  as well as unit at the valmy generating station are compliant with the mats emission standards  based on the current fuel blend 
however  nve and the utilities will continue to monitor the chemical coal composition utilized in these units to ensure continued compliance 
naaqs the caa requires the epa to set minimum naaqs for certain air emissions including ozone  particulate matter  so and nitrogen dioxide no 
the caa established two types of naaqs primary standards  which set limits to protect public health  and secondary standards  which set limits to protect public welfare 
most naaqs require measurement over a defined period of time typically one hour  eight hours  twenty four hours  or one year to determine the average concentration of the pollutant present in a defined geographic area 
when a naaqs has been established  each state must recommend  and the epa must designate  the areas within its boundaries that meet naaqs attainment areas and those that do not non attainment areas 
each state must develop a state implementation plan sip to bring non attainment areas into compliance with naaqs and maintain good air quality in attainment areas 
the naaqs that affect or potentially affect our utility operations are summarized below 
ozone naaqs in march  the epa issued final rules adopting new  more stringent eight hour naaqs for ozone 
the epa lowered the primary and secondary standards from parts per billion to parts per billion 
states are to submit plans to the epa  no later than  demonstrating attainment with the standard 
in letters to state and tribal representatives dated december  the epa has identified which areas it anticipates will be meeting the ozone standards and those which are not 
states  tribes and the public will have an opportunity to comment on these proposed decisions before the agency issues final designations in spring the las vegas clark county region is presently designated as non attainment but it  as well as the rest of nevada  could be re classified as attainment  based on the standard 
the next scheduled reconsideration of the ozone standard will likely occur in particulate matter naaqs the epa has developed annual naaqs for coarse particulate matter defined as particles of micrometers or larger and both annual and hour naaqs for fine particulate matter particles with a size of up to micrometers 
nevada counties are currently meeting the particulate matter standards 
however  the las vegas clark county and washoe county regions are in non attainment for particulate matter standards 
the epa is currently reconsidering the annual fine particulate standard  and if lowered as expected  new non attainment designations in our service territory could occur 
the epa has indicated its reconsideration of the adequacy of the annual fine particulate matter standard is expected to be completed in so naaqs on june   the epa established a new one hour primary so naaqs at parts per billion and revoked the hour and annual so naaqs 
the hour secondary naaqs was established at parts per million 
the epa expects to designate areas as attainment  non attainment  or unclassifiable in based on the existing monitoring network and modeling 
non attainment designations are expected to result in lower so emission limits for sources of so in or near those areas 
no naaqs on february   the epa established a new one hour naaqs for no at the level of parts per billion 
to determine compliance with the new standard  the epa is establishing new ambient air monitoring requirements near major roads as well as in other locations where maximum concentrations are expected 
although existing air quality monitors do not currently show exceedances of this new standard in the utilities service areas  additional community and roadside monitoring could result in the designation of new non attainment areas 
the epa intends to re designate areas as soon as  based on the air quality data from the new monitoring network 
in the february rulemaking  the annual primary and secondary annual no naaqs was maintained at parts per billion 
due to uncertainty regarding the potential stringency of any new naaqs related proposals  nve is not able to estimate cost impacts to its generating system at this time 
while the final outcome and timing for the epa s and or congressional actions cannot be estimated  the utilities continue to monitor the development of these standards and assess their potential impact on our generation fleet as new information becomes available 

table of contents regional haze rules in june  the epa finalized amendments to the july regional haze rules  thereby requiring states to develop sips to demonstrate compliance 
these amendments apply to the provisions of the regional haze rule that require emission controls for industrial facilities emitting air pollutants that reduce visibility by causing or contributing to regional haze 
states are required to identify the facilities that will have to reduce emissions through installation of emission controls  known as best available retrofit technology bart  and then set emissions limits for those facilities 
in  the state of nevada began its bart rule development and the proposed sip to implement the bart requirements was released in the first quarter as presented in the sip  the impacted bart units are reid gardner generating station units  and  ft 
churchill generating station units and  and tracy generating station units  and the submitted bart sip contains targeted emission rates and compliance with the state s bart program can be achieved through options such as retrofit of emission reduction equipment on the affected units  or retirement of those units 
the navajo generating station is also subject to bart and is currently awaiting an epa rule determination 
on june   the epa published in the federal register its draft proposal to approve nevada s regional haze plan as meeting the requirements of the clean air act 
however  in announcing its final approval in december  the epa opted to take no action specifically on the bart determination for nitrogen oxide nox at the reid gardner generating stations  stating that it intends to propose action on those units at a later date and take public comment in the future 
the epa s final approval did include the state s proposed bart determinations for so and particulate matter for reid gardner generating station  as well as the bart controls proposed for all of the other nve affected units 
given the final epa action in december  nve is implementing the approved portions of the rule which will require compliance by january  nve intends to retire tracy generating station units and and install retrofit controls on tracy generating station unit and ft 
churchill generating station units and a cost estimate is currently being prepared based on specific engineering specifications and designs 
it is anticipated that the epa will request additional information prior to making the final determination on the reid gardner generating station nox controls 
however  until the final determination is made  it is impossible to predict the effect the ruling may have on reid gardner generating station s generating units 
climate change the topic of climate change continues to evolve  and response to this issue brings with it significant environmental  economic and social implications for nve and other electric utilities 
potential impacts from proposed legislation could vary  depending upon proposed carbon dioxide co emission limits  the timing of implementation of those limits  the program design  the degree to which offsets are allowed and available  and provisions for cost containment measures  such as a safety valve that provides a ceiling price for emission allowance purchases 
however  the utilities contribution of greenhouse gases ghg from its current generation fleet is partly mitigated due to our fuel portfolio being predominately natural gas which emits approximately less co than coal 
the impact on nve and the utilities of future initiatives related to ghg emissions and global climate change remains unknown 
although compliance costs are unlikely to be realized in the near future  federal legislative  federal regulatory  and state and regional sponsored initiatives to control ghg emissions continue to progress  making it more likely that some form of control will eventually be required 
for example  california is moving forward with the adoption of a proposed state cap on ghg emissions and developing market based compliance mechanisms  including compliance offset protocols 
since these initiatives continue to evolve  nve has and will continue to identify projects that minimize or offset ghg emissions and believes that precautionary actions to limit ghg emissions are appropriate 
the epa finalized regulations in september that require certain categories of businesses  including fossil fuel fired power plants  to monitor and report their emissions beginning in nve has been reporting its annual ghg emissions since it joined the california climate action registry ccar in nve also reported ghg emissions before the reporting deadline of september  as required by the epa  nve will continue to report annual ghg emissions to comply with the federal mandatory ghg reporting program 
after a series of developments and rule proposals  in march of  the epa affirmed its position that the caa permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v permit programs are not triggered for a pollutant until a regulatory requirement to control emissions of that pollutant becomes effective 
as a result of this epa determination  new or modified plants that were subject to psd or title v programs had to address ghg emissions in new permit applications as of january similarly  ghg emitted above certain thresholds from existing plants were also covered under the title v program beginning in january currently  all nve generation facilities have operating permits that could require modification to comply with the rule if modifications are undertaken 
the extent to which this rule could have a material impact on our generating facilities depends upon whether physical changes or change in operations subject to the rule would occur at our generating facilities  future epa determinations on what constitutes best available control technology for ghg emissions from power plants  and whether federal 
table of contents legislation is passed which overrides the rule 
during  none of nve s generation facilities triggered the criteria specified in this rule 
on december  in a judicial settlement  the epa announced that it will propose first time ghg emission standards and guidelines for the power plant sector under the federal caa 
specifically  the agency expects to propose new source performance standards nsps and emissions guidelines for existing sources for the power plant sector by may it is reasonable to expect that the limits on ghg emissions imposed by the new source performance standards and guidelines for existing sources will have an impact on generating facility operations 
however  until the standards and guidelines are proposed  it is impossible to predict the potential effect on generating facility operations 
clean water act standards the epa administers rules establishing aquatic protection requirements for power generation facilities that withdraw and discharge large quantities of water from and into rivers  streams  lakes  reservoirs  estuaries  oceans  or other us waters for cooling purposes 
in consideration of the desert environment in which the utilities operate  none of the utilities generation plants employ once through cooling water intake discharge structures into public water bodies 
further  all of the utilities generation stations are designed to have either minimal or zero water discharge into the surrounding environment 
therefore  the various laws regulating once through cooling water intake structures and thermal discharges of wastewater from power generation facilities do not specifically apply to the npc and sppc generation sites 
the epa is currently developing revised effluent limitation guidelines and standards for the steam electric power generating industry  which the agency expects to propose in july the epa s revision of these guidelines is driven primarily by concern over wastewater discharges from coal fired power plants  but will also address discharges from ash ponds and flue gas desulfurization air pollution controls 
under the terms of a related court approved consent decree  the final rules must be published by january  it is reasonable to expect that the new guidelines will impose more stringent limits on wastewater discharges from coal fired power plants and ash ponds 
however  until the revised guidelines are proposed  it is impossible to predict the effect the revised guidelines may have on generating facility operations 
coal combustion product ccp management in  the epa released the text of a proposed rule describing two possible regulatory options it is considering under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra for the disposal of coal ash generated from the combustion of coal by electric utilities and independent power producers 
under either option  the epa would regulate the construction of impoundments and landfills  and seek to ensure both the physical and environmental integrity of disposal facilities  however  none of the utilities coal facilities currently manage ash in surface water impoundments  rather  these ash products are handled and processed in a dry form at both the reid gardner and valmy generating stations 
the utilities believe it is possible that the epa will continue to allow some beneficial use  such as recycling of ash  without classifying it as hazardous waste 
however  any additional regulations which more stringently regulate the management disposal or reuse of coal ash will likely increase costs for nve s coal generation facilities if the ability to recycle this material is impaired or current landfill disposal requirements are modified 
due to the uncertainties of how this material may ultimately be regulated in the future  the utilities are unable to predict the outcome any such regulations might have on their systems at this time 
remediation activities due to the age and or historical usage of past and present operating properties  the utilities may be responsible for various levels of environmental remediation at contaminated sites 
this can include properties that are part of ongoing utility operations  sites formerly owned or used by nve or the utilities  and or sites owned by third parties 
the responsibility to remediate typically involves management of contaminated soils and may involve groundwater remediation 
managed in conjunction with relevant federal  state and local agencies  activities vary with site conditions and locations  remedial requirements  complexity and sharing of responsibility 
if remediation activities involve statutory joint and several liability provisions  strict liability  or cost recovery or contribution actions  nve  the utilities or their respective affiliates could potentially be held responsible for contamination caused by other parties 
in some instances  nve or the utilities may share liability associated with contamination with other potentially responsible parties  and may also benefit from insurance policies or contractual indemnities that cover some or all cleanup costs 
these types of sites situations are generally managed in the normal course of business operations

risk factors risks related to nve and the utilities results of operations economic conditions could negatively impact our business 
our operations are affected by local  national and global economic conditions 
moreover  the growth of our business depends in part on continued customer growth and tourism demand in our service areas 
over the last several years  adverse economic conditions have created uncertainty within the capital and commodity markets  including availability and cost of credit  inflation rates  monetary policy  unemployment rates and legislative and regulatory uncertainty 
a continued high rate of unemployment in nevada may impact customers ability to pay their utility bills on a timely basis  increase customer bankruptcies  and lead to increased bad debt 
a lower level of economic activity  changes in discretionary spending  conservation efforts by our customers  and decreased tourism activity in our service areas have resulted in a decline in energy consumption  which has and may continue to affect our future growth 
our operating results will likely fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis 
electric power generation is generally a seasonal business 
in many parts of the country  including our service areas  demand for power peaks during the hot summer months  with market prices also peaking at that time 
as a result  our operating results in the future will likely fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis 
in addition  we have historically sold less power  and consequently earned less income  when weather conditions in our service areas are milder 
unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition 
changes in consumer preferences  continuation of current economic conditions both nationally and globally  war  and the threat of terrorism or pandemics may harm our future growth and operating results 
changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending in the las vegas portion of our service area could continue to harm our business 
we cannot predict the extent to which the current local economic environment or global economic environment  future terrorist and war activities  or pandemics  in the us and elsewhere may affect us  directly or indirectly 
an extended period of reduced discretionary spending and or disruptions or declines in airline and other travel and business conventions could significantly harm the businesses in and the continued growth of the las vegas portion of our service area  which could harm our business and results of operations 
our business operations could be adversely affected by cyber attacks or security breaches 
the utilities are subject to cyber security risks primarily related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive customer  employee and vendor information maintained by the utilities in the normal course of business  as well as breaches of their supervisory 
table of contents control and data acquisition systems and other computer based systems and networks used in the operation of their businesses 
a loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of other computer systems or networks could adversely affect the utilities reputation  diminish customer confidence  adversely affect the utilities ability to manage facilities  networks  systems  programs and data efficiently or effectively  disrupt operations  and subject the utilities to possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
while the utilities have procured insurance and have implemented protective measures designed to deter cyber attacks and security breaches and to mitigate their effects  there can be no assurance that such protective measures will be completely effective in protecting the utilities from a cyber attack or security breach or the effects thereof or that insurance will be sufficient to compensate third parties from damages that result from cyber attacks or security breaches 
the utilities could be subject to penalties if they violate mandatory nerc reliability standards 
the energy policy act of amended the federal power act to  among other matters  provide for mandatory reliability standards designed to assure the reliable operation of the bulk power system 
nerc established  and ferc approved  reliability standards that impose certain operating  planning and cyber security requirements applicable to the utilities 
the utilities have been  and will continue to be  subject to routine audits and monitoring with respect to compliance with applicable nerc reliability standards  including standards requested by ferc to increase the number of assets including cyber security assets subject to nerc cyber security standards that are designated as critical assets 
if the utilities are found to be in violation of nerc s mandatory reliability standards  the utilities could be subject to civil fines imposed by the enforcement entities  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
construction projects that we engage in are subject to a number of risks inherent in such projects  which could have adverse effects on our results of operations 
the nature of our business requires us to engage in significant construction projects from time to time  and each such construction project is subject to usual construction risks which could adversely affect project costs and completion time 
these risks include  but are not limited to  shortages of  the ability to obtain or the cost of labor or materials  the ability of the contractors to perform under their contracts  equipment  engineering and design failure  strikes  adverse weather conditions  the ability to obtain necessary operating permits in a timely manner  legal challenges  disputes with third parties  changes in applicable law or regulations  adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions  laws and regulations by courts or the permitting agencies  other governmental actions  and events in the global economy 
if we are unable to complete the development or construction of any construction project or decide to delay or cancel construction  we may not be able to recover our investment in the project and may incur substantial cancellation payments under equipment and construction contracts 
even if a construction project is completed  the total costs may be higher than estimated and or higher than amounts approved by our regulators  and there is no guarantee that we will be allowed to recover these costs in rates 
in addition  construction delays can result in the delay of revenues and  therefore  could affect our results of operations 
the ownership and operation of certain power generation and transmission lines on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued leases  easements and rights of way  which could have a significant impact on our business 
certain portions of the utilities generating facilities and transmission lines that carry power from these facilities are located on indian lands pursuant to leases  easements or other rights of way that are effective for specified periods 
the utilities are currently unable to predict the final outcome of discussions with the appropriate indian tribes and approval by their respective governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases  easements and rights of way 
risks related to nve and the utilities regulatory proceedings if the utilities do not receive favorable rulings in their future grcs or other regulatory filings  including energy efficiency recovery programs  such events may have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition  cash flows and future results of operations 
the utilities revenues and earnings are subject to change as a result of regulatory proceedings known as grcs  which the utilities file with the pucn approximately every three years 
in the utilities grcs  the pucn establishes  among other things  their recoverable rate base  their roe  overall ror  depreciation rates and their cost of capital 
for a discussion of npc s and sppc s recent grcs  see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements 
we cannot predict what the pucn will direct in their orders on the utilities future grcs or other regulatory filings  including energy efficiency recovery programs 
inadequate rates may have a significant adverse effect on the utilities financial condition and future results of operations and may cause downgrades of their securities by the rating agencies and make it 
table of contents significantly more difficult or expensive to finance operations and construction projects and to buy fuel  natural gas and purchased power from third parties 
if the utilities do not receive favorable rulings in the deferred energy applications that they file with the pucn and they are unable to recover their deferred purchased power  natural gas and fuel costs  including changes in prices due to suspension of hedging programs  they will experience an adverse impact on cash flow and earnings 
any significant disallowance of deferred energy charges in the future could materially adversely affect their cash flow  financial condition and liquidity 
under nevada law  purchased power  natural gas and fuel costs in excess of those included in base rates are deferred as an asset on the utilities balance sheets and are not shown as an expense until recovered from their retail customers 
the utilities are required to file deaa applications with the pucn at least once every twelve months so that the pucn may verify the prudence of the energy costs 
nevada law also requires the pucn to act on these cases within a specified time period 
any of these costs determined by the pucn to have been imprudently incurred cannot be recovered from the utilities customers 
for a discussion of npc s and sppc s recent and pending deferred energy rate cases  see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements 
material disallowances of deferred energy costs or inadequate bters would have a significant adverse effect on the utilities financial condition and future results of operations  could cause downgrades of nve s and the utilities securities by the rating agencies and could make it more difficult or expensive to finance operations and construction projects and buy fuel  natural gas and purchased power from third parties 
the utilities purchase a portion of the power that they sell to their customers from power suppliers 
if the utilities and or their power suppliers credit ratings are downgraded  the utilities may experience difficulty entering into new power supply contracts  and to the extent that they must rely on the spot market  they may experience difficulty obtaining such power from suppliers in the spot market in light of their financial condition  or the financial condition of their power suppliers 
in addition  if the utilities experience unexpected failures or outages in their generation facilities  they may need to purchase a greater portion of the power they provide to their customers 
if access to liquidity is limited to obtain their power requirements  particularly for npc at the onset of the summer months  and the utilities are unable to obtain power through other means  their business  operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
if the utilities cannot maintain the required level of renewable energy or procure sufficient solar energy to meet nevada s increasing portfolio standard  the pucn may  among other things  impose an administrative fine for noncompliance 
nevada law sets forth the portfolio standard requiring providers of electric service to acquire  generate or save from renewable energy systems or energy efficiency measures a specific percentage of its total retail sales from renewable energy sources or efficiency measures  which increases over time 
the standard also includes a specific requirement for solar energy that must be met on an annual basis by both utilities 
the required amount of renewable energy and available supply can fluctuate widely based on multiple factors  including customer energy use  changes in law or regulation  renewable resource availability  and the financial stability of renewable counter parties  making the ability to anticipate future renewable energy needs and supplies difficult 
in the event the utilities do not fully meet the standards in a given year  if the pucn does not exempt them  they will be required to make up the pec deficiency in subsequent years and may be subject to a financial penalty 
in  the utilities were required to obtain an amount of pecs equivalent to of their total retail energy from renewables 
the portfolio standard remains at for  increases to for and  and reaches in  after which it increases again to for the years through  and to for and beyond 
moreover  not less than of the total portfolio standard must be met from solar resources until  when a minimum of must be solar 
in the event the utilities do not fully meet the standard in a given year  if the pucn does not exempt them  they will be required to make up the pec deficiency in subsequent years 
due to periodic increases in the portfolio standard and increasing retail sales  the utilities must acquire increasing amounts of renewable energy 
since most of the utilities renewable energy requirement is met by deliveries from third party suppliers  the utilities success in meeting the increasing portfolio standard remains largely dependent on the ability of those third parties to meet minimum contractual obligations over the duration of the contract 
similarly  self owned generation and expected contributions from qualified conservation and energy efficiency measures would need to deliver and be certified by the pucn as forecasted in each forecast year 
in  the pucn issued an order certifying that both utilities had met the portfolio standard and the solar requirement and that npc had eliminated any previous deficiency from while both utilities were successful in with respect to the portfolio standard  the intermittent and variable nature of the renewable portfolio  together with the increasing required renewable percentage  means that future years may still be subject to uncertainty around the utilities ability to comply with the portfolio standard 

table of contents the utilities ability to access the capital markets is dependent on their ability to obtain regulatory approval to do so 
the utilities will need to continue to support capital expenditures and to refinance maturing debt through external financing 
the utilities must obtain regulatory approval in nevada in order to borrow money or to issue securities and are therefore dependent on the pucn to issue favorable orders in a timely manner to permit them to finance their operations  construction and acquisition costs and to purchase power and fuel necessary to serve their customers 
as of december   npc has financing authority from the pucn for the period ending december   consisting of authority to issue additional long term debt securities of up to million  to refinance up to approximately million of long term debt securities  and ongoing authority to maintain a revolving credit facility of up to billion 
as of december   sppc has financing authority from the pucn for the period ending december   consisting of authority to issue additional long term debt securities of up to million  to refinance approximately million of long term debt securities  and ongoing authority to maintain a revolving credit facility of up to million 
however  we cannot assure you that in the future the pucn will issue such favorable orders or that such favorable orders will be issued on a timely basis 
risks related to nve and the utilities environmental matters if federal and or state requirements are imposed on the utilities mandating further emission reductions  including greenhouse gases and other pollutants  or if national ambient air quality standards are modified  such requirements could make some electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate 
emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides  mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulations  controls and mitigation expenses 
certain congressional leaders  environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the us have also been focusing considerable attention on emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change and or regional air quality 
moreover  there are many legislative and rulemaking initiatives pending at the federal and state level that are aimed at the reduction of fossil plant emissions  as well as modification of the naaqs for ozone and other pollutants 
we cannot predict the outcome of pending or future legislative and rulemaking proposals 
future changes in environmental laws or regulations governing emissions reductions could make certain electric generating units  especially those utilizing coal for fuel  uneconomical to construct  maintain or operate or could require design changes or the adoption of new technologies that could significantly increase costs or delay in service dates 
in addition  any legal obligation that would require the utilities to substantially reduce their emissions beyond present levels could require extensive mitigation efforts and  in the case of co legislation or regulation  would raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels  particularly coal  as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities 
the utilities are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that may increase our cost of operations  impact or limit our business plans  expose us to environmental liabilities  or make some electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate 
the utilities are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations can result in increased capital  construction  operating  and other costs 
these laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses  permits  inspections and other approvals  and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals 
we cannot predict the outcome or effect of any action or litigation that may arise from applicable environmental regulations 
in addition  either of the utilities may be identified as a responsible party for environmental cleanup by environmental agencies or regulatory bodies 
we cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs 
there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all potentially responsible parties 
environmental regulations may also require us to install pollution control equipment at  or perform environmental remediation on  our facilities 
existing environmental regulations regarding air emissions such as nox  so or mercury emissions  water quality  coal combustion by products and other pollutants may be revised or new climate change laws or regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us 
revised or additional laws or regulations  which may result in increased compliance costs  including the adoption of new technologies or additional operating restrictions  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers 
furthermore  we may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary to our business 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain  maintain or comply with any such approval  operations at our affected facilities could be delayed  halted or subjected to additional costs 

table of contents risks related to nve and the utilities liquidity and capital resources lower than expected investment returns on pension and other postretirement plan assets and other factors may increase nve s pension and other postretirement plan liability and funding requirements 
substantially all of nve employees are covered by a single employer defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan 
at present  the pension and other postretirement plan is underfunded in that the projected benefit obligations exceed the aggregate fair value of plan assets 
the funded status of the plan can be affected by contributions to plan assets  plan design  investment returns on plan assets  discount rates  mortality rates of plan participants  pension reform legislation and a number of other factors 
there can be no assurance that the value of nve s pension and other postretirement plan assets will be sufficient to cover future liabilities 
although nve has made significant contributions to its pension and other postretirement plan in recent years  it is possible that nve could incur a significant pension and other postretirement liability adjustment  or could be required to make significant additional cash contributions to its plan  which would reduce the cash available for operating activities  and have a material impact on earnings 
refer to note  retirement plan and post retirement benefits  of the notes to financial statements 
as a result of the suspension of the utilities hedging programs  the utilities are subject to fuel and wholesale electricity pricing risks  which could result in unanticipated liabilities and cash flow requirements or increased volatility in our earnings  and to related credit and liquidity risks 
beginning in october  the utilities suspended their hedging programs  however  prior to the suspension  it was the general policy of the utilities to purchase hedges three seasons ahead 
as a result certain hedges entered into prior to the suspension in october  did not terminate until as of november  all hedging transactions have expired or terminated and the utilities remain unhedged 
if deemed prudent  the utilities may still purchase hedging instruments in the event circumstances occur that may have the potential to increase the cost of fuel and purchased power 
as such  fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on their cash flows and their ability to operate and  consequently  on our financial condition 
the utilities business and operations are subject to changes in purchased power prices and fuel costs that may cause increases in the amounts they must pay for power supplies on the wholesale market and the cost of producing power in their generation plants 
prices for electricity  fuel and natural gas may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose the utilities to significant commodity price risks 
increasing energy commodity prices  particularly with respect to natural gas  have a significant effect on our short term liquidity 
although the utilities are entitled to recover their prudently incurred power  natural gas and fuel costs through deferred energy rate case filings with the pucn  if current commodity prices increase  the utilities deferred energy balances will increase  which will negatively affect our cash flow and liquidity until such costs are recovered from customers 
the utilities are also subject to credit risk for losses that they incur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations to deliver fuel  purchased power  natural gas for resale or settlement payments 
the utilities often extend credit to counterparties and customers and they are exposed to the risk that they may not be able to collect amounts owed to them 
credit risk includes the risk that a counterparty may default due to circumstances relating directly to it  and also the risk that a counterparty may default due to circumstances that relate to other market participants that have a direct or indirect relationship with such counterparty 
should a counterparty  customer or supplier fail to perform  the utilities may be required to replace existing contracts with contracts at then current market prices or to honor the underlying commitment 
the utilities are also subject to liquidity risk resulting from the exposure that their counterparties perceive with respect to the possible non performance by the utilities of their physical and financial obligations under their energy  fuel and natural gas contracts 
these counterparties may under certain circumstances  pursuant to the utilities agreements with them  seek assurances of performance from the utilities in the form of letters of credit  prepayment or cash deposits  or reduce availability under the utilities revolving credit facilities for negative mark to market positions 
in periods of price volatility  the utilities exposure levels can change significantly  which could have a significant negative impact on our liquidity and earnings 
in the event the utilities credit ratings are downgraded below investment grade  the maximum amount of collateral the utilities would be required to post is approximately million 
additionally  the utilities shall reduce their availability under their revolving credit facilities for negative mark to market positions on hedging contracts with counterparties who are lenders under the revolving credit facilities provided that the reduction of availability under the revolving credit facilities shall at no time exceed of the total commitments then in effect under the credit facilities 

table of contents if nve is precluded from receiving dividends from the utilities  its financial condition  and its ability to meet its debt service obligations  pay dividends and make capital contributions to its subsidiaries  will be materially adversely affected 
since nve is a holding company  substantially all of its cash flow is provided by dividends paid to nve by npc and sppc on their common stock  all of which is owned by nve 
since npc and sppc are public utilities  they are subject to regulation by the pucn  which impose limits on investment returns or otherwise impact the amount of dividends that the utilities may declare and pay 
in addition  certain agreements entered into by the utilities set restrictions on the amount of dividends they may declare and pay and restrict the circumstances under which such dividends may be declared and paid 
as a result of the utilities credit rating on their senior secured debt at investment grade by s p and moody s  these restrictions are suspended and no longer in effect so long as the debt remains investment grade by both rating agencies 
in addition to the restrictions imposed by specific agreements  the federal power act prohibits the payment of dividends from capital accounts 
although the meaning of this provision is unclear  the utilities believe that the federal power act restriction  as applied to their particular circumstances  would not be construed or applied by the ferc to prohibit the payment of dividends for lawful and legitimate business purposes from current year earnings  or in the absence of current year earnings  from other additional paid in capital accounts 
if  however  the ferc were to interpret this provision differently  the ability of the utilities to pay dividends to nve could be jeopardized 
we cannot assure investors that future dividend payments on our common stock will be made or  if made  in what amounts they may be paid 
dividends are considered periodically by nve s bod and are subject to factors that ordinarily affect dividend policy  such as current and prospective financial condition  earnings and liquidity  prospective business conditions  regulatory factors  and dividend restrictions in nve s and the utilities financing agreements 
the bod will continue to review these factors on a periodic basis to determine if and when it would be prudent to declare a dividend on nve s common stock  however  there is no guarantee that dividends will be paid in the future  or that  if paid  the dividends will be paid in the same amount or with the same frequency as in the past 
nve s indebtedness is effectively subordinated to the liabilities of its subsidiaries  particularly npc and sppc 
nve and the utilities have the ability to issue a significant amount of additional indebtedness under the terms of their various financing agreements 
because nve is a holding company  its indebtedness is effectively subordinated to the utilities existing indebtedness and other future liabilities  including claims by the utilities trade creditors  debt holders  secured creditors  taxing authorities  and guarantee holders 
nve conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries  and thus nve s ability to meet its obligations under its indebtedness and to pay any dividends on its common stock will be dependent on the earnings and cash flows of those subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to nve 
as of december   the utilities had approximately billion of debt outstanding 
the terms of nve s indebtedness restrict the amount of additional indebtedness that nve and the utilities may issue 
based on nve s december  financial statements  nve s indebtedness restrictions would allow nve and the utilities to issue up to approximately billion of additional indebtedness in the aggregate  plus indebtedness that is specifically permitted under the terms of nve s indebtedness 
in addition  npc and sppc are subject to restrictions under the terms of their various financing agreements on their ability to issue additional indebtedness

item legal proceedings npc and sppc western united states energy crisis proceedings before the ferc ferc complaints in december  the utilities filed ten complaints with the ferc against various power suppliers  including enron  under section of the federal power act seeking price reduction of forward wholesale power purchase contracts entered into prior to the ferc mandated price caps imposed in june in reaction to the western united states energy crisis 
the utilities contested the amounts paid for power actually delivered as well as termination claims for undelivered power against terminating suppliers 
over the course of the last ten years  the utilities litigated and settled the termination claims with the various power suppliers 
the utilities had previously negotiated settlements with duke energy trading and marketing  morgan stanley capital group  el paso merchant energy  now known as el paso marketing lp  calpine energy services and enron

table of contents executive overview management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations explains the general financial condition and the results of operations of nve and its two primary subsidiaries  npc and sppc  collectively referred to as the utilities references to we  us and our refer to nve and the utilities collectively  and includes discussion of the following critical accounting policies and estimates recent pronouncements for each of nve  npc and sppc results of operations analysis of cash flows liquidity and capital resources regulatory proceedings utilities nve s utilities operate three regulated business segments which are npc electric  sppc electric and sppc natural gas 
the utilities are public utilities engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity and  in the case of sppc  sale of natural gas 
other operations consist mainly of unregulated operations and the holding company operations 
the utilities are the principal operating subsidiaries of nve and account for substantially all of nve s assets and revenues 
nve  npc and sppc are separate filers for sec reporting purposes and as such this discussion has been divided to reflect the individual filers nve  npc and sppc  except for discussions that relate to all three entities or the utilities 
the utilities are regulated by the pucn with respect to rates  standards of service  siting of and necessity for generation and certain transmission facilities  accounting  issuance of securities and other matters with respect to generation  distribution and transmission operations 
the ferc has jurisdiction under the federal power act with respect to wholesale rates  service  interconnection  accounting  and other matters in connection with the utilities sale of electricity for resale and interstate transmission 
the ferc also has jurisdiction over the natural gas pipeline companies from which the utilities take service 
as a result of regulation  many of the fundamental business decisions of the utilities  as well as the ror they are permitted to earn on their utility assets  are subject to the approval of governmental agencies 
the utilities revenues and operating income are subject to fluctuations during the year due to impacts that seasonal weather  rate changes  and customer usage patterns have on demand for electric energy and resources 
npc is a summer peaking utility experiencing its highest retail energy sales in response to the demand for air conditioning 
sppc s electric system peak typically occurs in the summer  while its gas business typically peaks in the winter 
the variations in energy usage due to varying weather  customer growth and other energy usage patterns  including energy efficiency and conservation measures  necessitates a continual balancing of loads and resources and purchases and sales of energy under short and long term contracts 
as a result  the prudent management and optimization of available resources has a direct effect on the operating and financial performance of the utilities 
additionally  the timely recovery of purchased power and fuel costs  and other costs  and the ability to earn a fair return on investments are essential to the operating and financial performance of the utilities 
overview of major factors affecting results of operations nve recognized net income of million in compared to million in the decrease in net income is primarily due to the completion of the expansion at the harry allen generating station in may  which resulted in a decrease in afudc  an increase in depreciation expense and other operating and maintenance costs which were not recovered in rates 
as a result of the pucn s final order on npc s grc  costs associated with harry allen generating station are included in rates as of january  further contributing to the decrease in net income is a decrease in gross margin  adjustments as a result of the pucn final order on npc s grc  performance pay adjustments  maintenance at reid gardner generating station  an adjustment for revenue recorded in as a result of the pucn s final decision on the eeir rate and the recognition of income in for the sale of independence lake and legal settlements 
partially offsetting these decreases in net income was a favorable settlement in with a vendor on a long term service agreement for the higgins generating station  which was accrued for in the third quarter further offsetting the decrease in net income was a decrease in interest expense and reduced operating expenses 
nve recognized net income of million in compared to million in the increase in net income is primarily due to an increase in gross margin  which is primarily due to npc s increased rates as a result of npc s grc  effective july  see note  segment information  of the notes to financial statements 
also contributing to the increase in net income was lower operating expenses in compared to primarily due to a decrease in employee pension and benefit expenses and costs incurred in related to severance programs 
see note  severance programs  of the notes to financial statements 
partially offsetting the increase in net income was higher income taxes as a result of a lower tax effective rate in  an increase in interest expense on regulatory items primarily as a result of over collected deferred energy balances and interest charges 
table of contents related to nve s redemption of million of its senior notes due  and million of its senior notes due and increased depreciation expense 
accomplishments three part strategy in  nve continued the execution of its three part strategy  discussed in detail later  to manage resources against our load by encouraging energy efficiency and conservation programs  the purchase and development of renewable energy projects  and the construction of generating facilities  in an effort to reduce our reliance on purchased power  and expansion of transmission capabilities 
accomplishments under the three part strategy include energy efficiency and conservation programs in july  the eepr became effective 
the eepr changed the recovery of energy efficiency program costs from general rates filed every years to recovery through independent annual rate filings 
in july  the eeir became effective 
the eeir allows an electric utility to recover lost revenue that is attributable to the measurable and verifiable effects associated with the implementation of efficiency and conservation programs approved by the pucn 
in  the doe awarded a million grant in stimulus funding  made available through the american recovery and reinvestment act specifically for nve s million nv energize project 
the project will deploy the smart grid infrastructure necessary to enable the achievement of metering and customer service operating savings  enable the expansion of demand response and energy efficiency benefits  and provide customers better information to help manage their energy usage 
in  nve installed approximately  smart meters in southern nevada and expects to install million statewide by the end of purchase and development of renewable energy resources in  the pucn issued an order certifying that both utilities had met the portfolio standard and the solar requirement and that npc had eliminated any previous deficiency from construction of generating facilities and expansion of transmission capabilities in june  npc completed construction of the mw nominally rated natural gas generating station at the existing harry allen generating station 
in february  nve and the utilities achieved financial closing under a tua with gbt south  formerly entered into with gbt  to jointly construct and own on line  a kv transmission line 
regulatory the pucn issued its order on npc s grc in december  which resulted in the following significant items increase in general rates of million  approximately an overall increase effective january  roe and ror of and  respectively 
recovery of approximately million  excluding afudc  for the mw nominally rated expansion at the harry allen generating station 
recovery of approximately million for eec project development costs 
recovery of approximately million for demand side management costs 
recovery of approximately million for mohave generating station closure costs 
in addition to those items discussed above  reference note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements  for further discussion of additional npc grc items 
also  in the legislature passed assembly bill which allows an electric or gas utility that adjusts its bter on a quarterly basis to request pucn approval to make quarterly changes to its deaa rate if the request is in the public interest 
under this law  the utilities began filing applications to reset their deaa rates to reduce regulatory lag 
future challenges in  nve and the utilities must continue to balance the needs of our customers and regulatory requirements while still providing value to our shareholders 
the utilities three part strategy was initiated at a time when the utilities were experiencing high 
table of contents growth which required significant capital investment in order to meet customer demands and also to establish self sufficiency and energy independence by building our own generating stations 
as customer growth and demand have stabilized  the utilities are transitioning from an emphasis on capital investment to an emphasis on optimizing our assets and resources 
this transition is effected by certain challenges including economic conditions in nevada  executing the evolution of energy strategy  and managing regulatory environment 
economic conditions economic conditions in nevada continue to show mixed activity  however  leading economic indicators for nevada and southern nevada suggest that economic conditions can be expected to improve  although very slowly 
although the unemployment rate remains above the national average  the unemployment rate has improved significantly over the past year 
additionally  the economy in southern nevada has begun to see another sign of improvement  as visitor volumes begin to return to levels seen in before the recession 
economic conditions in nevada have significant influence on nve s business decisions as we consider various interrelated factors including customer growth  customer usage  load factors  managing operating and maintenance expenses within projected revenue without compromising safety  reliability and efficiency  pressure on regulators to limit necessary rate increases or otherwise lessen rate impacts upon customers  collections on accounts receivable  and future capital projects and capital requirements 
executing the evolution of the energy strategy outlined below is the evolution of our energy strategy three part energy strategy evolution of energy strategy increase energy efficiency  conservation empower customers through more focused energy efficiency programs expand renewable energy initiatives and investments pursue cost effective renewable energy initiatives add new generation and transmission optimize generation efficiency and transmission engage employees to improve processes  reduce costs  and enhance performance empower customers through focused energy efficiency programs the utilities will continue with the implementation of nv energize which not only provides metering and customer service operating savings  but will also provide customers with better opportunities to become more energy efficient 
nve s traditional conservation and energy efficiency programs  which have focused on behavioral change and technology replacement  will be enhanced by the new features enabled by nv energize 
customers will have access to better information to help them manage their usage and select from enhanced energy efficiency options  including demand response and pricing programs 
nve has installed approximately  smart meters in southern nevada and expects to have million installed statewide by the end of the nv energize capabilities will allow nve to help customers implement the most cost effective mix of energy efficiency and conservation options that will also qualify toward fulfillment of the portfolio standard 
pursue cost effective renewable energy initiatives nve must strive to effectively balance the need to meet the portfolio standard  with the changes in load forecast and the uncertainty of renewable energy project development  either for financial or resource related reasons 
while nve is better positioned to meet this challenge based on recent renewable successes  nve remains committed to incorporating clean  cost effective renewable energy into its portfolio 
as part of this continued commitment  nve will continue to seek the best and most cost effective opportunities that will benefit our state  customers and environment 
depending on its needs and continuous analysis of the existing portfolio  nve has a number of tools available to seek renewable energy values for our customers 
these tools may include issuing requests for proposals for new renewable energy contracts  exploring opportunities to either jointly construct or develop projects using 
table of contents wind  geothermal and solar  undertaking additional short term purchases from existing renewable facilities and restructuring existing renewable relationships for the benefit of our customers 
the portfolio standard requires a specific percentage of an electric service provider s total retail energy sales to be obtained from renewable energy resources 
renewable resources include biomass  geothermal  solar  waterpower  wind and qualified recovered energy generation projects 
in addition  the portfolio standard allows energy efficiency measures from qualified conservation programs to meet up to of the portfolio percentage 
in and  the utilities are required to obtain an amount of pecs equivalent to of their total retail energy from renewables 
currently  the portfolio standard increases to for and  to in  after which it increases to for the years through  and to for and beyond 
moreover  not less than of the total portfolio standard must be satisfied from solar resources until when a minimum of must be solar 
the utilities acquire pecs through competitively priced purchase power contracts  investments in renewable generating facilities and dsm programs 
nve seeks to meet the standard using the most cost effective means for our customers and to pursue the best value options that are available to the utilities 
in addition to the foregoing  this may also include economical short term purchases of pecs usually from outside of nevada to fulfill projected shortfalls due to the attrition or timing of development of renewable energy projects  weather variability or other supplier issues 
optimize generation efficiency and transmission facilities since  when nve began its energy independence initiative  we have added over  mws nominally rated of internal generation and  with the completion of harry allen generating station  nve may obtain approximately of its energy from internal generation 
in  nve s management will continue to strive to optimize the utilities energy portfolio in order to meet load obligations in a cost effective and reliable manner 
in addition  to the extent the utilities have the economical opportunity to sell excess capacity or energy  they may enter into such transactions to reduce overall energy costs 
nve anticipates it will have sufficient resources to meet its forecasted load requirements for however  resource adequacy could be affected by a number of factors  including the unplanned retirement of generating stations  plant outages  the timing of commercial operation of renewable energy projects and associated purchase power agreements  customer behavior with respect to energy efficiency and conservation programs  and environmental regulations which may limit our ability to operate certain generating units 
nve will continue with the construction of the on line which will enable us to optimize our transmission capabilities 
upon completion  the on line will connect nve s southern and northern service territories and  pending certain state and federal regulatory approvals  will provide the ability to jointly dispatch energy throughout the state and provide access to renewable energy resources in parts of northern and eastern nevada  which will enhance nve s ability to manage its portfolio standard  discussed above  and optimize its generating facilities 
on line is phase of a joint project between the utilities and gbt south 
the joint project consists of two phases 
in phase of the joint project  the parties would complete construction of a kv interconnection between the robinson summit substation on the sppc system and the harry allen substation on the npc system 
the utilities own a interest in on line and have entered into a tua with gbt south for its interest in on line 
the utilities interest in on line  which approximates million  will be allocated and to npc and sppc  respectively 
the utilities will have rights to of the capacity of on line  which is estimated to be approximately mw 
if gbt elects to construct phase  it would construct two additional transmission segments at either end of on line one extending from robinson summit north to midpoint  idaho  and the other commencing at the harry allen substation and interconnecting south to the eldorado substation 
gbt would pay for and own of phase facilities 
however  npc and sppc would have rights to additional transmission capacity from midpoint to eldorado for a total of approximately mw based on a rating of  mw for the complete path 
in february  nve announced on line will be delayed by at least three months 
on line was previously expected to be in service by december  the delay is attributed to addressing recent wind related damage sustained by some of the tower structures 
as a result of the damage and as a precautionary measure  the on line owners have directed construction crews to lay down certain existing tower structures and cease erection of further tower structures until the owners have completed an assessment of the situation 
other construction activities that are focused on safety and are unrelated to the wind damage are continuing while the owners work to resolve and repair the wind related damage  ascertain the root causes of the damage  and otherwise determine what project modifications will be necessary to ensure project safety and reliability 
as a result  nve is also delaying the merger application of the utilities 
engage employees to improve processes  reduce costs  and enhance performance the utilities will continue to control operating and maintenance and capital costs through diligent review and process improvement initiatives by providing appropriate tools to our employees to find ways to reduce costs  improve processes  and enhance performance 
this is particularly important at a time when customer growth is low 
going forward this will continue to be an over 
table of contents arching theme of our energy strategy 
our goal is to maintain  reduce  or eliminate upward pressure on our customers prices while always delivering safe and reliable energy and assure compliance with all laws and regulations 
managing regulatory environment the utilities grc s currently provide an opportunity to earn a roe and roe for npc and sppc  respectively 
however  assets not currently included in rate base or that the utilities are not allowed to earn a return affect their ability to achieve their allowed roe 
see note  regulatory actions  for details of regulatory assets not included in rate base or not earning a return 
other items which may not earn a return are certain plant assets completed between filings or for which were not requested in a grc 
the utilities are required to file rate cases every three years to adjust general rates in order to recover their cost of service and return on investment 
the frequency of these filings is designed to more closely align earned returns with those allowed by regulators 
in addition  the utilities are required to file a triennial irp which is a comprehensive plan that considers customer energy requirements and proposes the resources to meet that requirement 
historically  resource additions approved by the pucn in the resource planning process are deemed prudent for ratemaking purposes 
between irp filings  the utilities may seek pucn approval for modifications to their resource plans and for power purchases 
the utilities remain focused on communicating with regulators the necessity of investments to better serve our customers  the prudency of the costs incurred  and the importance of a reasonable return on investment for our shareholders 
in  the utilities will continue to focus on reducing regulatory lag and stabilizing cash flow by filing quarterly applications  as necessary  to reset the bter and deaa rates 
furthermore  the utilities will file annual eeir and eepr base rate and amortization applications in an effort to recover amounts in a timely manner 
goals management cannot predict when economic recovery may occur in nevada  but expects that the nevada economy will continue to struggle for the next several years 
as such  our primary goals will focus on meeting the challenges discussed above by effectively adjusting our business decisions based on economic conditions in nevada  building a sustainable foundation for future requirements by executing our evolution of energy strategy continuing to meet system deployment milestones in order to achieve nv energize project completion by  empower customers through more focused energy efficiency programs  pursue cost effective renewable energy initiatives  continued investment in cost effective energy efficiency and conservation programs  optimizing the use of generation facilities  construction of on line  engage employees to improve processes  reduce costs  enhance performance  and managing our regulatory environment 
critical accounting policies and estimates nve prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
in doing so  certain estimates were made that were critical in nature to the results of operations 
the following discusses those significant estimates that may have a material impact on the financial results of nve and the utilities and are subject to the greatest amount of subjectivity 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of nve s bod 
the items discussed below represent critical accounting estimates that under different conditions or using different assumptions could have a material effect on the financial condition  results of operation  cash flows  liquidity and capital resources of nve and the utilities 
regulatory accounting the utilities retail rates are currently subject to the approval of the pucn and are designed to recover the cost of providing generation  transmission and distribution services 
nve is a holding company under the public utility holding company act of puhca 
as a result  nve and all of its subsidiaries whether or not engaged in any energy related business are required to maintain books  accounts and other records in accordance with ferc regulations and to make them available to the ferc and the pucn 
in addition  the pucn or the ferc have the authority to review allocations of costs of non power goods and administrative services among nve and its subsidiaries 
the ferc has the authority generally to require that rates subject to its jurisdiction be just and reasonable and in this context would continue to be able to  among other things  review transactions between nve  npc and or sppc and or any other affiliated company 
as a result  the utilities qualify for the application of regulatory accounting treatment as allowed by the regulated operations topic of the fasc 
the accounting guidance for regulated operations recognizes that the rate actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset and requires the capitalization of incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense where it is probable that future revenue will be provided to recover these costs 
the accounting guidance prescribes the method to be used to record the financial transactions of a regulated entity 
the criteria for applying the accounting 
table of contents guidance for regulated operations include the following i rates are set by an independent third party regulator  ii approved rates are intended to recover the specific costs of the regulated products or services  and iii rates that are set at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers 
under federal law  wholesale rates charged by the utilities are subject to certain jurisdictional regulation  primarily by the ferc 
the ferc has jurisdiction under the federal power act with respect to rates  service  interconnection  accounting  and other matters in connection with the utilities sale of electricity for resale and interstate transmission 
the ferc also has jurisdiction over the natural gas pipeline companies from which the utilities take service 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because it is probable they will be recovered through future rates collected from customers 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for costs that are not likely to be incurred 
although current rates do not include the recovery of all existing regulatory assets as discussed further below and in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to financial statements  management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery either because we have received prior pucn approval or due to regulatory precedent set for similar circumstances 
management s judgment reflects the current political and regulatory climate in the state  and is subject to change in the future 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the write off of regulatory assets would be required to be recognized as a charge and expensed in current period earnings 
regulatory accounting affects other critical accounting policies  including deferred energy accounting  accounting for pensions  and accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  all of which are discussed immediately below 
deferred energy accounting under deferred energy accounting  to the extent actual fuel and purchased power costs exceed fuel and purchased power costs recoverable through current rates  the excess is not recorded as a current expense on the statement of operations but rather is deferred and recorded as an asset on the balance sheet 
conversely  a liability is recorded to the extent fuel and purchased power costs recoverable through current rates exceed actual fuel and purchased power costs 
these excess amounts are reflected in adjustments to rates and recorded as revenue or expense in future time periods  subject to pucn approval 
nevada law provides that the pucn may not allow the recovery of any costs for purchased fuel or purchased power that were the result of any practice or transaction that was undertaken  managed or performed imprudently by the electric utility 
nevada law specifies that fuel and purchased power costs include all costs incurred to purchase fuel  to purchase capacity  and to purchase energy 
both utilities are entitled under statute to utilize deferred energy accounting for their electric operations and both utilities accumulate amounts in their deferral of energy costs accounts 
the utilities also record a carrying charge  equal to the weighted cost of capital  on such deferred balances  recognized as interest income expense on regulatory items in the current period 
the utilities are exposed to commodity price risk primarily related to changes in the market price of electricity  and the suspension of our hedging program  as well as changes in fuel costs incurred to generate electricity 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for a discussion of the utilities purchased power procurement strategies  and commodity price risk and commodity risk management program 
currently  commodity price increases and decreases are recoverable through the deferred energy accounting mechanism  with no anticipated effect on earnings 
however  the utilities are subject to regulatory risk related to commodity price changes due to the fact that the pucn may disallow recovery for any of these costs that it considers imprudently incurred 
see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements  for additional discussion of the regulatory process to recover these deferred costs 
energy efficiency implementation rate eeir and energy efficiency program rate eepr in  the nevada legislature passed senate bill  which required the pucn to adopt regulations authorizing an electric utility to recover lost revenue that is attributable to the measurable and verifiable effects associated with the implementation of efficiency and conservation programs approved by the pucn 
as a result  the pucn opened docket no 
to amend and adopt the regulation 
the regulation was adopted by the legislature on july  as a result  the utilities file annually in march  to adjust rates and set a clearing rate or eeir effective in october of the same year for over or under collected balance  similar to the deferred energy mechanism discussed above 
in addition  the regulation approved the transition of the recovery for the implementation costs of energy efficiency programs from general rates filed every years to recovery through annual rate filings annually in march  to adjust rates and set a clearing rate or eepr effective in october of the same year for over or under collected balance  similar to the deferred energy mechanism discussed above 
see note  regulatory actions  for details regarding eeir and eepr balances 
although a rate is established for eeir  the actual effects associated with the implementation of energy efficiency and conservation programs is still subject to a measurement and verification process by the pucn 
to the extent the pucn does not approve the measurement and verification amounts  the utilities may not be allowed recovery of such amounts 

table of contents fair value measurements and disclosures nve and the utilities follow the fair value measurements and disclosure topic of the fasc  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 
fair value measurements and disclosure topic of the fasc establishes a three level hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the three levels are defined as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
level primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange traded derivatives and listed equities 
level observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant 
as required by the fair value measurements and disclosure topic of the fasc  financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
nve and the utilities assessment of the significance of a particular input to fair value measurements requires judgment 
the fair value of the utilities assets and liabilities are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis 
the use of different assumptions and variables in determining fair value could significantly impact the valuation and classification within the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  note  investments and other property  note  derivatives and hedging activities  and note  retirement plan and post retirement benefits  in the notes to financial statements for more detailed disclosure of nve s  npc s and sppc s fair value measurements 
accounting for income taxes current and deferred income tax provisions and benefits as well as deferred income tax assets and liabilities involve significant management estimates and judgments 
nve and the utilities file a consolidated federal income tax return 
current income taxes are allocated based on nve and the utilities respective taxable income or loss and tax credits as if each utility filed a separate return 
nve and the utilities recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are also recorded for deductions incurred and credits earned that have not been utilized in tax returns filed or to be filed for tax years through the date of the financial statements 
management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
if it is not more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized in its entirety  a valuation allowance is recorded with respect to the portion estimated not likely to be realized 
management has determined that the federal nol does not require a valuation allowance based on projections of future taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities 
at december   nve had a gross federal nol carryover of approximately billion 
the increase in nve s nol from the prior year is primarily attributable to the bonus depreciation deduction taken in the following table summarizes the nol and tax credit carryovers and associated carryover periods  and valuation allowance for amounts which nve has determined that realization is unlikely as of december  dollars in millions deferred valuation net deferred expiration tax asset allowance tax asset period federal nol research and development credit arizona state coal credits total actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items  including changes in income tax laws  our financial condition and results of operations in future periods  and the review of filed tax returns by taxing 
table of contents authorities 
nve and the utilities income tax returns are regularly audited by applicable tax authorities 
tax benefits associated with income tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  in a tax return are recorded only when the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied and measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
nve and the utilities classify interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits as interest and other expense  respectively  within the income statement 
no interest expense or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded 
as of december   nve and the utilities recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions of approximately million 
the utilities reduce rates to reflect the current tax benefits associated with recognizing certain tax deductions sooner than when the expenses are recognized for financial reporting purposes 
a regulatory asset is recorded for these amounts to reflect the future increases in income taxes payable that will be recovered from customers when these temporary differences reverse 
the utilities have been fully normalized since afudc equity is recorded on an after tax basis 
accordingly  a regulatory asset is recorded when afudc equity is recognized 
this regulatory asset reverses as the related plant is depreciated  resulting in an increase to the tax provision 
the utilities also record regulatory liabilities for obligations to reduce rates charged customers for deferred taxes recovered from customers in prior years at corporate tax rates higher than the current tax rates 
the reduction in rates charged customers will occur as the temporary differences resulting in the excess deferred tax liabilities reverse 
nve and subsidiaries had a net regulatory tax liability of million at december  environmental contingencies nve and its subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and local regulations governing air and water quality  hazardous and solid waste  land use and other environmental considerations 
nevada s utility environmental protection act requires approval of the pucn prior to construction of major utility  generation or transmission facilities 
the epa  ndep and clark county department of air quality and environmental management administer regulations involving air and water quality  solid  and hazardous and toxic waste 
nve and its subsidiaries are subject to rising costs that result from a steady increase in the number of federal  state and local laws and regulations designed to protect the environment 
these laws and regulations can result in increased capital  operating  and other costs as a result of compliance  remediation  containment and monitoring obligations  particularly with laws relating to power plant emissions 
in addition  nve or its subsidiaries may be a responsible party for environmental cleanup at any site identified by a regulatory body 
the management of nve and its subsidiaries cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs and compliance and the possibility that changes will be made to current environmental laws and regulations 
there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 
depending on whether environmental liabilities occurred from normal operations or as part of new environmental laws  the utilities accrue for environmental remediation liabilities in accordance with the accounting guidance required by the asset retirement and environmental obligations topic of the fasc 
estimated costs from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study or when the accounting requirements for environmental obligations have been met 
such costs are adjusted as additional information develops or circumstances change 
certain environmental costs receive regulatory accounting treatment  under which the costs are recorded as regulatory assets 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recognized when their receipt is deemed probable 
environmental expenditures that have future economic benefits are capitalized in accordance with our asset capitalization policy 
note  summary of significant accounting policies  asset retirement obligations  of the notes to financial statements and note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to financial statements  discusses the environmental matters of nve and its subsidiaries that have been identified  and the estimated financial effect of those matters 
to the extent that actual results differ from the estimated financial effects  there are environmental matters not yet identified for which nve or its subsidiaries are determined to be responsible  or the utilities are unable to recover through future rates the costs to remediate such environmental matters  there could be a material adverse effect on the financial condition and future liquidity and results of operations of nve and its subsidiaries 
defined benefit plans and other post retirement plans as further explained in note  retirement plan and post retirement benefits  of the notes to financial statements  nve maintains a qualified pension plan  a non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan serp and restoration plan  as well as a post retirement benefit opeb plan which provides health and life insurance for retired employees 

table of contents pension plans nve s reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits described in note  retirement plan and post retirement benefits  of the notes to financial statements are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions for future experience 
in accordance with the compensation retirement benefits topic of the fasc  changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
as such  significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants 
furthermore  the compensation retirement benefits topic of the fasc requires the immediate recognition of changes in benefit obligations due to differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
however  since nve recovers costs through rates  amounts to be recovered in rates will be recorded as other regulatory assets under the provisions of the regulated operations topic of the fasc  and will be recognized as expense over a period of time 
for the years ended december    and  nve recorded pension expense for all pension plans of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  in accordance with the accounting guidance as defined by the compensation retirement benefits topic of the fasc

pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age and employment periods  the level of contributions nve makes to the plan  and earnings on plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of the plan may also impact current and future pension costs 
pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  the discount rates and demographic mortality  retirement  termination assumptions used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs

results of operations nv energy  inc holding company and other subsidiaries nve holding company the holding company s stand alone operating results included approximately million  million and million of interest costs for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest costs for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is primarily due to early redemption costs incurred in as discussed below and the redemption of nve s senior notes in november the increase in interest costs for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily due to the early redemption of million in the aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  and approximately million in the aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and the issuance of million senior notes  due see note  long term debt  of the notes to financial statements  for further discussion of debt transactions

nv energy  inc consolidated see executive overview  overview of major factors affecting results of operations for nve consolidated 
analysis of cash flows nve s cash flows increased in compared to due to a decrease in cash used by investing and financing  offset partially by a reduction in cash from operating activities 
cash from operating activities 
the decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net income  overall decrease in rates resulting from quarterly bter adjustments and negative deaa rates implemented in october to refund prior period over collected balances to customers  as well as a reduction in revenues from california customers due to the sale of the california assets  as discussed in note  assets held for sale  of the notes to financial statements 
also contributing to this decrease was an increase in coal and other inventory  increased incentive compensation payments for operating results  refund of customer deposits and an increase in conservation programs and solar rebates 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash resulting from npc s deferred rate increase beginning in october and recovery of deferred conservation program costs 
cash used by investing activities 
the decrease in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of california assets by sppc and telecommunication towers by npc  as discussed in note  assets held for sale  of the notes to financial statements 
further contributing to the decrease in cash used by investing activities was federal funding under the american recovery and reinvestment act of  as part of the nv energize project 
cash used by financing activities 
cash used by financing activities decreased due to a reductions in draws on the utilities revolving credit facilities  the redemption of npc s million aggregate principal amount of  series a  general and refunding mortgage notes  which were partially paid by proceeds from the issuance of npc s million  series y  general and refunding mortgage notes and a draw on the credit facility 

table of contents nve s cash flows increased during compared to due to an increase in cash from operating activities and a decrease in cash used by investing activities  offset by a decrease in cash from financing activities 
cash from operating activities 
the increase in cash from operating activities is primarily due to increased revenues as a result of the rate increase in npc s grc and decreased fuel and purchased power costs  offset by bter  weca and deaa rate reductions  a decrease in funding for pension plans  an increase in spending on energy conservation programs  and a refund to a transmission customer in cash used by investing activities 
cash used by investing activities decreased mainly due to the slowdown in construction for infrastructure  and proceeds from the sale of property 
cash used by financing activities 
cash used by financing activities increased primarily due to the redemption of sppc s general and refunding mortgage notes  series h due in an aggregate principal amount of million  a decrease in debt issuance at npc  an increase in payments on npc s revolving credit facility  and higher dividend payments 
liquidity and capital resources nve consolidated overall liquidity nve s consolidated operating cash flows are primarily derived from the operations of npc and sppc 
the primary source of operating cash flows for the utilities is revenues including the recovery of previously deferred energy costs and natural gas costs from sales of electricity and  in the case of sppc  natural gas 
significant uses of cash flows from operations include the purchase of electricity and natural gas  other operating expenses  capital expenditures and interest 
another significant use of cash is the refunding of previously over collected amounts from customers 
see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements for more details of over collected balances 
operating cash flows can be significantly influenced by factors such as weather  regulatory outcomes  and economic conditions 
available liquidity as of december  was as follows in millions available liquidity as of december  nve npc sppc cash and cash equivalents balance available on revolving credit facilities n a less reduction for hedging transactions n a as of february   npc and sppc had no borrowings under their revolving credit facilities 
reduction for hedging transactions reflects balances as of november  npc and sppc are currently unhedged  as discussed further in financial gas hedges 
nve and the utilities attempt to maintain their cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid investments  such as us treasury bills and bank deposits 
in addition to cash on hand  the utilities may use their revolving credit facilities in order to meet their liquidity needs 
alternatively  depending on the usage of their revolving credit facilities  the utilities may issue debt  subject to certain restrictions as discussed in factors affecting liquidity  ability to issue debt  below 
nve will have no debt maturities in or however  npc s debt maturities in include its million general and refunding notes  series i  which mature on april  in addition  npc is required to redeem approximately million of its variable rate debt  due  prior to on line s commercial operation date 
sppc has no debt maturities in however  sppc s million general and refunding notes  series q  will mature on september  nve and the utilities anticipate that they will be able to meet short term operating costs  such as fuel and purchased power costs  with internally generated funds  including the recovery of deferred energy  and the use of their revolving credit facilities 
furthermore  in order to fund long term capital requirements and maturing debt obligations  nve and the utilities will use a combination of internally generated funds  the utilities revolving credit facilities  the issuance of long term debt and or equity and  in the case of the utilities  capital contributions from nve 
however  if energy costs rise at a rapid rate and the utilities do not recover the cost of fuel  purchased power and operating costs in a timely manner or the utilities were to experience a credit rating downgrade resulting in the posting of collateral as discussed below under gas supplier matters and financial gas hedges  the amount of liquidity available to the utilities could be significantly less 
in order to maintain sufficient liquidity  nve and the utilities may be required to delay capital expenditures  re finance debt or issue equity at nve 

table of contents in  the utilities credit ratings on their senior secured debt remained at investment grade see credit ratings below 
in  nve and the utilities did not experience any limitations in the credit markets nor do we expect any in however  disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to nve or the utilities may affect their ability to access funding sources or cause an increase in the interest rates paid on newly issued debt 
as of february   nve has approximately million payable of debt service obligations remaining for  which it intends to pay through dividends from subsidiaries 
see factors affecting liquidity dividends from subsidiaries below 
on february   npc and sppc declared a dividend payable to nve of million and million  respectively 
nve designs operating and capital budgets to control operating costs and capital expenditures 
in addition to operating expenses  nve has continuing commitments for capital expenditures for construction  improvement and maintenance of facilities 
detailed below are nve s capital structure  capital requirements  recently completed financing transactions and factors affecting our ability to obtain debt on favorable terms  including the effect of our holding company structure and limitation on dividends from the utilities 
capital structure nve s actual capital structure on a consolidated basis was as follows at december dollars in thousands percent of total percent of total amount capitalization amount capitalization current maturities of long term debt long term debt shareholder s equity total capital requirements construction expenditures nve s consolidated cash requirements for construction expenditures for are projected to be million

to fund future capital projects  nve and the utilities may meet such financial obligations with a combination of internally generated funds  the use of the utilities revolving credit facilities  the issuance of long term debt  and if necessary  the issuance of equity by nve 
estimated construction expenditures for pucn approved projects  projects under contract  compliance projects and other base capital requirements are as follows dollars in thousands electric facilities generation distribution transmission other total gas facilities distribution other total common facilities total 
table of contents total estimated cash requirements related to construction projects consist of the following dollars in thousands construction expenditures afudc net salvage cost of removal net customer advances and ciac total cash requirements contractual obligations nve consolidated the table below provides nve s contractual obligations on a consolidated basis  as of december   except as otherwise indicated that nve expects to satisfy through a combination of internally generated cash and  as necessary  through the issuance of short term and long term debt 
certain contracts contain variable factors which required nve to estimate the obligation depending on the final variable amount 
actual amounts could differ 
the table does not include estimated construction expenditures described above  except for major capital projects for which the utilities have executed contracts by december   or funding requirements under pension and other post retirement benefit plans  as discussed in note  retirement plan and post retirement benefits  of the notes to financial statements  as of december  additionally  at december   nve has recorded an uncertain tax liability of million in accordance with the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes topic of the fasc all of which is classified as non current

additionally  the utilities  as joint owners  have obligations regarding the construction of on line  of which npc will be responsible for and sppc 
pension and other post retirement benefit plan matters nve has a qualified pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan which cover substantially all employees of nve  npc and sppc 
the annual net benefit cost for the plans is expected to decrease in by approximately million compared to the cost of million 
as of december   the measurement date  the plan was under funded under the provisions of the compensation retirement benefits topic of the fasc 
refer to note  retirement plan and post retirement benefits  of the notes to financial statements 
during  nve funded a total of million to the trusts established for the qualified 
table of contents pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
at the present time  it is not anticipated that additional funding will be required in to meet the minimum funding level requirements defined by the pension protection act of however  nve and the utilities have included in their assumptions funding levels similar to the funding 
the amounts to be contributed in may change subject to market conditions 
financing transactions nve holding company million term loan agreement in october  nve entered into a million year term loan agreement term loan 
the term loan is an unsecured  single draw loan that is due on october  the borrowing under the term loan bears interest at the libor rate plus a margin 
the current libor margin rate is 
the margin varies based upon nve s long term unsecured debt credit rating by s p and moody s 
however  nve entered into a floating for fixed interest rate swap agreement to lock in an effective interest rate of for the length of the term loan 
the term loan contains conditions of borrowing  events of default  and affirmative and negative covenants 
the term loan includes i a financial covenant to maintain a ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated capitalization  determined on the last day of each fiscal quarter  not to exceed to and ii a fixed charge covenant that requires nve not to permit the fixed charge coverage ratio  determined on the last day of each fiscal quarter  to be less than to 
redemption of senior notes in november  nve used the proceeds of the term loan  plus cash on hand  to redeem its unsecured million senior notes senior notes 
the notes were redeemed at of the stated principal amount plus accrued interest to the date of redemption 
with this redemption  nve and the utilities are no longer subject to the restrictive covenants contained in the senior notes  which were more restrictive than the covenants described above for the term loan 
factors affecting liquidity ability to issue debt certain debt of nve holding company places restrictions on debt incurrence and liens  unless  at the time the debt is incurred  the ratio of cash flow to fixed charges for nve s consolidated most recently ended four quarter period on a pro forma basis is at least to  and the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated capitalization does not exceed to 
under these covenant restrictions  as of december   nve consolidated would be allowed to incur up to billion of additional indebtedness 
the amount of additional indebtedness allowed would likely be impacted if there is a change in current market conditions or material change in our financial condition 
npc s and sppc s ability to issue debt sections further discuss their limitations on their ability to issue debt 
effect of holding company structure as of december   nve on a stand alone basis has outstanding debt and other obligations including  but not limited to million term loan due  and million of its unsecured senior notes due due to the holding company structure  nve s right as a common shareholder to receive assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is junior to the claims against the assets of such subsidiary by its creditors 
therefore  nve s debt obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future claims of the creditors of npc and sppc and its other subsidiaries  including trade creditors  debt holders  secured creditors  taxing authorities and guarantee holders 
as of december   nve  npc  sppc and their subsidiaries had approximately billion of debt and other obligations outstanding  consisting of approximately billion of debt at npc  approximately billion of debt at sppc and approximately million of debt at the holding company and other subsidiaries 
although nve and the utilities are parties to agreements that limit the amount of additional indebtedness they may incur  nve and the utilities retain the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness and other liabilities 

table of contents dividends from subsidiaries since nve is a holding company  substantially all of its cash flow is provided by dividends paid to nve by npc and sppc on their common stock  all of which is owned by nve 
since npc and sppc are public utilities  they are subject to regulation by the pucn  which may impose limits on investment returns or otherwise impact the amount of dividends that the utilities may declare and pay 
in addition  certain agreements entered into by the utilities set restrictions on the amount of dividends they may declare and pay and restrict the circumstances under which such dividends may be declared and paid 
as a result of the utilities credit rating on their senior secured debt at investment grade by s p and moody s  these restrictions are suspended and no longer in effect so long as the debt remains investment grade by both rating agencies 
in addition to the restrictions imposed by specific agreements  the federal power act prohibits the payment of dividends from capital accounts 
although the meaning of this provision is unclear  the utilities believe that the federal power act restriction  as applied to their particular circumstances  would not be construed or applied by the ferc to prohibit the payment of dividends for lawful and legitimate business purposes from current year earnings  or in the absence of current year earnings  from other additional paid in capital accounts 
if  however  the ferc were to interpret this provision differently  the ability of the utilities to pay dividends to nve could be jeopardized 
credit ratings the liquidity of nve and the utilities  the cost and availability of borrowing by the utilities under their respective credit facilities  the potential exposure of the utilities to collateral calls under various contracts and the ability of the utilities to acquire fuel and purchased power on favorable terms are all directly affected by the credit ratings for the companies debt 
npc s and sppc s senior secured debt is rated investment grade by three nrsro s fitch  moody s and s p 
as of december   the ratings are as follows rating agency fitch moody s s p nve sr 
unsecured debt bb ba bb npc sr 
secured debt bbb baa bbb sppc sr 
secured debt bbb baa bbb investment grade fitch s lowest level of investment grade credit rating is bbb 
moody s lowest level of investment grade credit rating is baa s p s lowest level of investment grade credit rating is bbb 
fitch s  moody s and s p s rating outlook for nve  npc and sppc is stable 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
security ratings are subject to revision and withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
each security rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings  and  accordingly  each rating should be evaluated in the context of the applicable methodology  independently of all other ratings 
the rating agencies provide ratings at the request of the company being rated and charge the company fees for their services 
energy supplier matters with respect to npc s and sppc s contracts for purchased power  npc and sppc purchase and sell electricity with counterparties under the wspp agreement  an industry standard contract that npc and sppc use as members of the wspp 
the wspp contract is posted on the wspp website 
under these contracts  a material adverse change  which includes a credit rating downgrade of npc and sppc  may allow the counterparty to request adequate financial assurance  which  if not provided within three business days  could cause a default 
most contracts and confirmations for purchased power have been modified or separate agreements have been made to either shorten the normal payment due date or require payment in advance of delivery in response to requests for financial assurance 
a default must be declared within days of the event giving rise to the default becoming known 
a default will result in a termination payment equal to the present value of the net gains and losses for the entire remaining term of all contracts between the parties aggregated to a single liquidated amount due within three business days following the date the notice of termination is received 
the mark to market value  which is substantially based on quoted market prices  can be used to roughly approximate the termination payment and benefit at any point in time 
the net mark to market value as of december  for all suppliers continuing to provide power under a wspp agreement would approximate a million payment or obligation to npc 
no amounts would be due to or from sppc 
these contracts qualify for the normal purchases scope exception under the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasc  and as such  are 
table of contents not required to be marked to market on the balance sheet 
refer to note  derivatives and hedging activities  of the notes to financial statements  for further discussion 
gas supplier matters with respect to the purchase and sale of natural gas  npc and sppc use several types of standard industry contracts 
the natural gas contract terms and conditions are more varied than the electric contracts 
consequently  some of the contracts contain language similar to that found in the wspp agreement and other agreements have unique provisions dealing with material adverse changes  which primarily means a credit rating downgrade below investment grade 
most contracts and confirmations for natural gas purchases have been modified or separate agreements have been made to either shorten the normal payment due date or require payment in advance of delivery in response to requests for financial assurances 
forward physical gas supplies are purchased under index based pricing terms and as such do not carry forward mark to market exposure 
gas transmission service is secured under ferc tariffs or custom agreements 
these service contracts and tariffs require the user to establish and maintain creditworthiness to obtain service or otherwise post cash or a letter of credit to be able to receive service 
service contracts are subject to ferc approved tariffs  which  under certain circumstances  require the utilities to provide collateral to continue receiving service 
npc has a transmission counterparty for which it is required to post cash collateral or a letter of credit in the event of credit rating downgrades 
as of december   the maximum amount of additional collateral npc would be required to post under these contracts in the event of credit rating downgrades was approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million would be required if npc s senior unsecured ratings are rated below bb s p or ba moody s and an additional amount of approximately million would be required if npc s senior secured ratings are downgraded to below investment grade 
financial gas hedges the utilities enter into certain hedging contracts with various counterparties to manage the gas price risk inherent in purchased power and fuel contracts 
as discussed under npc s and sppc s financing transactions  the availability under the utilities revolving credit facilities is reduced for net negative mark to market positions on hedging contracts with counterparties who are lenders under the revolving credit facilities provided that the reduction of availability under the revolving credit facilities shall at no time exceed of the total commitments then in effect under the credit facilities 
as a result of the suspension of the utilities hedging program  there was no negative mark to market exposure for npc and sppc as of november  that would impact credit availability during the month of december beginning in october  the utilities suspended their hedging programs  however  prior to the suspension  it was the general policy of the utilities to purchase hedges three seasons ahead 
as a result certain hedges entered into prior to the suspension in october  did not terminate until as of november  all hedging transactions have expired or terminated and the utilities remain unhedged 
if deemed prudent  the utilities may still purchase hedging instruments in the event circumstances occur that may have the potential to increase the cost of fuel and purchased power 
cross default provisions none of the utilities financing agreements contains a cross default provision that would result in an event of default by that utility upon an event of default by nve or the other utility under any of their respective financing agreements 
certain of nve s financing agreements  however  do contain cross default provisions that would result in an event of default by nve upon an event of default by the utilities under their respective financing agreements 
in addition  certain financing agreements of each of nve and the utilities provide for an event of default if there is a failure under other financing agreements of that entity to meet payment terms or to observe other covenants that would result in an acceleration of payments due 
most of these default provisions other than ones relating to a failure to pay other indebtedness provide for a cure period of days from the occurrence of a specified event  during which time nve or the utilities may rectify or correct the situation before it becomes an event of default 
nevada power company results of operations npc recognized net income of million in compared to net income of million in and million in in  npc paid dividends to nve of approximately million 
in february  npc declared a dividend of approximately million to nve 
details of npc s operating results are further discussed below 
gross margin is presented by npc in order to provide information that management believes aids the reader in determining how profitable the electric business is at the most fundamental level 
gross margin  which is a non gaap financial measure as defined in accordance with sec rules  provides a measure of income available to support the other operating expenses of the business and is a key factor utilized by management in its analysis of its business 

table of contents npc believes presenting gross margin allows the reader to assess the impact of npc s regulatory treatment and its overall regulatory environment on a consistent basis 
gross margin  as a percentage of revenue  is primarily impacted by the fluctuations in electric and natural gas supply costs versus the fixed rates collected from customers 
while these fluctuating costs impact gross margin as a percentage of revenue  they only impact gross margin amounts if the costs cannot be passed through to customers 
gross margin  which npc calculates as operating revenues less energy costs and eepr costs provides a measure of income available to support the other operating expenses of npc 
eepr costs are conservation costs being recovered from ratepayers through eepr revenues which were implemented in july see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements 
costs incurred prior to the implementation of the eepr are recovered through general rates and amortized to other operating expense 
see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements for conservation program amount details 
the eepr mechanism is designed such that conservation costs are equal to revenues collected and any over under collection is deferred as a regulatory asset liability until rates are reset 
as a result  amounts related to eepr do not have an effect on gross margin  operating income or net income 
for reconciliation to operating income  see note  segment information  of the notes to financial statements 
gross margin changes are based primarily on general base rate adjustments which are required by statute to be filed every three years 
the components of gross margin were dollars in thousands change from change from amount prior year amount prior year amount operating revenues energy costs fuel for power generation purchased power deferred energy energy efficiency program costs n a n a gross margin gross margin decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to decreased customer usage as a result of milder weather and conservation programs 
partially offsetting this decrease was the implementation of the eeir rates  which became effective august  as well as a slight increase in customer growth 
gross margin increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to an increase in btgr revenue as a result of npc s grc effective july  partially offsetting the increase in gross margin was a decrease in usage per customer due to conservation programs  economic conditions and hotter than normal weather in may the causes for significant changes in specific lines comprising the results of operations for the years ended are provided below dollars in thousands except for amounts per unit 
table of contents operating revenues change from change from amount prior year amount prior year amount operating revenues residential commercial industrial retail revenues other total operating revenues retail sales in thousands of mwhs average retail revenue per mwh npc s retail revenues decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to decreased energy rates from npc s various bter quarterly updates  the annual deferred energy cases effective october  and october  and the expiration of the western energy crisis amortization rate on may  see note  regulatory actions of the notes to the financial statements 
residential retail revenues decreased further due to decreases in customer usage resulting from milder temperatures during the summer months of and conservation programs 
these decreases were partially offset by eepr revenue  effective july  see note  regulatory actions of the notes to the financial statements 
average residential and commercial customers increased by and  respectively  while average industrial customers decreased by npc s retail revenues decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to decreased energy rates from npc s various bter quarterly updates  the annual deferred energy case effective october  and the expiration of the western energy crisis amortization rate on may  see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to the financial statements 
also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in customer usage due to conservation programs  economic conditions and hotter than normal weather in may these decreases were partially offset by increases in general rates as a result of npc s grc  effective july  see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to the financial statements 
average residential  commercial  and industrial customers increased by  and  respectively 
other operating revenues decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to decreased revenue from public street and highway lighting  resulting from lower energy rates 
other operating revenues decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in the decrease is primarily due to the expiration of a significant transmission agreement with calpine energy services and decreases in sales for resale 
energy costs energy costs include fuel for generation and purchased power 
energy costs are dependent upon several factors which may vary by season or period 
as a result  npc s usage and average cost per mwh of fuel for generation versus purchased power to meet demand can vary significantly 
factors that may affect energy costs include  but are not limited to weather  generation efficiency  plant outages  total system demand  resource constraints  transmission constraints  natural gas constraints  long term contracts  and mandated power purchases

volume was relatively flat year over year 
the average cost per mwh of energy decreased primarily due to decreased hedging costs and lower natural gas prices 
fuel for power generation costs decreased for the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in hedging costs as well as lower natural gas prices and a decrease in volume due to planned outages 
in may  the expansion at the harry allen generation station became commercially operable 
purchased power costs decreased for the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in hedging costs related to tolling contracts as well as a decrease in market prices 
volume for the year ended december  increased primarily due to planned outages within the generation fleet early in the year and due to mandated power purchases 
energy costs decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with hedging activities offset by a slight increase in natural gas prices 
in  self generation  which is primarily gas fired generating units  satisfied of npc s system load 
fuel for generation costs increased for the year ended december   primarily due to higher cost of natural gas and the change in the method of allocating electric tolling option expense between fuel for generation and purchased power which had no impact on gross margin or operating income  partially offset by a decrease in volume and a decrease in costs associated with hedging activities 
mwhs generated decreased for the year ended december   primarily due to planned outages within internal generation in the early part of the year 
the average price per mwh of generated power increased for the year due to an increase in natural gas costs and the change in method of allocating electric tolling option expense  partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with hedging activities 
purchased power costs and the average cost per mwh of purchased power decreased for the year ending december   primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with hedging activities and the change in method of allocating electric tolling option expense  as discussed above  partially offset by an increase in renewable energy purchases and capacity contracts 
purchased power mwhs increased for the year ending december   due to renewable energy purchases and plant outages within internal generation 
deferred energy change from change from amount prior year amount prior year amount deferred energy 
table of contents deferred energy represents the difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred during the period and amounts recoverable through current rates 
to the extent actual costs exceed amounts recoverable through current rates  the excess is recognized as a reduction in costs 
conversely  to the extent actual costs are less than amounts recoverable through current rates  the difference is recognized as an increase in costs 
deferred energy also includes the current amortization of fuel and purchased power costs previously deferred 
refer to note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements for further detail of deferred energy balances 
amounts for  and include amortization of deferred energy of million  million and million  respectively  and an over collection of amounts recoverable in rates of million  million and million  respectively 
other operating expenses change from change from amount prior year amount prior year amount energy efficiency program costs n a n a other operating expenses maintenance depreciation and amortization energy efficiency program costs are conservation costs being recovered from ratepayers through eepr revenues which were implemented in july see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements 
costs incurred prior to the implementation of the eepr are recovered through general rates and amortized to other operating expense discussed below 
the eepr mechanism is designed such that conservation costs expense are equal to revenues collected and any over under collection is deferred as a regulatory asset liability  until rates are reset 
as a result  amounts related to eepr do not have an effect on gross margin  operating income or net income 
other operating expense decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to a decrease in consulting fees  overall lower generating expense  lower employee pension and benefit costs and higher capitalization of administrative and general costs for the harry allen generating station 
the decrease in other operating expense was partially offset by an increase in stock compensation costs 
other operating expense decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to lower employee pension and benefit expenses  costs incurred in related to severance programs  as discussed further in note  severance programs  of the notes to financial statements and a reduction in bad debt expense 
in addition  other operating expenses decreased as a result of costs associated with the repr 
beginning in  these amounts are reported net of their related operating expense  as such  repr amounts no longer affect operating expense 
in  repr costs were not material and were included in operating expenses with a corresponding amount recorded to revenues and had no effect on net income 
the decrease was partially offset by increases in amortization of dsm programs and higher operating leases 
maintenance expense decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to the accrual in for estimated payments for the termination of the long term service agreement for the higgins generating station  which was reversed in the third quarter of upon final calculation of the termination amount 
also contributing to the decrease in maintenance expense was planned maintenance outages that occurred in at the higgins  lenzie and silverhawk generating stations 
this decrease was partially offset by planned maintenance outages that occurred in at the reid gardner and harry allen generating stations 
maintenance expense increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to termination of a long term service agreement and maintenance at the higgins  harry allen and silverhawk generating stations 
this increase was partially offset by planned maintenance outages that occurred in at the reid gardner and clark generating stations 
depreciation and amortization increased for the year ended december   compared to  primarily due to general increases in plant in service  including the harry allen generating station and ewam projects

further contributing to the increase was interest expense due to the issuance of million  series x  general and refunding mortgage notes in september and the issuance of million  series y  general and refunding mortgage notes in may partially offset by a decrease in interest expense resulting from the redemption of million general and refunding mortgage notes  series a  in june  partial redemptions of series a  b  c  and d in october and lower credit facility balances in interest expense decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to the expiration in of amortization costs related to debt issues and redemptions  an increase to afudc due to construction at the harry allen generating station  lower interest on variable rate debt and the partial redemption of series a in december and the redemptions of series a  b  c  and d in october partially offsetting this decrease was higher credit facility balances in  and increased interest expense due to the issuance of million  series v  general and refunding mortgage notes in march and the issuance of million  series x  general and refunding mortgage notes in september see note  long term debt  for further discussion 
other income expense change from change from amount prior year amount prior year amount interest income expense on regulatory items afudc equity other income other expense the increase in interest expense on regulatory items for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  is primarily due to higher over collected deferred energy balances during when compared to deferred energy balances during also contributing to the increase in interest expense on regulatory items was a decrease in interest income as a result of lower deferred rate balances in see note  regulatory actions  for further details of deferred energy balances and discussion of the deferred rate increase under npc s grc 
the change in interest income expense on regulatory items for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  is primarily due to over collected deferred energy balances

this decrease is partially offset by higher interest income related to an income tax refund and investments in 
table of contents other expense increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to adjustment in resulting from npc s grc in  the disallowance for eeir in  higher donations in  and higher losses on investments in other expense decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to charges in resulting from npc s grc in  a disallowance related to contract pricing for energy in  partially offset by adjustments for the settlement of the deferred energy rate case in analysis of cash flows npc s cash flows decreased during in compared to due to a decrease in cash from operating and financing activities  offset partially by a reduction in cash used by investing activities 
cash from operating activities 
the decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net income  an overall decrease in rates resulting from quarterly bter adjustments and negative deaa rates implemented in october to refund prior period over collected balances to customers  increased incentive compensation payments for the operating results  an increase in coal and other inventory  refunds of customer deposits and an increase in conservation programs and solar rebates 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash resulting from npc s deferred rate increase beginning in october  the recovery of deferred conservation program costs and lower funding for pension plans 
cash used by investing activities 
the decrease in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of certain telecommunication towers as discussed in note  assets held for sale  and federal funding under the american recovery and reinvestment act of  as a part of the nv energize project 
cash used by financing activities 
cash used by financing activities decreased primarily due to a reduction in draws on npc s revolving credit facility  the redemption of npc s million aggregate principal amount of  series a  general and refunding mortgage notes  which were partially paid by proceeds from the issuance of npc s million  series y  general and refunding mortgage notes 
also contributing to the decrease was the payment of dividends to nve and a settlement payment for the interest rate swap agreement as discussed in note  long term debt  of the notes to financial statements 
the decrease was partially offset by a capital contribution from nve 
npc s cash flows increased during compared to due to an increase in cash from operating activities and a reduction in cash used for investing activities  partially offset by a decrease in cash from financing activities 
cash from operating activities 
the increase in cash from operating activities is primarily due to increased revenues as a result of the rate increase in npc s grc  decreased purchased power costs  a decrease in funding for pension plans  and a refund to a transmission customer in  partially offset by bter  weca and deaa rate reductions 
cash used by investing activities 
cash used by investing activities decreased mainly due to the slowdown in construction for infrastructure  and proceeds from the sale of property 
cash used by financing activities 
cash used by financing activities increased primarily due to a reduction in the issuance of debt compared to and an increase in payments on npc s revolving credit facility  partially offset by lower dividend payments to nve 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overall liquidity npc s primary source of operating cash flows is electric revenues  including the recovery of previously deferred energy costs 
significant uses of cash flows from operations include the purchase of electricity and natural gas  other operating expenses  capital expenditures and the payment of interest on npc s outstanding indebtedness 
another significant use of cash is the refunding of previously over collected amounts from customers 
see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements for more details of over collected balances 
operating cash flows can be significantly influenced by factors such as weather  regulatory outcome  and economic conditions 
available liquidity as of december  was as follows in millions available liquidity as of december  npc cash and cash equivalents balance available on revolving credit facility less reduction for hedging transactions as of february   npc had no borrowings under its revolving credit facility  not including letters of credits 
reduction for hedging transactions reflects balances as of november  npc is currently unhedged  as discussed further in financial gas hedges 
npc attempts to maintain its cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid investments  such as us treasury bills and bank deposits 
in addition to cash on hand  npc may use its revolving credit facility in order to meet its liquidity needs 
alternatively  depending on the usage of the revolving credit facility  npc may issue debt  subject to certain restrictions as discussed in factors affecting liquidity  ability to issue debt  below 
npc s debt maturities in include its million general and refunding mortgage notes  series i  which mature april  in addition  npc is required to redeem approximately million of its variable rate debt  due  prior to on line s commercial operation date 
as of february   npc has no borrowings on its revolving credit facility  not including letters of credit 
npc anticipates that it will be able to meet short term operating costs  such as fuel and purchased power costs  with internally generated funds  including recovery of deferred energy  and the use of its revolving credit facility 
furthermore  in order to fund long term capital requirements and maturing debt obligations  npc will use a combination of internally generated funds  its revolving credit facility  the issuance of long term debt and or capital contributions from nve 
however  if energy costs rise at a rapid rate and npc does not recover the cost of fuel and purchased power in a timely manner  if operating costs are not recovered in a timely manner or npc were to experience a credit rating downgrade resulting in the posting of collateral as discussed below under gas supplier matters and financial gas hedges  the amount of liquidity available to npc could be significantly less 
in order to maintain sufficient liquidity  npc may be required to further delay capital expenditures  refinance debt or obtain funding through an equity issuance by nve 
the ability to issue debt  as discussed later  is subject to certain covenant calculations which include consolidated net income of nve and the utilities 
as a result of these covenant calculations and the seasonality of the utilities business  the ability to issue debt can vary from quarter to quarter  and the utilities may not be able to fully utilize the availability on their revolving credit facilities 
in  npc s credit ratings on its senior secured debt remained at investment grade see credit ratings below 
in  npc did not experience any limitations in the credit markets  nor does npc expect any significant limitations in however  disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to npc may affect its ability to access funding sources or cause an increase in the interest rates paid on newly issued debt 
in  npc paid dividends to nve of million 
on february   npc declared a dividend payable to nve of million 
npc designs operating and capital budgets to control operating costs and capital expenditures 
in addition to operating expenses  npc has continuing commitments for capital expenditures for construction  improvement and maintenance of facilities 
detailed below are npc s capital structure  capital requirements  recently completed financing transactions and factors affecting liquidity  including our ability to obtain debt on favorable terms 

table of contents capital structure npc s actual consolidated capital structure was as follows at december dollars in thousands percent of total percent of total amount capitalization amount capitalization current maturities of long term debt long term debt shareholder s equity total capital requirements construction expenditures npc s cash requirement for construction expenditures for is projected to be million 
npc s cash requirements for construction expenditures for through are projected to be billion 
gross construction expenditures  including afudc debt  net salvage and ciac for the years ended   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
net cash requirements to fund construction for the years ended  and were million  million and million  respectively 
to fund future capital projects npc may meet such financial obligations with a combination of internally generated funds  the use of its revolving credit facilities  the issuance of long term debt  and if necessary  capital contributions from nve 
contractual obligations the table below provides npc s consolidated contractual obligations  as of december   that npc expects to satisfy through a combination of internally generated cash and  as necessary  through the issuance of short term and long term debt 
certain contracts contain variable factors which required npc to estimate the obligation depending on the final variable amount 
actual amounts could differ 
the table does not include estimated construction expenditures described above  except for major capital projects for which npc has executed contracts by december  additionally  at december   npc has recorded an uncertain tax liability of million as required by the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes topic of the fasc  all of which is classified as non current 
npc is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash payments to relevant tax authorities  consequently  none of the uncertain tax liability is included in the contractual obligations table below dollars in millions payment due by period thereafter total long term debt maturities long term debt interest payments purchased power purchased power not commercially operable coal natural gas transportation long term service agreements capital projects operating leases capital leases total contractual cash obligations represents estimated payments under renewable energy power purchase contracts  which have been approved by the pucn and are contingent upon the developers obtaining commercial operation and their ability to deliver energy 
includes the tua with gbt which is contingent upon final construction costs and reaching commercial operation 
amounts based on estimated usage 
capital projects include nv energize and npc s requirement to purchase the undepreciated cost of capital of reid gardner generating station unit no

additionally  npc  as a joint owner  has obligations regarding the construction of on line 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefit plan matters nve has a qualified pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan which cover substantially all employees of nve  npc and sppc 
the annual net benefit cost for the plans is expected to decrease in by approximately million compared to the cost of million 
as of december   the measurement date  the plan was under funded under the provisions of the compensation retirement benefits topic of the fasc 
refer to note  retirement plan and post retirement benefits  of the notes to the financial statements 
during  nve funded a total of million to the trusts established for the qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
at the present time  it is not anticipated that additional funding will be required in to meet the minimum funding level requirements defined by the pension protection act of however  nve and the utilities have included in their assumptions funding levels similar to the funding 
the amounts to be contributed in may change subject to market conditions 
financing transactions general and refunding mortgage notes  series y in may  npc issued and sold million of its general and refunding mortgage notes  series y  due may  the approximately million in net proceeds  plus a portion of the proceeds from a draw on npc s revolving credit facility  were utilized to pay at maturity npc s million aggregate principal amount of general and refunding mortgage notes  series a  which matured on june  in conjunction with this debt issuance  npc entered into an interest rate swap hedging agreement with a notional principal amount of million and a mandatory termination date of june  the interest rate swap agreement was entered into to effectively lock the interest rate of the us treasury component of the prospective general and refunding note issuance 
the swap transaction was settled on may   when npc launched and priced the series y notes  resulting in a settlement payment amount of million  which was recorded as a cost to issue in a deferred debit and will be amortized over the year life of the series y notes in accordance with past accounting precedent for our regulated utilities 
million revolving credit facility npc s million revolving credit facility contains a provision which reduces the availability under the credit facility by the negative mark to market exposure for hedging transactions with credit facility lenders or their energy trading affiliates 
the reduction in availability limits the amount that npc can borrow or use for letters of credit and would require that npc prepay any amount in excess of that limitation 
the amount of the reduction is calculated by npc on a monthly basis  and after calculating such reduction  the npc credit agreement provides that the reduction in availability under the revolving credit facility to npc shall not exceed of the total commitments then in effect under the revolving credit facility 
the npc credit agreement contains one financial maintenance covenant that requires npc to maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capital  determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  not to exceed to in the event that npc did not meet the financial maintenance covenant or there is an event of default  the npc credit agreement would restrict dividends to nve 
moreover  so long as npc s senior secured debt remains rated investment grade by s p and moody s in each case  with a stable or better outlook  a representation concerning no material adverse change in npc s business  assets  property or financial condition would not be a condition to the availability of credit under the facility 
in the event that npc s senior secured debt rating were rated below investment grade by either s p or moody s  or investment grade by either s p or moody s but with a negative outlook  a representation concerning no material adverse change in npc s business  assets  property or financial condition would be a condition to borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
npc s current revolving credit facility expires in april  however  management is currently renegotiating the terms and expects to close in early factors affecting liquidity ability to issue debt npc s ability to issue debt is impacted by certain factors such as financing authority from the pucn  financial covenants in its financing agreements and revolving credit facility agreements  and the terms of certain nve debt 
as of december   the most restrictive of the factors below is the pucn authority 
as such  npc may issue up to million in long term debt  in addition to the use of its existing credit facility 
however  depending on nve s or sppc s issuance of long term debt or the use of the utilities revolving credit facilities  the pucn authority may not remain the most restrictive factor 
the factors affecting npc s ability to issue debt are further detailed below a 
financing authority from the pucn as of december   npc has financing authority from the pucn for the period ending december   consisting of authority to issue additional long term debt securities of up to 
table of contents million  to refinance up to approximately million of long term debt securities  and ongoing authority to maintain a revolving credit facility of up to billion 
b 
financial covenants within npc s financing agreements under its million revolving credit facility  npc must maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capital  determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  not to exceed to based on december  financial statements  npc was in compliance with this covenant and could incur up to billion of additional indebtedness 
all other financial covenants contained in npc s financing agreements are suspended  as npc s senior secured debt is rated investment grade 
however  if npc s senior secured debt ratings fall below investment grade by either moody s or s p  npc would again be subject to the limitations under these additional covenants  and c 
financial covenants contained within nve s term loan as discussed in nve s ability to issue debt  npc is also subject to nve s cap on additional consolidated indebtedness of billion 
ability to issue general and refunding mortgage securities to the extent that npc has the ability to issue debt under the most restrictive covenants in its financing agreements and has financing authority to do so from the pucn  npc s ability to issue secured debt is still limited by the amount of bondable property or retired bonds that can be used to issue debt under npc s general and refunding mortgage indenture indenture 
the indenture creates a lien on substantially all of npc s properties in nevada 
as of december   billion of npc s general and refunding mortgage securities were outstanding 
npc had the capacity to issue billion of general and refunding mortgage securities as of december  that amount is determined on the basis of of net utility property additions  and or the principal amount of retired general and refunding mortgage securities 
property additions include plant in service and specific assets in cwip 
the amount of bond capacity listed above does not include eligible property in cwip 
npc also has the ability to release property from the lien of the mortgage indenture on the basis of net property additions  cash and or retired bonds 
to the extent npc releases property from the lien of npc s indenture  it will reduce the amount of securities issuable under the indenture 
credit ratings the liquidity of npc  the cost and availability of borrowing by npc under its credit facility  the potential exposure of npc to collateral calls under various contracts and the ability of npc to acquire fuel and purchased power on favorable terms are all directly affected by the credit ratings for npc s debt 
npc s senior secured debt is rated investment grade by three nrsro s fitch  moody s and s p 
in may  moody s upgraded npc s senior secured debt to baa as of december   the ratings are as follows rating agency fitch moody s s p npc sr 
secured debt bbb baa bbb investment grade fitch s lowest level of investment grade credit rating is bbb 
moody s lowest level of investment grade credit rating is baa s p s lowest level of investment grade credit rating is bbb 
fitch s  moody s and s p s rating outlook for npc is stable 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
security ratings are subject to revision and withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
each security rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings  and accordingly  each rating should be evaluated in the context of the applicable methodology  independently of all other ratings 
the rating agencies provide ratings at the request of the company being rated and charge the company fees for their services 

table of contents energy supplier matters with respect to npc s contracts for purchased power  npc purchases and sells electricity with counterparties under the wspp agreement  an industry standard contract that npc uses as a member of the wspp 
the wspp contract is posted on the wspp website 
under these contracts  a material adverse change  which includes a credit rating downgrade  in npc may allow the counterparty to request adequate financial assurance  which  if not provided within three business days  could cause a default 
most contracts and confirmations for purchased power have been modified or separate agreements have been made to either shorten the normal payment due date or require payment in advance of delivery in response to requests for financial assurance 
a default must be declared within days of the event giving rise to the default becoming known 
a default will result in a termination payment equal to the present value of the net gains and losses for the entire remaining term of all contracts between the parties aggregated to a single liquidated amount due within three business days following the date the notice of termination is received 
the mark to market value  which is substantially based on quoted market prices  can be used to roughly approximate the termination payment and benefit at any point in time 
the net mark to market value as of december  for all suppliers continuing to provide power under a wspp agreement would approximate a million payment or obligation to npc 
these contracts qualify for the normal purchases scope exception under the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasc  and as such  are not required to be marked to market on the balance sheet 
refer to note  derivatives and hedging activities  of the notes to financial statements  for further discussion 
gas supplier matters with respect to the purchase and sale of natural gas  npc uses several types of standard industry contracts 
the natural gas contract terms and conditions are more varied than the electric contracts 
consequently  some of the contracts contain language similar to that found in the wspp agreement and other agreements have unique provisions dealing with material adverse changes  which primarily means a credit rating downgrade below investment grade 
most contracts and confirmations for natural gas purchases have been modified or separate agreements have been made to either shorten the normal payment due date or require payment in advance of delivery in response to requests for financial assurances 
forward physical gas supplies are purchased under index based pricing terms and as such do not carry forward mark to market exposure 
gas transmission service is secured under ferc tariffs or custom agreements 
these service contracts and tariffs require the user to establish and maintain creditworthiness to obtain service or otherwise post cash or a letter of credit to be able to receive service 
service contracts are subject to ferc approved tariffs  which  under certain circumstances  require the utilities to provide collateral to continue receiving service 
npc has a transmission counterparty for which it is required to post cash collateral or a letter of credit in the event of credit rating downgrades 
as of december   the maximum amount of additional collateral npc would be required to post under these contracts in the event of credit rating downgrades was approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million would be required if npc s senior unsecured ratings are rated below bb s p or ba moody s and an additional amount of approximately million would be required if npc s senior secured ratings are downgraded to below investment grade 
financial gas hedges npc enters into certain hedging contracts with various counterparties to manage the gas price risk inherent in purchased power and fuel contracts 
as discussed under npc s financing transactions  the availability under npc s revolving credit facility is reduced by the amount of net negative mark to market positions on hedging contracts with counterparties who are lenders to the revolving credit facility  provided that the reduction in availability under the revolving credit facility shall at no time exceed of the total commitments then in effect under the revolving credit facility 
as a result of the suspension of the suspension of the utilities hedging program  there was no negative mark to market exposure for npc as of november  that would impact credit availability during the month of december beginning in october  the utilities suspended their hedging programs  however  prior to the suspension  it was the general policy of the utilities to purchase hedges three seasons ahead 
as a result certain hedges entered into prior to the suspension in october  did not terminate until as of november  all hedging transactions have expired or terminated and the utilities remain unhedged 
if deemed prudent  the utilities may still purchase hedging instruments in the event circumstances occur that may have the potential to increase the cost of fuel and purchased power 
cross default provisions none of the financing agreements of npc contains a cross default provision that would result in an event of default by npc upon an event of default by nve or sppc under any of its financing agreements 
in addition  certain financing agreements of npc provide for an event of default if there is a failure under other financing agreements of npc to meet payment terms or to observe other covenants that would result in an acceleration of payments due 
most of these default provisions other than ones relating to a failure to pay such other indebtedness when due provide for a cure period of days from the occurrence of a specified event during which time npc may rectify or correct the situation before it becomes an event of default 

table of contents sierra pacific power company results of operations sppc recognized net income of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million in and a net income of million in in  sppc paid dividends to nve of approximately million 
in february  sppc declared a dividend of approximately million to nve 
details of sppc s operating results are further discussed below 
gross margin is presented by sppc in order to provide information that management believes aids the reader in determining how profitable the electric business is at the most fundamental level 
gross margin  which is a non gaap financial measure as defined in accordance with sec rules  provides a measure of income available to support the other operating expenses of the business and is a key factor utilized by management in its analysis of its business 
sppc believes presenting gross margin allows the reader to assess the impact of sppc s regulatory treatment and its overall regulatory environment on a consistent basis 
gross margin  as a percentage of revenue  is primarily impacted by the fluctuations in regulated electric and natural gas supply costs versus the fixed rates collected from customers 
while these fluctuating costs impact gross margin as a percentage of revenue  they only impact gross margin amounts if the costs cannot be passed through to customers 
gross margin  which sppc calculates as operating revenues less energy costs and eepr costs  provides a measure of income available to support the other operating expenses of sppc 
eepr costs are conservation costs being recovered from ratepayers through eepr revenues which were implemented in july see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements 
costs incurred prior to the implementation of the eepr are recovered through general rates and amortized to other operating expense 
see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements for conservation program amount details 
the eepr mechanism is designed such that conservation costs are equal to revenues collected and any over under collection is deferred as a regulatory asset liability until rates are reset 
as a result  amounts related to eepr do not have an effect on gross margin  operating income or net income 
for reconciliation to operating income  see note  segment information  in the notes to financial statements 
gross margin changes are based primarily on general base rate adjustments which are required to be filed by statute every three years

energy costs energy costs include fuel for generation and purchased power 
these costs are dependent upon many factors which may vary by season or period 
as a result  sppc s usage and average cost per mwh of fuel for generation versus purchased power can vary significantly as the company meets the demands of the season 
these factors include  but are not limited to weather  plant outages  total system demand  resource constraints  transmission constraints  gas transportation constraints  natural gas constraints  mandated power purchases  and generation efficiency

total system demand for the year ended december  increased for the same period due to colder winter temperatures 
fuel for generation costs decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in due to a decrease in hedging costs along with a decrease in internal generation 
the decrease in system output was primarily caused by planned maintenance at tracy generating station and planned outages at the valmy generating station 
purchased power costs and volume increased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily due to the maintenance and outages discussed above and due to the availability of hydro power purchases early in the year which were more economical 
the average cost per mwh decreased due to lower market prices 
energy costs and the average cost per mwh decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to decreased costs associated with hedging activities partially offset by the higher natural gas costs

deferred energy change from change from amount prior year amount prior year amount deferral of energy electric net deferral of energy gas net total deferred energy represents the difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred during the period and amounts recoverable through current rates 
to the extent actual costs exceed amounts recoverable through current rates  the excess is recognized as a reduction in costs

costs incurred prior to the implementation of the eepr are recovered through general rates amortized to other operating expense discussed below 
the eepr mechanism is designed such that conservation costs expense are equal to revenues collected and any over under collection is deferred as a regulatory asset liability  until rates are reset 
as a result  amounts related to eepr do not have an effect on gross margin  operating income or net income 
other operating expense decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to lower outside consulting fees  a reduction in customer expense  rate case expenses  and lease expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in stock compensation costs and regulatory amortizations primarily for conservation programs 
other operating expense decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to lower employee pension and benefit expenses  costs incurred in related to severance programs  as discussed further in note  severance programs  of the notes to financial statements and a reduction in bad debt expense  partially offset by increases in regulatory expenses 
in addition  other operating expenses decreased as a result of costs associated with the repr

partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in lease expense and charitable donations 
other expense increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  due to an increase in donations related to independence lake and adjustments resulting from sppc s electric grc 
partially offsetting the increase was a disallowance in relating to contract pricing for energy 
analysis of cash flows sppc s cash flows increased in compared to due to a decrease in cash used by investing and financing activities  offset partially by a decrease in cash from operating activities 
cash from operating activities 
the decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net income  an overall decrease in rates resulting from quarterly bter adjustments and negative deaa rates implemented in october to refund prior period over collected balances to customers 
also contributing to the decrease is the reduction in revenues from california customers due to the sale of the california assets  as discussed in note  assets held for sale  of the notes to financial statements  an increase in coal inventory for the valmy generating station  an increase in conservation and renewable energy program costs  increased funding of pension plans and increased incentive compensation payments for the operating results 
these decreases were partially offset by the recovery of deferred conservation program costs as a result of sppc s grc 

table of contents cash used by investing activities 
cash used by investing activities decreased due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of california assets  as discussed in note  assets held for sale  of the notes to financial statements and federal funding under the american recovery and reinvestment act of  as part of the nv energize project 
cash used by financing activities 
the decrease in cash used by financing activities is primarily due to a reduction in retirement of long term debt  offset partially by higher dividends to nve 
sppc s cash flows increased during compared to due to a reduction in cash used by investing activities offset by a decrease in cash from operating activities and a decrease in cash from financing activities 
cash from operating activities 
the decrease in cash from operating activities is primarily due to a reduction in bter and deaa rates charged to customers  and an increase in spending on energy conservation programs 
the decrease in cash was partially offset by decreased spending on fuel for purchased power costs and a decrease in funding for pension plans compared to cash used by investing activities 
cash used by investing activities decreased mainly due to the slowdown in construction for infrastructure  and proceeds from the sale of property 
cash used by financing activities 
cash used by financing activities increased primarily due to the redemption of sppc s general and refunding mortgage notes  series h due in an aggregate principal amount of million and a decrease in capital contributions from nve 
this decrease was partially offset by lower dividend payments to nve 
liquidity and capital resources overall liquidity sppc s primary source of operating cash flows is electric and natural gas revenues  including the recovery of previously deferred energy costs 
significant uses of cash flows from operations include the purchase of electricity and natural gas  other operating expenses  capital expenditures and the payment of interest on sppc s outstanding indebtedness 
another significant use of cash is the refunding of previously over collected amounts from customers 
see note  regulatory actions  of the notes to financial statements for more details of over collected balances 
operating cash flows can be significantly influenced by factors such as weather  regulatory outcome and economic conditions 
available liquidity as of december  was as follows in millions available liquidity as of december  sppc cash and cash equivalents balance available on revolving credit facility less reduction for hedging transactions as of february   sppc had no borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
reduction for hedging transactions reflects balances as of november  sppc is currently unhedged  as discussed further in financial gas hedges 
sppc attempts to maintain its cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid investments  such as us treasury bills and bank deposits 
in addition to cash on hand  sppc may use its revolving credit facility in order to meet its liquidity needs 
alternatively  depending on the usage of the revolving credit facility  sppc may issue debt  subject to certain restrictions as discussed in factors affecting liquidity  ability to issue debt  below 
sppc has no debt maturities in however  sppc s million general and refunding notes  series q  will mature on september  as of february   sppc has no borrowings on its revolving credit facility  not including letters of credit 
sppc anticipates that it will be able to meet short term operating costs  such as fuel and purchased power costs  with internally generated funds  including the recovery of deferred energy and the use of its revolving credit facility 
furthermore  in order to fund long term capital requirements and maturing debt obligations  sppc will use a combination of internally generated funds  its revolving credit facility  the issuance of long term debt and or capital contributions from nve 
however  if energy costs rise at a rapid rate and sppc does not recover the cost of fuel and purchased power in a timely manner  if operating costs are not recovered in a timely manner or sppc were to experience a credit rating downgrade resulting in the posting of collateral as discussed below under gas supplier matters and financial gas hedges  the amount of liquidity available to sppc could be significantly less 
in order to 
table of contents maintain sufficient liquidity  sppc may be required to further delay capital expenditures  refinance debt or obtain funding through an equity issuance by nve 
the ability to issue debt  as discussed later  is subject to certain covenant calculations which include consolidated net income of nve and the utilities 
as a result of these covenant calculations and the seasonality of the utilities business  the ability to issue debt can vary from quarter to quarter  and the utilities may not be able to fully utilize the availability on their revolving credit facilities 
in  sppc s credit ratings on its senior secured debt remained at investment grade see credit ratings below 
in  sppc did not experience any limitations in the credit markets  nor do we expect any significant limitations in however  disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to sppc may affect its ability to access funding sources or cause an increase in the interest rates paid on newly issued debt 
in  sppc paid dividends to nve of million 
on february   sppc declared a million dividend payable to nve 
sppc designs operating and capital budgets to control operating costs and capital expenditures 
in addition to operating expenses  sppc has continuing commitments for capital expenditures for construction  improvement and maintenance of facilities 
detailed below are sppc s capital structure  capital requirements  recently completed financing transactions and factors affecting liquidity  including its ability to obtain debt on favorable terms 
capital structure sppc s actual consolidated capital structure was as follows at december dollars in thousands amount percent of total capitalization amount percent of total capitalization long term debt shareholder s equity total capital requirements construction expenditures sppc s cash requirement for construction expenditures for is projected to be million 
sppc s cash requirement for construction expenditures for through is projected to be million 
gross construction expenditures  including afudc debt  net salvage and ciac for the years ended   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
net cash requirements to fund construction for the years ended  and were million  million and million  respectively 
to fund future capital projects sppc may meet such financial obligations with a combination of internally generated funds  the use of its revolving credit facility and if necessary  the issuance of long term debt and or capital contributions from nve 
contractual obligations the table below provides sppc s consolidated contractual obligations  as of december   that sppc expects to satisfy through a combination of internally generated cash and  as necessary  through the issuance of short term and long term debt 
certain contracts contain variable factors which required sppc to estimate the obligation depending on the final variable amount 
actual amounts could differ 
the table does not include estimated construction expenditures described above  except for major capital projects for which sppc has executed contracts by december  additionally  at december   sppc recorded an uncertain tax liability of million as required by the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes topic of the fasc  all of which is classified as non current 
sppc is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash payments to relevant tax authorities  consequently  none of the uncertain tax liability is included in the contractual obligations table below dollars in millions 
table of contents payment due by period thereafter total long term debt maturities long term debt interest payments purchased power coal and natural gas transportation long term service agreements capital projects operating leases total contractual cash obligations includes the tua with gbt which is contingent upon final construction costs and reaching commercial operation 
amounts based on estimated usage 
capital projects include nv energize 
additionally  sppc  as a joint owner  has obligations regarding the construction of on line 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan matters nve has a qualified pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan which cover substantially all employees of nve  npc and sppc 
the annual net benefit cost for the plans is expected to decrease in by approximately million compared to the cost of million 
as of december   the measurement date  the plan was under funded under the provisions of the compensation retirement benefits topic of the fasc 
refer to note  retirement plan and post retirement benefits  of the notes to financial statements 
during  nve funded a total of million to the trusts established for the qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
at the present time  it is not anticipated that additional funding will be required in to meet the minimum funding level requirements defined by the pension protection act of however  nve and the utilities have included in their assumptions funding levels similar to the funding 
the amounts to be contributed in may change subject to market conditions 
financing transactions million revolving credit facility sppc s million revolving credit facility contains a provision which reduces the availability under the credit facility by the negative mark to market exposure for hedging transactions with credit facility lenders or their energy trading affiliates 
the reduction in availability limits the amount that sppc can borrow or use for letters of credit and would require that sppc prepay any amount in excess of that limitation 
the amount of the reduction is calculated by sppc on a monthly basis  and after calculating such reduction  the sppc credit agreement provides that reduction in the availability under the revolving credit facility to sppc shall not exceed of the total commitments then in effect under the revolving credit facility 
the sppc credit agreement contains one financial maintenance covenant that requires sppc to maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capital  determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  not to exceed to in the event that sppc did not meet the financial maintenance covenant or there is an event of default  the sppc credit agreement would restrict dividends to nve 
moreover  so long as sppc s senior secured debt remains rated investment grade by s p and moody s in each case  with a stable or better outlook  a representation concerning no material adverse change in sppc s business  assets  property or financial condition would not be a condition to the availability of credit under the facility 
in the event that sppc s senior secured debt rating were rated below investment grade by either s p or moody s  or investment grade by either s p or moody s but with a negative outlook  a representation concerning no material adverse change in sppc s business  assets  property or financial condition would be a condition to borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
sppc s current revolving credit facility expires in april  however  management is currently renegotiating the terms and expects to close in early factors affecting liquidity ability to issue debt sppc s ability to issue debt is impacted by certain factors such as financing authority from the pucn  financial covenants in its financing agreements and its revolving credit facility agreement  and the terms of certain nve debt 
as of december   the most restrictive of the factors below is the pucn authority 
based on this restriction  sppc may issue up to million of long term debt securities  and maintain a credit facility of up to million 
however  depending on nve s or npc s issuance of long 
table of contents term debt or the use of the utilities revolving credit facilities  the pucn authority may not remain the most restrictive factor 
the factors affecting sppc s ability to issue debt are further detailed below a 
financing authority from the pucn as of december   sppc has financing authority from the pucn for the period ending december   consisting of authority to issue additional long term debt securities of up to million  to refinance approximately million of long term debt securities  and ongoing authority to maintain a revolving credit facility of up to million  b 
financial covenants within sppc s financing agreements under sppc s million revolving credit facility  the utility must maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capital  determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  not to exceed to based on december  financial statements  sppc was in compliance with this covenant and could incur up to million of additional indebtedness 
all other financial covenants contained in sppc s financing agreements are suspended  as sppc s senior secured debt is rated investment grade 
however  if sppc s senior secured debt ratings fall below investment grade by either moody s or s p  sppc would again be subject to the limitations under these additional covenants  and c 
financial covenants contained within nve s term loan as discussed in nve s ability to issue debt  sppc is also subject to nve s cap on additional consolidated indebtedness of billion 
ability to issue general and refunding mortgage securities to the extent that sppc has the ability to issue debt under the most restrictive covenants in its financing agreements and has financing authority to do so from the pucn  sppc s ability to issue secured debt is still limited by the amount of bondable property or retired bonds that can be used to issue debt under sppc s general and refunding mortgage indenture indenture 
the indenture creates a lien on substantially all of sppc s properties in nevada 
as of december   billion of sppc s general and refunding mortgage securities were outstanding 
sppc had the capacity to issue million of additional general and refunding mortgage securities as of december  that amount is determined on the basis of of net utility property additions  and or the principal amount of retired general and refunding mortgage securities 
property additions include plant in service and specific assets in cwip 
the amount of bond capacity listed above does not include eligible property in cwip 
sppc also has the ability to release property from the lien of the mortgage indenture on the basis of net property additions  cash and or retired bonds 
to the extent sppc releases property from the lien of sppc s indenture  it will reduce the amount of securities issuable under the indenture 
credit ratings the liquidity of sppc  the cost and availability of borrowing by sppc under its credit facility  the potential exposure of sppc to collateral calls under various contracts and the ability of sppc to acquire fuel and purchased power on favorable terms are all directly affected by the credit ratings for sppc s debt 
sppc s senior secured debt is rated investment grade by three nrsros fitch  moody s and s p 
in may  moody s upgraded sppc s senior secured debt to baa as of december   the ratings are as follows rating agency fitch moody s s p sppc sr 
secured debt bbb baa bbb investment grade fitch s lowest level of investment grade credit rating is bbb 
moody s lowest level of investment grade credit rating is baa s p s lowest level of investment grade credit rating is bbb 
fitch s  moody s and s p s rating outlook for sppc is stable 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
security ratings are subject to revision and withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
each security rating agency has its own methodology for assigning 
table of contents ratings  and  accordingly  each rating should be evaluated in the context of the applicable methodology  independently of all other ratings 
the rating agencies provide ratings at the request of the company being rated and charge the company fees for their services 
energy supplier matters with respect to sppc s contracts for purchased power  sppc purchases and sells electricity with counterparties under the wspp agreement  an industry standard contract that sppc uses as a member of the wspp 
the wspp contract is posted on the wspp website 
under these contracts  a material adverse change  which includes a credit rating downgrade  in sppc may allow the counterparty to request adequate financial assurance  which  if not provided within three business days  could cause a default 
most contracts and confirmations for purchased power have been modified or separate agreements have been made to either shorten the normal payment due date or require payment in advance of delivery in response to requests for financial assurance 
a default must be declared within days of the event  giving rise to the default becoming known 
a default will result in a termination payment equal to the present value of the net gains and losses for the entire remaining term of all contracts between the parties aggregated to a single liquidated amount due within three business days following the date the notice of termination is received 
the mark to market value  which is substantially based on quoted market prices  can be used to roughly approximate the termination payment and benefit at any point in time 
according to the net mark to market value as of december   no amounts would be due to or from sppc for all suppliers continuing to provide power under a wspp agreement 
these contracts qualify for the normal purchases scope exception as defined by the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasc  and as such  are not required to be mark to market on the balance sheet 
refer to note  derivatives and hedging activities  of the notes to financial statements  for further discussion 
gas supplier matters with respect to the purchase and sale of natural gas  sppc uses several types of standard industry contracts 
the natural gas contract terms and conditions are more varied than the electric contracts 
consequently  some of the contracts contain language similar to that found in the wspp agreement and other agreements have unique provisions dealing with material adverse change  which primarily means a credit rating downgrade below investment grade 
forward physical gas supplies are purchased under index based pricing terms and as such do not carry forward mark to market exposure 
most contracts and confirmations for natural gas purchases have been modified or separate agreements have been made to either shorten the normal payment due date or require payment in advance of delivery 
at the present time  no counterparties require payment in advance of delivery 
gas transmission service is secured under ferc tariffs or custom agreements 
these service contracts and tariffs require the user to establish and maintain creditworthiness to obtain service or otherwise post cash or a letter of credit to be able to receive service 
service contracts are subject to ferc approved tariffs  which  under certain circumstances  require the utilities to provide collateral to continue receiving service 
financial gas hedges sppc enters into certain hedging contracts with various counterparties to manage the gas price risk inherent in purchased power and fuel contracts 
as discussed under sppc s financing transactions  the availability under sppc s revolving credit facility is reduced by the amount of net negative mark to market positions on hedging contracts with counterparties who are lenders to the revolving credit facility  provided that the reduction in availability under the revolving credit facility shall at no time exceed of the total commitments then in effect under the revolving credit facility 
as a result of the suspension of the utilities hedging program  there was no negative mark to market exposure for sppc as of november  that would impact credit availability during the month of december beginning in october  the utilities suspended their hedging programs  however  prior to the suspension  it was the general policy of the utilities to purchase hedges three seasons ahead 
as a result certain hedges entered into prior to the suspension in october  did not terminate until as of november  all hedging transactions have expired or terminated and the utilities remain unhedged 
if deemed prudent  the utilities may still purchase hedging instruments in the event circumstances occur that may have the potential to increase the cost of fuel and purchased power 
cross default provisions none of the financing agreements of sppc contains a cross default provision that would result in an event of default by sppc upon an event of default by nve or npc under any of its financing agreements 
in addition  certain financing agreements of sppc provide for an event of default if there is a failure under other financing agreements of sppc to meet payment terms or to observe other covenants that would result in an acceleration of payments due 
most of these default provisions other than ones relating to a failure to pay such other indebtedness when due provide for a cure period of days from the occurrence of a specified event during which time sppc may rectify or correct the situation before it becomes an event of default
