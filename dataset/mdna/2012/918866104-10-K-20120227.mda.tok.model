item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or md a 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial or that are not specific to us  such as general economic conditions  may also adversely affect our business and operations 
the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with md a and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and make it more difficult for us to service our debt or obtain additional financing  if necessary 
our substantial level of indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 
as a result of our significant amount of debt and debt service obligations  we face increased risks regarding  among other things  the following our ability to borrow additional amounts or refinance existing indebtedness in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  investments  stock repurchases  execution of our growth strategy  or other purposes may be limited or such financing may be more costly  we have reduced availability of cash flow to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures  investments  acquisitions or other strategic initiatives and other general corporate purposes because a substantial portion of our cash flow is needed to pay principal and interest on our debt  we are more vulnerable to competitive pressures and to general adverse economic or industry conditions  including fluctuations in market interest rates or a downturn in our business  we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have greater financial resources than us  including news america and its parent corporation  it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition if we were unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing  as needed 
in addition  the indentures governing our unsecured senior notes due  or the notes  and our senior secured convertible notes due  or the secured notes  and our senior secured credit facility contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interest 
our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all of our debt 
we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay such debt  if accelerated  or that we would be able to repay  refinance or restructure the payments on such debt 
see the restrictive covenants in our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the notes and the secured notes and any of the agreements governing our future indebtedness could adversely restrict our financial and operating flexibility and subject us to other risks 

table of contents despite our current indebtedness levels and the restrictive covenants set forth in the agreements governing our indebtedness  we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness 
this could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 
the terms of our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our notes and the secured notes permit us and our subsidiaries including non guarantor subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness  including additional secured indebtedness  and other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness 
if we or our subsidiaries are in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in these agreements  if any  we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness  including secured indebtedness 
the indentures governing our notes and notes allow us to issue additional notes and other indebtedness in certain circumstances which may also be guaranteed by the guarantors and future domestic subsidiaries 
in addition  under certain circumstances we will have the right to increase the size of our senior secured credit facility and incur additional secured indebtedness thereunder 
as of december   we had million available under the revolving line of credit portion of our senior secured credit facility after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit 
if new indebtedness is added to our or our subsidiaries current indebtedness levels  the related risks that we and they now face could intensify 
we may not be able to generate a sufficient amount of cash flow to meet our debt obligations 
our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to our indebtedness depends on our future financial and operating performance  which  in turn  will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and certain financial  business  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt  we will be in default and  as a result  holders of our debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest on our debt to be due and payable and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 
if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations  we would face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay scheduled expansions and capital expenditures  sell material assets or operations  obtain additional capital  restructure our debt or revise or delay our strategic plans 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our operating performance  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for payment of our debt in the future 
if we are required to take any of the actions referred to above  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us  or at all  that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments 
in addition  any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants  which could further restrict our business operations 
the restrictive covenants in our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the notes and the secured notes and any of the agreements governing our future indebtedness could adversely restrict our financial and operating flexibility and subject us to other risks 
our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the notes and the secured notes contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries ability to take certain actions 
our senior secured credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial conditions 
our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the notes and the secured notes also restrict  among other things  our and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends and make other restricted payments  make certain investments  loans and advances  create or permit certain liens  issue or sell capital interests of restricted subsidiaries  use the proceeds from sales of assets and subsidiary interests  
table of contents enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates  create or permit restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and sell all or substantially all of our assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies 
these restrictions may limit our ability to operate our business and may prohibit or limit our ability to execute our business strategy  compete  enhance our operations  take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise or meet our capital needs 
furthermore  future debt instruments or other contracts could contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable to our senior secured credit facility  the secured notes or the notes 
the breach of any of these covenants by us or the failure by us to meet any of these conditions or requirements could result in a default under any or all of such indebtedness 
our ability to continue to comply with these covenants and requirements may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
an event of default under our debt agreements could trigger events of default under our other debt agreements and the holders of the defaulted debt could declare all of the amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to become immediately due and payable 
if such acceleration occurs  we would not be able to repay our debt and we may not be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance our debt 
even if new financing is made available to us  it may not be on terms acceptable to us 
the borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are based on variable rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of an increase in interest rates 
as of december   million of aggregate indebtedness remains outstanding under our senior secured credit facility and was subject to variable interest rates 
however  in december  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of december  and an initial notional amount of million  which amortizes by million at the end of each quarter subsequent to the effective date until it reaches million for the quarter ended june   the expiration date of the interest rate swap agreement 
this interest rate swap agreement effectively fixes  at including the current applicable margin  the interest rate for the portion of our variable rate debt outstanding under our senior secured credit facility equal to the outstanding notional amount of the interest rate swap agreement  which was million as of december  in addition  on july   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with an initial notional amount of million 
the effective date of this agreement is june  once effective  this interest rate swap agreement will effectively fix  at including the current applicable margin  the interest rate for the portion of our variable rate debt outstanding under our senior secured credit facility equal to the outstanding notional amount of the interest rate swap agreement 
the initial notional amount of million amortizes quarterly by i million from the effective date through the quarter ended september   ii million from september  through the quarter ended september   and iii million from september  until june   the expiration date of the agreement 
as of december   the variable rate indebtedness outstanding under our senior secured credit facility in excess of the outstanding notional amount of the effective interest rate swap agreement described above was an aggregate principal amount of million  and is subject to interest rate risk  as our interest payments will fluctuate as the underlying interest rate changes 
if there is a increase in the eurodollar rate  the interest rate currently applicable to this variable rate indebtedness  and we do not alter the terms of our current interest rate swap agreements or enter into a new interest rate swap agreement  our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase by a total of million between january  and june   the maturity date of the senior secured credit facility  which would affect our cash flows and results of operations 
if we borrow additional amounts under the revolving line of credit portion of our senior secured credit facility  our interest rate risk may increase 

table of contents increased competition could reduce the demand for our products and services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
it is possible that alternative media or changes in promotional materials  strategies or coupon delivery methods  including  without limitation  as a result of declines in newspaper circulation  could make our products less attractive to our clients and could cause a loss of demand for our products and services 
our products that reach a large area at low cost compete in the cooperative fsi business principally with news america 
we compete for business primarily on the basis of price  category availability  targeting ability and customer service and relationships 
fsi prices have declined substantially over the last several years 
we cannot predict when  or if  fsi prices will stabilize or increase 
this has resulted generally in decreasing revenues and profitability for our fsi segment 
when fsi contracts come up for renewal  we may not be able to renew them on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  our primary competitor  news america  and its parent corporation  have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within the industries in which we operate and may have significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
during  news america took a greater market share and could take a greater market share going forward and cause us to lose business from our clients 
our shared mail segment is our largest revenue producer and most profitable segment 
our shared mail segment s media business faces intense competition based primarily on the ability to target selected potential consumers on a cost effective basis and provide a satisfactory return on advertising investment 
shared mail products also compete for advertising dollars against other forms of print and electronic media and other advertising in general 
competition for market share also comes from magazines  radio  broadcast and cable television  shoppers  the internet  other communications media and other advertising printers that operate in shared mail markets 
the extent and nature of such competition are  in large part  determined by the location and demographics of the markets targeted by a particular advertiser and the number of media alternatives in those markets 
shared mail clients and prospective clients are operating with lower advertising budgets  while trying to allocate their spending across a growing number of media channels 
they are increasingly faced with the challenge of doing more with less 
the failure to develop new products and services could result in the loss of clients to current or future competitors 
in addition  failure to gain market acceptance of new products and services could adversely affect growth 
our neighborhood targeted segment competes against commercial printers and media placement agencies for solo specialized promotional programs for single advertisers 
while both types of competitors have a history of competing on the basis of price to increase volume and improve economies of scale  commercial printers tend to be particularly aggressive during periods when they have unused capacity 
in addition  we compete with sunflower marketing with respect to our polybag advertising and sampling products 
to the extent our competitors in these businesses decide to compete more aggressively on price due to excess capacity or for other reasons  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our neighborhood targeted products also compete with several newspaper network groups in the rop market 
while entering the rop market does not require a significant investment in machinery and equipment  it does require a significant investment in systems and human resources in order to compete effectively 
an increase in the number of rop competitors could result in a loss of market share 
in our international  digital media services segment  our subsidiary  nch marketing services  inc  competes against carolina manufacturing services and carolina services  both owned by inmar  inc  and international outsourcing services  llc for coupon clearing and redemption services in the us  and our in store business competes against news america 
to the extent that our competitors in these businesses decide to compete more aggressively on price  it could lower our market share and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our shared mail segment depends on the usps for delivery of its products 
if the usps does not fulfill their obligations  our shared mail segment may lose clients and experience reduced revenues and profitability 
our shared mail segment s products are primarily delivered through the usps 
postage expense is our shared mail segment s largest expense 
the inability of the usps to deliver our shared mail segment s products on a timely basis or a significant reduction in the number of days the usps delivers mail could disrupt our shared mail segment s business and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  usps rates increase periodically  and we have no control over increases that may occur in the future 
an increase in the cost of postage combined with our shared mail segment s inability to successfully pass through such postage rate increase directly to its clients could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
significant increases in the cost of paper  which are beyond our control  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent upon the availability of paper to print our clients advertising circulars 
paper costs have historically experienced significant fluctuations 
during  we purchased approximately of our paper from a single supplier pursuant to a contract that expired at the end of and the remainder of our paper purchases were subject to variable market prices 
we intend to enter into new long term contracts in the future  however  we may be unable to do so upon similar terms and conditions  including price increase limitations and volume discounts 
changes in the supply of  or demand for  paper could affect the cost of paper or delivery times 
we do not engage in hedging activities to limit our exposure to increases in paper prices and we have a limited ability to pass increased costs along to our clients 
in the future  the price of paper may fluctuate significantly due to changes in supply and demand 
we cannot assure you that we will have access to paper in the necessary amounts or at reasonable prices or that any increases in paper costs would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the possibility of consolidation in our client base  the loss of clients to alternative advertising methods or decreases in the frequency or amount of clients programs could impact our revenue growth and profitability 
in recent years  there has been a growing trend toward retailer consolidation 
as a result of this consolidation  the number of retailers to which we sell our products and services may decline and lead to a decrease in our revenues 
in addition  we may lose clients due to the acquisition of such clients by companies that are not interested in using our products and services or that eliminate retail locations of our existing clients 
also  a client may decide to decrease its program frequency or modify the amount  pages and weight  and kind of advertising pieces it purchases from us  whether due to the increased use of alternative advertising methods or shifts in consumer behavior  such as the recent increase in coupon redemption rates that has increased the cost per program for our clients  which has resulted in our clients in the consumer packaged goods vertical reducing the number of programs across many of our products 
our clients may be impacted by the items detailed above and by other general economic and business conditions that could affect their demand for our products and services 
in the event of significant revenue decreases in our shared mail segment  we may experience a corresponding impact to profit due to the fixed cost nature of postage expense 
postage costs associated with advertising packages are fixed in nature for packages that weigh ounces or less  whether or not the package is partially or completely filled 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our clients may be susceptible to changes in general economic conditions 
our revenues are affected by our clients marketing spending and advertising budgets 
our revenues and results of operations may be subject to fluctuations based upon general economic conditions in the geographic locations where we offer services or distribute content 
a continued recession or slower than anticipated improvement in economic conditions in these geographic locations may 
table of contents reduce demand for our products and services or depress pricing or prevent us from increasing pricing of those products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to products and services for which we do not have competitive advantages  and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain 
in addition  if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions  we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes  and our business could be negatively affected 
we depend on vendors to timely supply us with quality materials at the right prices 
global economic and political conditions may affect our vendors 
a prolonged economic downturn could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable materials at affordable prices 
to the extent that the financial condition of our vendors changes or deteriorates  including possible bankruptcies  mergers or liquidations or their sales otherwise decline  we may need to find alternative vendors 
our inability to acquire suitable materials on acceptable terms or in a timely manner or the loss of key vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if a client experiences financial difficulty  or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations as they become due  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if a client s financial difficulties become severe  the client may be unwilling or unable to pay our invoices in the ordinary course of business  which could adversely affect collections of both our accounts receivable and unbilled services 
bankruptcy filings by or relating to one of our clients could bar us from collecting pre bankruptcy debts from that client 
a client bankruptcy would delay our efforts to collect past due balances and could ultimately preclude full collection of these amounts 
we may recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims in the event of the bankruptcy and there is no guarantee our allowance for doubtful accounts would adequately cover such unrecovered amounts  which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
failure to maintain adequate internal controls may affect our ability to report timely and accurate financial statements and adversely affect our business and stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that companies design and maintain an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting and assess and report on such internal control structure annually 
such a system of controls  however well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the system are met 
in addition  the design of any internal control system is based in part upon certain assumptions regarding the likelihood of future events 
because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems  there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  regardless of how remote 
there can be no assurance that our internal control systems and procedures will not result in or lead to a future material weakness  or that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future 
a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting would require our management and independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate our internal controls as ineffective 
furthermore  if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls  our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be impaired 
if our internal control over financial reporting is not considered adequate  or if as a result we are unable to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis  we may  among other things  experience a loss of public confidence  which could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

table of contents because we self insure a number of our benefit plans  unexpected changes in claim trends may negatively impact our financial condition 
we self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation program and medical benefits claims 
while we maintain third party stop loss insurance policies to cover certain liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts  unexpected changes in claim trends  including the severity and frequency of claims  actuarial estimates and medical cost inflation could result in costs that are significantly different than initially reported 
if future claims related liabilities increase due to unforeseen circumstances  our self insurance costs could increase significantly 
due to uncertainty in the application and interpretation of applicable state sales tax laws  we may be exposed to additional sales tax liability 
the application and interpretation of applicable state sales tax laws to certain of our products is uncertain 
accordingly  we may be exposed to additional sales tax liability to the extent various state jurisdictions determine that certain of our products are subject to such jurisdictions sales tax 
we have recorded a liability of million  reflecting our best estimate of our potential sales tax liability 
while we believe all of our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and will be sustained upon audit  the actual liabilities may exceed such estimates 
if so  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the uncertainty of current economic and political conditions make budgeting and forecasting difficult and may reduce sales promotion spending 
the future direction of the overall domestic and global economies could have a significant impact on our business 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  increased global conflicts and the escalation of existing conflicts has created worldwide uncertainties that may have a negative impact on demand for our products 
in addition  the continuing economic downturn of the past several years has decreased the advertising budgets of our client base  which could have a material impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
because all components of our budgeting and forecasting  as well as that of our clients  are dependent upon estimates of growth in the markets served and demand for our products and services  the global economic downturn of the past several years and related financial market uncertainties may render estimates of future income and expenditures even more difficult to make than usual 
future events that may not have been anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these risk factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward looking statements are illustrative 
accordingly  all forward looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty
