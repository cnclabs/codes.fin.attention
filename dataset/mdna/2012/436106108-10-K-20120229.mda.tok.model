also included in the capital budget are yield improvement projects that address both the fcc unit and the coker 
a previously appropriated project which we expect to complete during is the replacement of an existing coker furnace with more current furnace technology 
this project is expected to improve coker on stream factor and reduce fuel consumption 
we expect to complete this project in late 
table of contents tulsa refineries the most significant newly appropriated capital project for our tulsa refineries is conversion of a propane de asphalt unit to rose technology 
this project is expected to cost million and will increase processing of vacuum tower bottoms  increase the production of bright stock lube  reduce energy consumption  and allow the shutdown of a low pressure steam boiler 
projects still underway from prior appropriations include a million project to recover sulfur from the refinery fuel gas system and to shut down another low pressure steam boiler by electrification of turbine drivers 
the sulfur recovery project is required to comply with our epa consent decree but is being enhanced so as to increase our capacity to run lower priced sour heavy crude in tulsa 
we are also executing an lpg recovery project in tulsa at an estimated total cost of million 
this project will improve overall liquid yields and enable us to substitute lower priced natural gas for lpg s currently being consumed as refinery fuel 
other projects underway in tulsa involve replacement of an existing vacuum tower and improvements to our wastewater treatment plants and storm water retention systems 
navajo refinery we have approved a new project for the navajo refinery to remove sulfur and other contaminants from the crude unit off gas stream  this will improve liquid yields and reduce refinery fuel costs 
current spending on previously appropriated projects includes an msat project naphtha splitting and benzene saturation to reduce reliance on benzene credits purchases  as well as expenditures to improve the artesia waste water handling and processing facilities 
cheyenne refinery we have approved four new compliance projects for the cheyenne refinery including wastewater treatment plant improvements  a wet gas scrubber for the fcc unit to reduce particulate and other emissions  msat related investments to reduced benzene in gasoline  and spending for additional tail gas unit associated with our sulfur recovery facilities 
we also plan to improve metallurgy on portions of the cheyenne refinery s delayed coking unit 
these new major capital appropriations total approximately million  and we expect to spend approximately of this amount on these projects during expenditures for msat compliance projects were accelerated by approximately one year at each of the cheyenne and el dorado refineries due to the holly frontier merger  this followed our loss of a small refiner exemption that previously provided for delayed compliance with this standard 
woods cross refinery we plan to significantly expand our woods cross refinery in response to increased availability of locally produced black wax crude oil 
we have announced a year crude supply agreement with newfield exploration company under which we will purchase  bpd of waxy crudes black and yellow wax 
our expansion project will increase crude processing capacity of woods cross from  bpd to  bpd 
most of the incremental crude supply is expected to be waxy crude  and the expansion is being configured to create high liquid yields and relatively large proportions of additional gasoline and diesel fuel in comparison to the increased crude charge 
we expect this million project to have a pre tax payback period of approximately two years  and we expect to complete the expansion in approximately the fourth quarter of our execution of this project is subject to certain contingencies  including our receipt of required emissions and other permits 
also at woods cross  we have two significant compliance projects authorized in prior year appropriations 
the first of these involves installation of a wet gas scrubber on the fcc unit to reduce particulate and other emissions and the second relates to msat compliance which will require naphtha fractionation and benzene saturation 
unev the unev pipeline  in which we own a equity interest  was mechanically completed in november linefill and startup procedures commenced thereafter  and the pipeline and associated product terminals in cedar city  utah and las vegas  nevada were operational during the first quarter of we believe that the unev pipeline will play an important role in offsetting seasonal declines in product demand  characteristic of the salt lake city refined products market 
we also believe that unev will facilitate a growing north to south flow of refined products which we expect will result from the advantaged crude oil economics enjoyed by padd iv rocky mountain refiners 
we plan to spend an additional million in on capital items associated with the completion and startup of unev  and our estimate of total installed cost is now million for our interest in this pipeline 

table of contents regulatory compliance items or other presently existing or future environmental regulations consent decrees could cause us to make additional capital investments beyond those described above and incur additional operating costs in order to meet applicable requirements 
hep each year the holly logistic services  llc board of directors approves hep s annual capital budget  which specifies capital projects that hep management is authorized to undertake 
additionally  at times when conditions warrant or as new opportunities arise  special projects may be approved 
the funds allocated for a particular capital project may be expended over a period of several years  depending on the time required to complete the project 
therefore  hep s planned capital expenditures for a given year consist of expenditures approved for capital projects included in its current year capital budget as well as  in certain cases  expenditures approved for capital projects in capital budgets for prior years 
the hep capital budget is comprised of million for maintenance capital expenditures and million for expansion capital expenditures 
hep has recently made certain modifications to its crude oil gathering and trunk line system that have effectively increased hep s ability to gather and transport an additional  bpd of delaware basin crude oil in response to increased drilling activity in southeast new mexico 
furthermore  hep has developed a project to replace a mile section of this pipeline system that will allow for an additional  bpd of capacity that will be executed as needed if delaware basin crude volumes continue to increase 
this project is estimated to cost approximately million 
hep has a second project which consists of the reactivation and conversion to crude oil service of a mile  inch petroleum products pipeline owned by hep 
once in service  this pipeline will initially be capable of transporting up to  bpd of crude oil from southeast new mexico to third party common carrier pipelines in west texas for further transport to major crude oil markets 
the scope of this project is being finalized

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical to understanding the judgments that are involved and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements description of business and summary of significant accounting policies 
inventory valuation our crude oil and refined product inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the lifo inventory valuation methodology and market is determined using current estimated selling prices 
under the lifo method  the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at the earliest acquisition costs 
in periods of rapidly declining prices  lifo inventories may have to be written down to market value due to the higher costs assigned to lifo layers in prior periods 
in addition  the use of the lifo inventory method may result in increases or decreases to cost of sales in years when inventory volumes decline and result in charging cost of sales with lifo inventory costs generated in prior periods 
as of december   many of our lifo inventory layers were valued at historical costs that were established in years when price levels were generally lower  therefore  our results of operation are less sensitive to current market price reductions 
as of december   the excess of current cost over the lifo inventory value of our crude oil and refined product inventories was million 
an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels at that time 
accordingly  interim lifo calculations are based on management s estimates of expected year end inventory levels and are subject to the final year end lifo inventory valuation 

table of contents deferred maintenance costs our refinery units require regular major maintenance and repairs that are commonly referred to as turnarounds 
catalysts used in certain refinery processes also require routine change outs 
the required frequency of the maintenance varies by unit and by catalyst  but generally is every two to five years 
in order to minimize downtime during turnarounds  we utilize contract labor as well as our maintenance personnel on a continuous hour basis 
whenever possible  turnarounds are scheduled so that some units continue to operate while others are down for maintenance 
we record the costs of turnarounds as deferred charges and amortize the deferred costs over the expected periods of benefit 
long lived assets we calculate depreciation and amortization based on estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
when assets are placed into service  we make estimates with respect to their useful lives that we believe are reasonable 
however  factors such as competition  regulation or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization 
we evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment by identifying whether indicators of impairment exist and  if so  assessing whether the long lived assets are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
the actual amount of impairment loss  if any  to be recorded is equal to the amount by which a long lived asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
estimates of future discounted cash flows and fair values of assets require subjective assumptions with regard to future operating results and actual results could differ from those estimates 
no impairments of long lived assets were recorded during the years ended december   and intangibles and goodwill intangible assets are assets other than financial assets that lack physical substance 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
goodwill acquired in a business combination and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized while intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired 
there were no impairments of intangible assets or goodwill during the years ended december   and variable interest entity hep is a vie as defined under gaap 
a vie is legal entity whose equity owners do not have sufficient equity at risk or a controlling interest in the entity  or have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interest 
as the general partner of hep  we have the sole ability to direct the activities of hep that most significantly impact hep s economic performance 
additionally  since our obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits from hep are significant to hep  we are hep s primary beneficiary and therefore we consolidate hep 
contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
new accounting pronouncements presentation of comprehensive income in june  an accounting standard update was issued that requires the presentation of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive  statements and eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
this standard is effective january  and will be applied retrospectively 
this update will not have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment in september  an accounting standard update was issued that allows entities an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
this standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing beginning january  this standard will not have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risk management we use certain strategies to reduce some commodity price and operational risks 
we do not attempt to eliminate all market risk exposures when we believe that the exposure relating to such risk would not be significant to our future earnings  financial position  capital resources or liquidity or that the cost of eliminating the exposure would outweigh the benefit 
commodity price risk management our primary market risk is commodity price risk 
we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in crude oil and refined products  as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations 
we periodically enter into derivative contracts in the form of commodity price swaps to mitigate price exposure with respect to our inventory positions  natural gas purchases  costs of crude oil  prices of refined products  and our refining margins 
as of december   we have outstanding swap contracts serving as cash flow hedges against price risk on forecasted purchases of  barrels of wti crude oil and forecasted sales of  barrels of ultra low sulfur diesel and  barrels of conventional unleaded gasoline 
in the aggregate  these cash flow hedges effectively hedge our gross margin on forecasted gasoline and diesel sales  totaling  bpd in we also have swap contracts that lock in the spread between gasoline and butane on forecasted sales  barrels of gasoline through january and nymex futures contracts to lock in prices on forecasted sales and purchases of inventory  barrels and  barrels  respectively  through 
interest rate risk management hep uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk 
as of december  hep has an interest rate swap contract that hedges hep s exposure to the cash flow risk caused by the effects of libor changes on a million hep credit agreement advance 
this interest rate swap effectively converts million of libor based debt to fixed rate debt having an interest rate of plus an applicable margin  currently  which equaled an effective interest rate of as of december  this swap matures in february the following table presents balance sheet locations and related fair values of outstanding derivative instruments 
these amounts are presented on a gross basis in accordance with gaap disclosure requirements and do not reflect the netting of asset or liability positions permitted under the terms of master netting arrangements 
therefore  they are not equal to amounts presented in our consolidated balance sheets 
additionally  we held million of cash on margin at december  to collateralize certain counterparty positions 
these deposits have an offsetting current liability on our balance sheet and are not included in the amounts below

these counterparties are large financial institutions 
we have not experienced  nor do we expect to experience  any difficulty in the counterparties honoring their commitments 
the market risk inherent in our fixed rate debt and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 
for the fixed rate hollyfrontier senior notes and hep senior notes  changes in interest rates will generally affect fair value of the debt  but not our earnings or cash flows

at december   borrowings outstanding under the hep credit agreement were million 
by means of its cash flow hedge  hep has effectively converted the variable rate on million of outstanding principal to a fixed rate of 
for the unhedged million portion  a hypothetical change in interest rates applicable to the hep credit agreement would not materially affect cash flows 
at december   cash and cash equivalents included investments in investment grade  highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase and hence the interest rate market risk implicit in these cash investments is low 
due to the short term nature of our cash and cash equivalents  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
since we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 

table of contents our operations are subject to normal hazards of operations  including fire  explosion and weather related perils 
we maintain various insurance coverages  including business interruption insurance  subject to certain deductibles 
we are not fully insured against certain risks because such risks are not fully insurable  coverage is unavailable  or premium costs  in our judgment  do not justify such expenditures

reconciliations to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles reconciliations of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles in financial statements 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  which we refer to as ebitda  is calculated as income from continuing operations plus i interest expense  net of interest income  ii income tax provision  and iii depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is not a calculation provided for under gaap  however  the amounts included in the ebitda calculation are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as an indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebitda is presented here because it is a widely used financial indicator used by investors and analysts to measure performance 
ebitda is also used by our management for internal analysis and as a basis for financial covenants

refinery gross margin and net operating margin are non gaap performance measures that are used by our management and others to compare our refining performance to that of other companies in our industry 
we believe these margin measures are helpful to investors in evaluating our refining performance on a relative and an absolute basis 
refinery gross margin per barrel is the difference between average net sales price and average cost of products per barrel of produced refined products 
net operating margin per barrel is the difference between refinery gross margin and refinery operating expenses per barrel of produced refined products 
these two margins do not include the effect of depreciation and amortization 
each of these component performance measures can be reconciled directly to our consolidated statements of income 
other companies in our industry may not calculate these performance measures in the same manner
