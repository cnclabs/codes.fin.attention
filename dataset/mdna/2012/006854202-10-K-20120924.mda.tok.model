the need for automation key benefits of automation include improved control  efficiency and productivity  higher and more consistent quality  and improved record keeping 
for decades  industries such as automotive assembly and electronics have used robotic systems in 
table of contents their manufacturing operations to stay competitive  reduce costs and provide a safer environment for workers 
such industries are heavily dependent on automation to manufacture  assemble and package their products 
in many other industries  the use of automation is only just beginning  spurred by changes in the regulatory and competitive environment  and always with a focus on achieving greater productivity at a lower cost 
packaging the use of packaging around commercial products continues to increase  as factors such as expediency  variety and safety have become more important to consumers 
additionally  packaging can deliver benefits such as convenience  branding or market differentiation 
increased use of packaging in various consumer products is fueling the need for automation to address the challenges that arise in the packaging process 
these challenges include the need for flexibility  the need to maintain a clean or sterile environment  the ability to process high volumes and the ability to track products that are perishable or that may pose future unknown risks 
cost considerations are also an important catalyst for automated packaging  particularly in applications such as food  where products are often packaged locally for reasons including freshness  regional branding or specific regulatory requirements 
automation is often a more cost efficient alternative to maintaining a relatively larger number of employees as productivity can be achieved more quickly  in less space and with less risk of contamination 
additionally  in packaging applications such as food or consumer goods  the need for flexibility is becoming more pronounced as manufacturers strive to provide more variety for their customers 
this is causing the line to blur between packaging and related activities such as warehousing and distribution 
for example  a snack food producer might want to pack cartons for a particular destination with a bundled product offering versus a single product offering 
logistics one of the largest sectors where logistics is of primary consideration is in warehousing and distribution 
according to the us census bureau   warehouse and storage facilities were in operation within the united states in with employment of  workers who earned annual wages of nearly billion 
managers of these processes are faced with multiple operational and environmental challenges while simultaneously facing ever increasing customer service requirements 
automation is more often a financially attractive alternative to manual processes for not only the labor cost savings  but also due to the potential improvements in productivity  order accuracy  reduced space requirements  increased volume capacity  and control of inventory 
while this growth in automation is occurring  there is also a need for supply chains to become more agile to serve rapidly changing markets 
to address these divergent requirements  automation is being required to offer heightened levels of flexibility 
this is increasingly achieved through the use of mobile technologies such as autonomous indoor vehicles referred to as aiv and their associated control and software solutions 
modern aiv solutions not only offer the operational gains mentioned above  but represent significant savings for their users when deployment and total cost of ownership are compared to more traditional forms of automation 
medical in the united states healthcare spending is a significant component of the economy 
factors such as high healthcare costs  an aging population and legislation of the industry  including the legislation ensuring access to medical care and limiting procedure based payments to providers  are driving the increased use of automation within the medical market to lower costs and increase efficiency 
automation is used in the medical market for a range of medical  pharmaceutical and healthcare related applications  including the manufacture of medical devices  the automation of repetitive operations in diagnostic and pharmaceutical labs  automated processing of mail order pharmaceutical sales  automated transportation tasks in hospital environments  and computer assisted robot based surgical procedures 
automation provides many advantages  including minimizing opportunities for contamination  ensuring consistency and precision of processes  documentation of all process steps for subsequent tracking or review  enhancing efficiency by freeing highly skilled workers for other tasks  and reducing overall costs 
solar the growing desire of consumers and governments for reduced dependence on oil  natural gas and coal and global concerns about fossil fuel pollution and climate change are spurring the commercial development of solar panels to provide clean  renewable energy 
however  the equipment infrastructure and the expertise to manufacture solar energy devices are in an early phase of development 
today  government subsidies and technological expertise are fueling the first concentrated development of solar manufacturing in certain regions  such as germany and the silicon valley of california 
additionally  manufacturers in asia are ramping up their build capacity for solar cell production 
while economic concerns are currently constricting the pace of this development  over the next several years  solar energy production is expected to increase in almost every area of the world 
similar to the semiconductor industry  the solar market is expected to be cyclical  with periods of investment in capacity followed by periods of capacity absorption 

table of contents automation brings benefits at many stages of the delicate and exacting process of solar cell and panel manufacturing 
for example  automation allows manufacturers to produce higher volumes in less space  ensures that product specifications can be precisely replicated to ensure consistent product quality  and reduces breakage to enable higher yields 
based on similarities in processes and products  the solar industry is expected to develop along similar lines as the heavily automated semiconductor industry over the longer term 
consequently  automation will likely continue to be an important tool for manufacturers as solar cell and panel production technology evolves 
improvements to the technology such as smaller wafer dimensions  larger die size and a larger number of pins will create additional challenges in terms of consistency  quality and yield 
disk drive electronics the combination of high volumes and continual price erosion in the disk drive electronics market has long demanded the use of automation to ensure the highest yields at the lowest cost 
automation solutions are used to help manufacture and assemble a host of electronic products such as computer disk drives  cell phones and printer cartridges and components 
this market is very cyclical in terms of its investment in automation technology  with periods of significant investment in adding capacity or enhancing existing systems typically followed by periods of relatively low investment 
automotive and industrial automation enables important benefits in the automotive and industrial markets  including higher yields  better and more consistent quality and lower cost 
in automotive applications  automation can provide the speed and precision required to handle small  high volume components such as sensors and electronic components 
in industrial manufacturing applications  the automation of machine tools and other industrial equipment provides a more productive and safer alternative to human labor 
additionally  automation plays an important role in containing costs in high labor cost regions such as europe  where governmental policies have encouraged automotive and industrial manufacturing to remain local

financial information regarding revenue derived from domestic and international customers and long lived assets based upon geographic area is included in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
sales and distribution we market our products through systems integrators  sales representatives and distributors  our direct sales force and oems 
systems integrators we ship a substantial portion of our products through system integrators  and we view our relationships with these organizations as important to our success 
we have established relationships with more than system integrators worldwide that provide expertise and process knowledge for a wide range of specific applications 
in the united states and europe  these relationships are generally nonexclusive and not limited to specific geographical territories 
in certain other international markets  our integrator relationships may include limited exclusive arrangements for a limited geographical territory in which the integrator markets and supports adept functions directly 
generally  a systems integrator can purchase both standard and non standard adept solutions and components as opposed to oem arrangements  where generally one standard component or solution is purchased in higher volumes 
sales representatives and distributors we utilize a network of sales representatives and distributors in many areas of the world to provide cost effective sales coverage in smaller markets where it is prohibitively expensive for us to allocate direct sales resources 
we use a combination 
table of contents of exclusive adept product only and non exclusive sales representatives and distributors who sell our robot and vision guidance products in their standard forms 
we also provide service and support for customers who have purchased adept products through one of our sales representatives or distributors 
direct sales force we employ a sales force of sales personnel and application engineers that currently is organized around our primary target markets and that sells to both end users and our indirect channel partners 
with respect to end users  the sales force directs its efforts to communicate the capabilities of our products and support services and obtain up to date information regarding market requirements 
our sales force possesses expertise in automation solutions and advises end users on alternative production line designs  special application techniques  equipment sources and system integrator selection 
our sales force also works closely with systems integrators and oems to integrate our product line into their systems  provides sales leads to certain systems integrators and obtains intelligent automation system quotes from systems integrators for end users 
as of june   we had employees engaged in sales and marketing 
some of our larger manufacturing end user customers  to whom we sell directly  have in house engineering departments that are comparable to a captive systems integrator 
these end user customers establish a corporate integrator relationship with us offering benefits similar to those provided to our integrator distribution channel  however  in some cases we may form strategic alliances for certain potentially high volume market opportunities with greater benefits to the customer than exist in system integrator arrangements  although the benefits may come with contractual restrictions 
oems our oem customers typically purchase one standard product configuration  which the oem integrates with additional hardware and software and sells under the oem s label to other resellers and end users 
unlike our systems integrator channel  oems are responsible for all marketing  sales and customer support and for maintaining the associated spare parts to service the end users of the integrated product 
research and development we focus our research and development efforts on the development of an integrated product line  which furthers our factory automation approach and which reduces costs  enhances performance  and improves ease of use for our customers 
research and development activities are focused on the design of our motion and vision control hardware and the robotic mechanisms that utilize them along with advanced software for vision  motion control and applications 
in both our primary research and development facility in california and our development facility in france  we focus on the development of motion controls  robot mechanisms  vision software  real time application software and the development of the adept pac and the next generation mt we also have a development facility in new hampshire  where we focus on mobile robot technology and platforms  autonomous navigation software and controls 
we have devoted  and intend to devote in the future  a significant portion of our resources to research and development programs 
as of june   we had employees engaged in research  development and engineering 
our research  development and engineering expenses were approximately million in fiscal  representing of revenues  and million in fiscal  representing of revenues 
manufacturing the majority of our robot mechanisms are sourced externally and our manufacturing operations  which are located in pleasanton  california  and dortmund  germany  are focused on product assembly  integration and testing 
we strategically outsource sub components of our systems  including electronic assemblies and mechanical mechanisms 
our manufacturing engineering organization develops test processes and detailed instructions for all manufacturing and test operations 
these instructions are established in writing  implemented through training of the manufacturing workforce  and monitored to assure compliance 
in addition  our manufacturing organization works closely with our suppliers to develop instructions  test methods and to remedy technical or quality problems if they arise 
certain components and sub assemblies incorporated into our products are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers 
we routinely monitor single source supply parts  and we endeavor to ensure that adequate inventory is available to maintain manufacturing schedules should the supply of any part be interrupted 
although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole or limited source suppliers  we have not qualified a second source for some of these products and the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have a materially negative impact on 
table of contents our results of operations and could damage customer relationships 
backlog our product backlog at june  was approximately million compared to approximately million at june  the decrease in backlog at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal is due to a slowdown seen in customer order patterns at the end of fiscal  especially in europe 
orders placed with delivery dates beyond twelve months from the end of the fiscal quarter are not included in backlog  and thus we expect substantially all backlog at june  to ship during fiscal because orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules and in certain instances may be subject to cancellation without significant penalty to the customer  our backlog at any date may not be indicative of demand for our products or actual revenues for any period in the future 
employees at june   we had employees worldwide 
of the total  were engaged in research and development  in sales and marketing  in service and support  in operations  and in finance and administration

risk factors our operating results fluctuate due to factors that are difficult to forecast  are often out of our control  and can be volatile 
our past operating results may not be accurate indicators of future performance  and you should not rely on such results to predict our future performance 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past  and could fluctuate in the future 
factors that may contribute to fluctuations include changes in aggregate capital spending  cyclicality and other economic conditions  or domestic and international demand in the industries we serve  our ability to effectively manage our working capital  changes in our products market acceptance or demand  new products or changes in pricing  by us  our distribution channels  or our competitors  pricing and availability of components and raw materials  changes in our product mix from quarter to quarter affecting our gross margins  our failure to manufacture a sufficient volume of products in a timely and cost effective manner  our inability to adjust certain fixed costs and expenses for changes in demand  impact of our restructuring activities on our operations  currency exchange rate fluctuations  shifts in geographic concentration of our sales or supply  seasonal fluctuations in demand and our revenue  our ability to expand our product offerings  and extraordinary events such as litigation  claims or mergers and acquisitions 
we generally recognize revenues upon shipment  or in certain cases upon receipt by customers 
as a result  our net revenues and results of operations are affected by the timing of orders received and shipped 
a significant percentage of our shipments occur in the last month of each quarter 
this can make it difficult to reliably forecast the demand level for our products for a particular quarter 
further  an order cancellation  reduction or delay in shipments near the end of a fiscal period may cause sales to fall below expectations and harm our operating results for that period 
we have and may also enter into agreements requiring 
table of contents us to accept certain orders meeting agreed criteria and to hold specified levels of inventory available 
to address these difficulties  we periodically stock inventory levels of completed robots  machine controllers and certain strategic components 
as a result  our operating results vary  our stock price is volatile  and we may not be able to achieve or sustain our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we have experienced operating losses and negative cash flow in the past  and have limited liquidity resources  which could impair our ability to invest in growth and adversely affect our operations 
we have experienced operating losses and negative cash flow  and if our projected revenue fails to increase or our expenses exceed current expectations  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  adequately respond to competitive pressures or fully execute our business plan 
in june  we raised approximately million in connection with our public offering of common stock  and in september  we raised approximately million of net proceeds  after estimated expenses  in connection with our preferred stock financing 
while these financings have increased our cash resources  we had approximately million of debt outstanding at june   and though we are under no restrictions at this time regarding transferring cash from our foreign operations to our us operations  regulatory restrictions impeding our ability to transfer foreign cash reserves may occur in the future  and we may have limited access to a portion of those existing cash balances 
we depend on the cash raised from our recent financings  our credit facility and funds generated from operating activities to meet our operating requirements and execute our growth plan 
our preferred stock entitles the holders thereof to quarterly dividends at a fluctuating rate of up to  provides for certain elective installment payments in cash or stock subject to certain equity conditions  and is redeemable in and upon certain trigger events 
we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock 
additionally  our credit facility includes interest based upon our outstanding amounts and subjects us to certain financial and operating covenants  the failure of which would prevent us from borrowing 
if we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient capital on favorable terms  it could undermine our flexibility to pursue additional expansion opportunities and could limit the working capital available to our business  harming our operating results we depend on outsourced manufacturing and information technology capabilities and single source suppliers  and if we experience disruptions in this supply or prices increase  our business may suffer 
we outsource most of our manufacturing functions  and obtain many key components  materials and mechanical sub systems from sole or single source suppliers 
we have limited contracts or guaranteed supply arrangements with these suppliers  and the lack of alternate sources and lengthy qualification process for replacement suppliers involves significant risks 
these risks include whether or not new suppliers will provide adequate quantities with sufficient quality on a timely basis  and the risk that supplier pricing may be higher than anticipated 
if we are unable to obtain necessary items on a timely basis  at acceptable prices  and of sufficient quality  we could lose current or future business 
in the past  we have experienced quality control or specification problems with certain components provided by sole source suppliers  and have had to design around the particular flawed items 
any quality issues could result in customer dissatisfaction  lost sales  or increased warranty costs  and could harm our results of operations 
any significant price increase or disruption of our supply sources could interrupt our product shipments  require reengineering  and damage customer relationships 
if our suppliers cease manufacturing components that we require  we may need to purchase a significant amount of inventory that could lead to an increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
finally  if we incorrectly forecast product mix for a particular period and we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies of any components or mechanical sub systems on a timely and cost effective basis due to long procurement lead times  our business could be substantially impaired 
global economic conditions currently affecting our customers and suppliers may also negatively affect our financial results by decreasing our revenues and increasing our risk of credit related losses 
the global economic downturn over the last five years and the following european debt crisis has created a widespread slowdown in capital investment  manufacturing  and demand for consumer products particularly in our disk drive and solar markets 
in response  our suppliers have or may increase their prices or reduce their output 
some of our customers including systems integrators have  and may continue to defer  reduce or cease to place orders for our products  or may delay or default on their payment obligations  reducing our revenues or margins or increasing our credit losses  which would negatively affect our results of operations 
our inability to accurately forecast  or react quickly and adequately to increases or decreases in demand for our products could harm our business and results of operations 
intelligent automation systems using our products can range in price from  to  accordingly  our success directly depends upon the capital expenditure budgets of our customers  which tend to be cyclical 
the economic downturn resulted in cutbacks in capital spending in some of our major markets  and our business has been  and may continue to be  directly and negatively impacted 
industry downturns have been characterized by reduced demand for devices and equipment  production over capacity  and accelerated declines in average selling prices 
during periods of declining demand  we have 
table of contents implemented several worldwide restructuring programs to realign our business and lower our expenses accordingly 
however  our ability to reduce expenses is limited by our need to retain and motivate key employees  and by our need for continued investment in product engineering  research and development 
we also have extensive ongoing customer service and support requirements and must maintain a certain level of inventory to satisfy potential customer commitments  as well as administrative costs that cannot easily be reduced 
further  our failure to effectively manage product transitions or accurately forecast customer demand  in terms of both volume and configuration  may lead to an increased risk of excess or obsolete inventory 
we also must be able to maintain the ability to quickly increase our manufacturing capacity upon an increase in orders or general upturn in any of our markets 
typically  upturns in markets such as disk drive or electronics have been characterized by abrupt demand increases  and production under capacity 
we must be able to ramp up in times of increased demand and hire sufficiently to service our customers  and our inability to do so could cause current or future customers to place orders with our competitors instead 
our international operations and reliance on foreign suppliers subject us to risks outside of our control that may harm our operating results 
we have significant and expanding operations outside the united states  including a growing asian presence 
additionally  a substantial majority of our revenue is derived from non us sales international sales represented and of revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we expect that revenue from our international sales and operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue 
we also purchase some critical components from  and increasingly rely upon  foreign suppliers 
as a result  our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international sales  purchases  and operations which include difficulties coordinating operations subject to differing regulatory regimes  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  political  military  and economic instability or turmoil and extraordinary disruptions  restrictive governmental actions  such as tariff regulations and other trade barriers  transportation costs and delays  stringent local jurisdictional requirements favoring local business and organized labor considerations  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty collecting accounts receivables from foreign jurisdictions  potentially adverse tax rates  tax treatment of our intercompany transactions and consequences  and difficulty in obtaining appropriate personnel 
we face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  as a significant portion of our revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies 
additionally  we make foreign currency denominated purchases from some foreign suppliers  and thus remain subject to the transaction exposures that arise from foreign exchange movements between the date that the transactions are recorded and the date cash is paid 
continued fluctuations in foreign currencies could negatively impact our business 
as we are subject to the regulatory regimes of numerous governments  we must ensure that our operations comply with all applicable geographic requirements  including changing requirements affecting our business  and business and tax audits  by foreign authorities  the results of which cannot be assessed as to the amount of financial or operational exposure at this time 
in early  we opened a facility in shanghai  china to capitalize on significant opportunities presented by the asian markets 
we face all the risks inherent in operating in a foreign emerging market where we have not previously operated a facility 
our china based activities are subject to greater political  regulatory  legal and economic risks than those faced by other operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our expansion in china 
the long sales cycle  customer evaluation and implementation processes of our products may increase the costs of securing sales and reduce the predictability of our earnings 
our products are technologically complex  and prospective customers generally must commit significant resources to test and evaluate performance  and to install and integrate our products into larger systems 
as a result  our sales process is often subject to the evaluation and approval delays that are typically associated with large capital expenditures 
the sales cycles for our products often last for many months or even years  and orders expected in one quarter may shift to another or be canceled entirely because of customers budgetary constraints or internal acceptance reviews 
longer sales cycles require us to invest 
table of contents significant resources in attempting to secure sales that may not be realized in the short term  and therefore may delay or prevent revenue generation 
the time required for our customers to incorporate our product into their system can also vary significantly  which further complicates our planning processes and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
our failure to keep up with rapid technological change and new product development would harm our ability to compete 
the intelligent automation industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
we must anticipate trends in our customers industries and develop products before our customers products are commercialized  because many of our products are used by our customers to develop  manufacture  and test their own products 
if we do not accurately predict our customers needs  we may invest substantial development resources in products that may not achieve broad market acceptance 
further  if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products meeting customers changing technical specifications on a timely and cost effective basis  our products may become uncompetitive or obsolete 
we also must make decisions about whether or not to develop and offer products to a given market  and if our judgment of that market is incorrect  our business could be harmed 
the market for intelligent automation products is intensely competitive  which may make it difficult to grow our business or to maintain or enhance our profitability 
our competitors include robot  motion control  machine vision  and simulation software and packaging companies  many of which have substantially greater resources than we do 
our competitors in the robot market also include integrated manufacturers that produce robotics equipment for internal use  and also compete with our products for sales to other customers 
because they can generate substantial unit volumes to satisfy internal demand  these competitors may have greater pricing flexibility 
during the recent economic downturn  we have experienced aggressive price reductions and other accommodations by our competitors  in addition to increased price sensitivity by our customers 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products are product features  functionality  and ease of use  price  brand quality perception  customer service  and timeliness  predictability  and reliability of delivery 
increased competitive pressure and declining barriers to market entry could result in a loss of sales or market share or force us to lower prices 
failure to enhance our brand would impair our ability to increase or maintain our customer base  and we may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
the growth of our business depends upon the development and successful commercial acceptance of our new products 
our failure to develop  manufacture  and sell new products in quantities sufficient to offset a decline in revenue from existing products or to successfully manage product and related inventory transitions could harm our business 
we depend upon a variety of factors to ensure that our new and enhanced products are successfully commercialized  including timely and efficient completion of design and development  implementation of manufacturing processes  and effective sales  marketing  and customer service 
because of the complexity of our products  significant delays may occur in introducing new products  or between a product s initial introduction and volume production 
the development and commercialization of new products involve many difficulties  including identification of new product opportunities  retention and hiring of appropriate research and development personnel  determination of the product s technical specifications  successful completion of the development process  successful marketing of the new product and achieving customer acceptance  managing inventory levels  and additional customer service and warranty costs associated with supporting new product introductions and or effecting subsequent potential field upgrades 
we must expend significant financial and management resources to develop new products 
we cannot assure that we will receive meaningful revenue from these investments 
if we are unable to continue to successfully develop new products in 
table of contents response to customer requirements or technological changes  or our new products are not commercially successful  our business may be harmed 
our acquisitions of mobilerobots and inmotx have expanded our business with new technologies and solutions for additional markets  including our adept pac solutions for complex food processing and packaging applications  and mobile robotic systems  control and software for autonomous robot and agv applications 
we had little or no experience in these markets prior to the completion of these acquisitions and are unable to accurately forecast the future commercial acceptance of these additional product lines 
we generally have no long term customer contracts and our backlog cannot be relied upon as a future indicator of sales 
we generally do not have long term contracts with our customers  and existing contracts and purchase commitments may be canceled under certain circumstances 
as a result  we are exposed to competitive price pressures on every order  and our agreements with customers do not provide assurance of future sales 
our customers are not required to make minimum purchases and may cease purchasing our products at any time without penalty 
our backlog should not be relied on as a measure of anticipated demand or future revenue  because the orders constituting our backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules and may be subject to cancellation without significant penalty to the customer 
any reductions  cancellations or deferrals in customer orders would negatively impact us 
we market and sell our products primarily through an indirect channel comprised of third party resellers not under our control 
we believe that our ability to sell products to systems integrators and oems will continue to be important to our success 
however  our relationships with these partners are generally not exclusive  and we cannot control the timing or amount of their procurement or marketing of our products 
some systems integrators and oems who sell our products also sell products of our competitors 
if they choose to promote competing products or simply fail to market our products successfully  our revenue could decrease 
as we enter new geographic and applications markets  we must locate and establish relationships with systems integrators and oems to assist us in building sales in those markets 
because of product integration expenses and the large amount of training required  significant time and resources may be required to establish a profitable relationship with a systems integrator or oem 
we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining an effective relationship with new systems integrators or oems  which would adversely affect our business 
our acquisitions of mobilerobots and inmotx and any future acquisitions may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 
in fiscal and  respectively  we acquired mobilerobots and inmotx  and we may acquire other businesses and technologies to further our strategic objectives 
we had no prior experience with the autonomous robot and automated guided vehicle technologies market of mobilerobots and our gripping technology of the softpic products provide a new focus to our food packaging business 
we are unable to predict the market acceptance of these additions 
our acquisitions present risks  including significant expenditures of cash and dilutive stock issuances  difficulties in integrating the product offerings  operations  or workforce  difficulties in establishing and maintaining effective uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  the loss of key personnel or customers from either our current business or the acquired company s business  adverse effects on existing relationships with suppliers  disruptions of our on going businesses and diversion of our existing resources  difficulties in realizing our financial and strategic objectives of the acquired business  negative impact on results of operations due to goodwill impairment write offs  amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill  or assumption of anticipated liabilities  risks of entering new markets in which we have limited or no previous experience  entering geographic areas or distribution channels with no prior experience  assumption of unanticipated liabilities  such as problems with the quality of the acquired company s product  and 
table of contents diversion of management attention 
the risks above could significantly harm our business 
the failure to successfully evaluate and execute acquisitions or adequately address these risks could materially harm our financial results 
our products could have unknown defects which may give rise to claims against us  increase our expenses  or harm our reputation 
our products are complex and despite testing  our products or enhancements may contain defects  errors or performance problems 
any defects or errors could result in expensive and time consuming design modifications or warranty charges  harmed customer relationships  and loss of market share 
newly released products which have not seen as much use and testing in the marketplace as older product lines can be more susceptible to undetected defects 
as we aim to generate increasing amounts of revenue from sales of recently released products  the negative impact on our business resulting from defects in such products could be significant 
the existence of any defects  errors  or failures in our products could also lead to product liability claims against us  our channel partners  or against our customers 
although we maintain product liability insurance  the coverage limits of these policies may not be adequate to cover future claims 
any claim could result in significant legal defense costs  divert resources  harm our reputation  and negatively impact us 
our failure to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology may impair our competitive advantage 
our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology and trade secrets 
we primarily rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret protection  licenses  and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights  but have not always sought patent  registration  or similar protection on our technology where it may have been available 
the steps we have taken may not be sufficient to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property or to provide us with any commercial advantage 
the process of obtaining patent protection can be time consuming and costly  and our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to uncertainty and litigation risks 
we may face costly intellectual property infringement claims 
allegations of intellectual property infringement by our products may arise and could include claims against us  our manufacturers  our suppliers  or even our customers 
because there are numerous patents in the automation industry  it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes intellectual property rights 
as a result  we may be forced to respond to intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights 
regardless of merit  these claims could consume management time  result in costly litigation  or cause product shipment delays 
in settling these claims  we may be required to cease selling products or services  pay damages  redesign the challenged technology  or enter into unfavorable royalty or licensing agreements 
any of these could seriously harm our business 
our investments in certain new markets subject us to increased regulation and potential product liability  and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in these markets or that risks related to these industries will not have an adverse effect on our business 
our systems and controls are sold in a variety of industries  including solar  packaging and medical  among others 
our penetration of the packaging market for food and certain other regulated items where we see potential revenue growth also requires additional costs to fulfill necessary certification and compliance processes 
we have increased our strategic focus on sales for certain applications that are highly regulated  including the automation of repetitive operations in diagnostic and pharmaceutical labs 
as we start to engage in certain activities in the medical industry  we must ensure that our products and systems comply with various regulatory requirements relevant to medical applications 
this will increase costs necessary to operate our business  and our failure to comply with these requirements could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or subject us to regulatory actions or fines 
our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could harm our business 
we are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  handling  and disposal of hazardous substances used in the manufacturing and assembly of our products 
we believe that we are in compliance with material environmental regulations and have all necessary environmental permits 
however  our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in penalties or liabilities  and could curtail our operations 
our success depends on our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified personnel 
our inability to attract  train  motivate  and retain qualified management  sales  and technical personnel could adversely affect our ability to design  manufacture  market  sell our support and our products  and to meet our requirements as a public company 
many companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater resources than we do 
in addition  in making employment decisions in the technology industry  job candidates often consider the value of the equity they receive in connection with their employment 
therefore  volatility in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or 
table of contents retain technical personnel  which could harm our business 
if we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
under the sarbanes oxley act  our management must establish  maintain and make certain assessments and certifications regarding our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting 
we have dedicated significant resources to our efforts to comply with these requirements  including significant actions to develop  evaluate  and test our internal controls but cannot provide absolute assurances 
a failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in inaccurate or late reporting of our financial results  an investigation by regulatory authorities  a loss of investor confidence  a decrease in the trading price of our common stock and could expose us to costly litigation or regulatory proceedings 
our restructuring efforts may not be effective  might have unintended consequences  and could negatively impact our business 
from time to time  we have restructured our operations in response to changes in the economic environment  our industry and demand 
to lower our operating costs during fiscal  we implemented organizational improvements designed to reduce our ongoing costs  which included office consolidation  reorganization and streamlining of our north american operations  and incurred related restructuring expenses 
during fiscal  we consolidated our denmark operations from our inmotx acquisition into our existing facilities and operations  for which we have incurred restructuring expenses in fiscal despite our efforts to structure the company and business to operate in a cost effective manner while adequately facing competitive pressures and fulfilling customer needs  some cost cutting measures could have unexpected negative consequences 
while our restructuring efforts reduced our costs  we cannot be certain that all restructuring efforts will be successful  or that we will not be required to implement additional restructuring activities in the future 
if we are unable to structure our operations effectively or if we face costly termination claims  our operations and prospects could be harmed 
our preferred stock and the concentration of our equity ownership among few stockholders could adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our securities  and may permit a few stockholders to influence the results of stockholder decisions 
we have approximately  shares of common stock and  shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding as of september  a small number of holders beneficially own the substantial majority of our outstanding equity 
these securities are generally freely tradable or subject to registration statements  or in the case of our preferred stock  registration obligations of the company to be completed in fiscal  permitting their sale with little or no restriction 
the potential sale of these securities creates meaningful overhang on the market for our securities and sales by any of these large holders would increase the current volatility of our common stock  the market price of which is affected by our low trading volume 
this may affect the trading market for our stock  and could control the results of matters requiring stockholder approval  which may delay or prevent a change of control or negatively affect our stock price 
as further discussed below  our recently issued preferred stock is convertible into common stock at any time by the holder and provides other rights of the holders to approve certain matters  including additional indebtedness  liens  dilutive or senior securities issuance or extraordinary transactions 
these approval rights could delay or prevent a change of control or other corporate actions and negatively affect our stock price 
stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our common stock may be depressed by future issuances of additional shares of our equity securities 
we issued  shares of our common stock in a public offering in june and issued  shares of preferred stock convertible into common stock at a conversion rate in september from time to time  we may issue additional common or preferred stock or other equity securities for various reasons  including to finance our operations  to fund acquisitions or to hire or retain employees 
any issuances of our equity securities  or the perception that such issuances may occur  could dilute the interests of our stockholders and have a material negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources below 
the rights and preferences of the preferred stock may decrease the perceived value  and thus the trading price  of our common stock 
furthermore  the preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or satisfaction of certain conditions  and the issuance of common stock upon such conversion could require us to issue a significant number of shares of our common stock and result in significant dilution to existing stockholders 
at june   options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock were outstanding under our equity compensation plans  and approximately an additional  shares of common stock were reserved for future grant and issuance under such plans 
we can also issue shares under our employee stock purchase plan  which had approximately  shares available for issuance at june  shares of common stock issued under these plans are generally freely tradable in the public market  subject to certain limitations applicable to our affiliates 
option exercises and employee stock purchase plan 
table of contents purchases could increase the number of common shares outstanding and could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock  due to our low trading volume 
prior to fiscal  we have also issued more than million shares of common stock of which  were forfeitured by the holders thereof in connection with our acquisitions of mobilerobots and inmotx 
our use of equity to raise additional financing or as consideration in connection with a future acquisition or other transaction could also result in the dilution of our stockholders equity interest 
our stock price may fluctuate widely  making resale of our common stock difficult 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially 
our stock price may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to factors including fluctuations in operating results  our liquidity needs and constraints  the effectiveness of cost control measures  changes in our business focus and operational organization  our restructuring activities and changes in management and other personnel  our limited public float and the limited trading volume of our common stock on nasdaq  the business environment  including the operating results and stock prices of companies in the industries we serve  general conditions in the intelligent automation and packaging industries  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing by us or our competitors  litigation or claims relating to the volatility of our common stock  internal controls  proprietary rights or other matters  developments in the financial markets  and perceived dilution from stock issuances in financing or acquisition transactions

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we provide intelligent robotics systems  the core of which are our motion controls systems  integrated vision guidance technology and application software  which are sold in combination with our own proprietary robot mechanisms 
our vision guidance technology is tightly integrated with our motion controls technology  and this is a key differentiator for adept 
our two most recent acquisitions have provided autonomous robot and fleet management capabilities that enhance our offerings for target markets  as well as unique gripping technology that expands our reach into the global food processing market 
in addition  we provide a full complement of robotics services and support for our customers 
through sales to systems integrators  oem partners and end user companies  we sell our robotics systems and services into a few broad industries where we believe we can provide the best solutions for particular applications 
we operate in two segments robotics and services and support 
acquisitions on january   we acquired inmotx  inc inmotx  a danish privately held provider of robotic platform solutions and gripping technology for the global food processing market 
pursuant to a merger agreement dated january   we paid million in cash  and issued  shares of our common stock to inmotx shareholders 
all of these shares were made subject to a holdback arrangement to secure the inmotx shareholder indemnity obligations for an eighteen month period 
we also issued  shares of our common stock to the inmotx chief technology officer  to vest on the third anniversary of the merger  contingent upon his continued employment by adept or a subsidiary  subject to certain exceptions for disability  termination without cause or termination for good reason or a change of control 
on september   the inmotx chief technology officer entered into a separation agreement with the company to terminate employment on january  of the  share grant issued upon the merger   shares were forfeited as of september   and the remaining  shares vested on june  in the third quarter of fiscal  we agreed upon indemnification amounts of  due from the former shareholders of inmotx relating to customer claims for matters arising prior to the acquisition by adept 
of the  shares issued on the merger date for the acquisition of inmotx   shares were forfeited by the holders and returned to adept in the fourth quarter of fiscal we also agreed to make certain contingent annual payments in cash to the former inmotx shareholders and to the chief technology officer in an amount equal to ten percent and two percent  respectively  of the revenues inmotx achieves in excess of specified thresholds during the three annual periods following the merger date  the fair value of which at june  was the results of inmotx s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since january  in october  we announced the decision to consolidate the inmotx operations in denmark into our pleasanton  california operations 
consolidation activities began during the second quarter of fiscal  and were completed by june  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of inmotx 
on june   we acquired mobilerobots inc mobilerobots  a privately held provider of autonomous robot and automated guided vehicle technologies based in new hampshire  pursuant to a merger agreement dated june   under which we paid approximately million in cash and issued  shares of our common stock 
we also agreed to pay bonus amounts in cash up to an aggregate  to employees of mobilerobots after fiscal if certain mobilerobots product revenue targets were met for fiscal mobilerobots fiscal revenues met the minimum revenue threshold defined in the merger agreement  and a bonus of  was paid in the first quarter of fiscal the results of mobilerobots operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since june  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of mobilerobots 
strategy our strategy focuses on a few specific industries where the use of automation is currently fast growing or is expected to grow over the long term and where we can provide significant product differentiation 
this strategy reflects our belief that new opportunities exist in the expansion of application level solutions in vertical markets  where automation has been largely nonexistent or extremely inflexible 
the industries we have targeted are medical  logistics  clean tech markets and packaging 
currently  we are focusing the majority of our investments on our mobilerobots technology and packaging solutions applications 
we are investing significantly in the mobilerobots technology to take advantage of emerging opportunities in the clean tech  logistics  and healthcare markets as it pertains to the lean movement of goods 
for example  in the medical industry we have formed a partnership to be the exclusive provider of autonomous mobile robots to swisslog healthcare solutions for use in hospitals  labs and clinics to transport specimens  lab samples and pharmaceuticals  and in february  we launched the new adept courier  a small autonomous vehicle that simplifies the everyday task of moving goods  materials  samples  or 
table of contents parts around an office or production environment 
since most logistics problems require a fleet of robots combined with our new enterprise fleet manager to effectively solve  we believe our unique mobile robot technology has tremendous long term potential across a wide range of industries  and we believe this business will be characterized by larger average order sizes and better visibility than our traditional businesses 
the packaging market has continued to provide new applications even during the last few years of worldwide economic weakness and reflects the strength of our quattro robot in this industry 
we believe our acquisition of inmotx in january further strengthens our offerings for the packaging market  as inmotx brings differentiated technology for global food processing applications 
we believe the natural foods market is a largely untapped automation market  and the packaging solutions technology we acquired from inmotx is an enabler for these applications 
the packaging solutions technology also brings changes to our standard business model  as order sizes of these packaging cells are typically larger than our normal component sales  revenues are received in installments over the project term and deferred until recognizable  and each cell includes high margin consumable grippers which must be replaced periodically over the life of the cell  generating a secondary revenue stream 
in the solar market  we have achieved new design wins with solar cell manufacturers that we believe will provide long term opportunity for us as these manufacturers begin to equip their automation capabilities and ramp up their production operations 
we hope to capitalize on the growing opportunities for automation in china as a rapidly developing market for industrial robots over the long term with our new sales and service office in shanghai  which opened near the end of fiscal this office will allow us more visible access and support to our growing customer base in the region 
additionally  we continue to address our sales efforts towards our traditional markets  such as the german automotive electronics and industrial markets  where our products are well positioned  demand is strengthening and we believe significant long term opportunity exists 
included in our growth strategy is an ongoing search for possible businesses  product lines or technologies for partnership or collaboration 
our focus is on pursuing partnerships that would broaden our solutions capabilities  further strengthen our position in key markets  increase our revenues and expand our operational scale 
our long term strategy is to grow our new mobilerobots and packaging solutions initiatives to enable these businesses to achieve of our total revenues  while improving our gross margin to exceed and increase net margins over time in parallel with our growth efforts 
trends in our business during fiscal  our revenues grew compared with the previous year  driven primarily by stronger demand from some of our traditional markets  including the automotive and industrial markets in germany  the consumer electronics market in asia  and the consumer goods market in europe 
revenues were also favorably impacted by growth in our commercial mobilerobots material handling applications and in the medical and pharmaceutical industries 
we are encouraged by our performance in our target markets and by the signs of returning demand from our traditional industries in fiscal however  this recent encouragement is tempered by the current economic condition worldwide  and we are cautious as to the outlook in the next few fiscal quarters 
sales growth in fiscal was enhanced by marginal growth in the international disk drive market  as this industry showed signs of recovering from the cyclical downturn it entered into during the second quarter of fiscal while it is difficult to predict the timing of investment cycles within the disk drive industry  based on information from our customers  we believe this market will return to a minimal capital investment growth period in the near term 
we believe that our acquisition of inmotx will help drive future growth in the packaging market over the long term  as the gripping technology that inmotx brings provides a unique advantage in certain markets  particularly hygienic packaging for the natural foods market 
we believe the positive growth in packaging experienced during fiscal will continue to build primarily in the us over the long term  packaging presents both a large opportunity and the potential to substantially effect our financial model  as the average order size and visibility is better than our traditional components business 
these characteristics  along with the consumables and service revenues to the company  have potential to result in more consistent  sustainable revenues over the long term 
on a geographic basis  our us sales increased in fiscal compared with the prior year and accounted for of total revenue in fiscal compared to in the previous year 
this growth reflects increased sales of our commercial mobilerobots material handling applications  primarily in the medical and pharmaceutical industries  and increased sales in the packaging markets 
these increases were partially offset by decreased demand in our domestic disk drive markets 
we believe the mobilerobots and packaging solutions products will comprise an increasing portion of our us business over time  as our new mobilerobots technology has enabled us to address new opportunities in material handling applications in the medical  semiconductor and industrial markets  and our new gripper technology acquired from inmotx has enabled us to expand our opportunities in the packaging solutions markets 
in asia  higher sales from the disk drive markets in fiscal were partially offset by lower packaging and solar sales  
table of contents resulting in a revenue increase compared to the prior year and accounted for of total revenues in fiscal compared to in the previous year 
though the disk drive industry showed gains during the year which may continue  we remain cautious due to the cyclical nature of the industry and are actively pursuing opportunities in asia outside of the disk drive markets 
we believe that the clean tech and logistics markets in asia present us with significant long term opportunities 
european sales grew in fiscal compared with the previous year and accounted for of total revenues for fiscal compared to in the previous year 
the european growth was primarily the result of higher sales to the traditional automotive and industrial markets  particularly in germany  and higher sales to the consumer goods market 
this growth was partially offset by lower sales to the packaging market  and lower demand for replacement parts 
much of the demand for our products in the last few years has come from europe and we believe the region will continue to be an important long term market for our products  both in traditional sectors such as automotive  electronics and industrial  and in our target growth markets  including packaging and solar 
restructuring and cost reduction actions operationally  from time to time we have undertaken restructuring and other cost reduction actions to support our financial model  which emphasizes cost efficiency balanced with investments in our products and revenue generating activities 
we remain committed to managing our business to generate cash 
in october  we announced the decision to consolidate the inmotx operations in denmark into the company s pleasanton  california operations 
consolidation activities began during the second quarter of fiscal  and were completed by june  during fiscal  we incurred million in restructuring charges  which includes  of stock based compensation  related to the consolidation of the inmotx operations 
during the second half of fiscal  we implemented organizational improvements designed to reduce our ongoing costs  which included office consolidation  reorganization within our sales infrastructure and a general streamlining of our business operations in the americas region  and incurred  in related restructuring expenses  of which  was accelerated stock based compensation expense 
summary of the fiscal fourth quarter revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal were million  up from million for the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of higher disk drive revenues primarily in malaysia 
the increase in disk drive sales was partially offset by decreased revenues in our solar and semiconductor markets in europe 
gross margin was of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared with of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal gross margin in the fiscal fourth quarter was unfavorably impacted by a lower margin product mix including higher disk drive sales and an unfavorable euro exchange rate 
operating expenses were million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a decrease of compared with million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease primarily resulted from lower expenses for inmotx in the current quarter compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as increased streamlining of our operating costs and efficiencies 
operating loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal was  compared to an operating loss of million for the fourth quarter of fiscal net loss for the fiscal fourth quarter was  or net loss per share  compared to a net loss of  or net loss per share  for the fourth quarter of fiscal results of operations this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and cash flow during the two year period ended june   each year therein referred to as fiscal and  reflecting requirements applicable to adept as a smaller reporting company

robotics segment revenues were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal higher robotics revenues in fiscal were primarily the result of higher demand from the automotive and industrial markets  primarily in germany  which increased million or from  increased sales of our commercial mobilerobots material handling applications  which increased million from  in  primarily in the united states  canada  and singapore  increased sales of consumer goods  primarily in europe  which increased million  or from  and increased sales to the medical and pharmaceutical markets  primarily in germany  which increased million  or from revenues in our services and support segment were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal the decrease during fiscal was primarily due to decreased demand for replacement parts worldwide  which decreased million  or  from the following table sets forth our annual revenues and year to year change in revenues by geographic region for the fiscal years ended june  and in thousands  except for percentages fiscal change to fiscal revenue by geography united states revenues percentage of total revenues europe revenues percentage of total revenues asia revenues percentage of total revenues other countries revenues percentage of total revenues total international revenues percentage of total revenues total revenues our domestic revenues were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal this increase reflects increased sales of our commercial mobilerobots material handling applications  which increased million from  in  primarily in the medical and pharmaceutical industries  and increased sales in the packaging markets  which increased million  or  from these increases were partially offset by decreased demand in our domestic disk drive markets  which decreased million  or  from our international revenues were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal this increase resulted from a increase in sales in our european markets  a increase in our asian markets  and a increase in sales to all other international countries 

table of contents european sales in fiscal increased to million  compared with million in fiscal this increase was primarily a result of an increase in demand from the automotive and industrial markets  primarily in germany  which increased million  or  and a million  or  increase in sales to the consumer goods industries  primarily in spain and germany 
these increases were partially offset by a million  or  decrease in sales to the packaging markets  primarily in germany  a million  or  decrease in sales to the replacement parts markets  primarily in france  and a million  or  decrease in sales to the other miscellaneous markets  primarily in france 
revenues from asia in fiscal increased to million compared with million in fiscal as a result of an increase of million  or  in sales to the disk drive markets  primarily in malaysia 
revenues from other countries remained a relatively small percentage of our sales in fiscal however  compared to fiscal  revenues from other countries have experienced significant growth 
revenues in fiscal increased to million  compared with million in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of increased sales of our commercial mobilerobots material handling applications  which increased to  from zero in fiscal  increased sales to the packaging markets  primarily in canada  which increased  or  from fiscal  and increased sales to the medical and pharmaceutical industries  primarily in canada  which increased  or  from fiscal backlog 
our product backlog at june  was approximately million compared to approximately million at june  the decrease in backlog at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal is due to a slowdown seen in customer order patterns at the end of fiscal  especially in europe 
orders with delivery dates beyond twelve months from the end of the fiscal quarter are not included in backlog  and thus we expect substantially all backlog at june  to ship during fiscal because orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules and in certain instances may be subject to cancellation without significant penalty to the customer  our backlog at any date may not be indicative of demand for our products or actual revenues for any period in the future 
gross margin the following table sets forth our gross margin and year to year change in gross margin for the fiscal years ended june  and in thousands  except for percentages fiscal change to fiscal revenues gross margin gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal gross margin in fiscal was unfavorably affected by a more unfavorable mix of sales to lower margin asian markets and due to the weakening of the euro to the us dollar exchange rate 
gross margin in fiscal was favorably affected by a more favorable mix of sales to higher margin european markets and due to the strengthening of the euro to the us dollar exchange rate 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our gross margin percentage from period to period due to changes in volume  changes in availability of components  changes in product configuration  increased price based competition  changes in sales mix of products and or changes in operating costs 
in particular  we expect that sales into the disk drive market will continue to have a negative impact on gross margin  while packaging and mobile sales will have a positive effect 
in addition  we expect that changes in currency valuations will continue to impact gross margin  as a significant portion of our revenues are in euro and a portion of our components are paid for in japanese yen 
operating expenses research  development and engineering the following table sets forth our research  development and engineering expenses and year to year change in these expenses for the fiscal years ended june  and in thousands  except for percentages 
table of contents fiscal change to fiscal expenses percentage of revenue research  development and engineering r d costs are expensed as incurred  with the exception of software development costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility and up to the general release of the software products that are capitalized 
technological feasibility is demonstrated by the completion of a working model or a detailed program design 
capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over either two or three years  whichever term is the estimated life of the software product 
r d expenses in fiscal were million  or of revenues  an increase of from million  or of revenues  in fiscal higher r d expenses in fiscal compared with the prior year  primarily resulted from the increased investment in our commercial mobilerobots material handling applications and packaging solutions applications 
we expect that quarterly r d expenses in fiscal will remain steady from fiscal fourth quarter levels of million due to the closing of the denmark entity and streamlining of expenses offset by investment in our new products 
we have also implemented a temporary salary reduction for our employees to reduce our operating expenses in the first fiscal quarter of to offset the slowdown seen in orders during this time 
this reduction will be reevaluated in the second fiscal quarter of to determine if it is still necessary 
adept capitalized  of software costs in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal we expect our capitalized software costs to decrease substantially in fiscal due to a release of a software product during the first fiscal quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following table sets forth our selling  general and administrative expenses and year to year change in these expenses for the fiscal years ended june  and in thousands  except for percentages fiscal change to fiscal expenses percentage of revenue selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of employee compensation  professional fees arising from legal  auditing and other consulting services  as well as tradeshow participation and other marketing costs 
sg a expenses were million  or of revenues  in fiscal  down from million  or of revenues  in fiscal lower sg a expenses in fiscal compared with the prior year primarily resulted from lower stock based compensation expense in fiscal stock based compensation expense was higher in fiscal due to the acquisitions of mobilerobots and inmotx 
we expect that quarterly fixed sg a expenses will decrease slightly during fiscal from the million recorded in the fourth quarter of  reflecting continued streamlining of our overhead costs and processes 
we have also implemented a temporary salary reduction for our employees to reduce our operating expenses in the first fiscal quarter to offset the slowdown seen in orders during this time 
this reduction will be reevaluated in the second fiscal quarter of to determine if it is still necessary 
amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization expense totaled  during fiscal and  during fiscal for the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the mobilerobots acquisition in the fourth quarter of and the inmotx acquisition in the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal stock based compensation expense 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of million in fiscal and million in fiscal for our stock option plans  employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock grants 
stock based compensation expense in fiscal and includes  and  respectively  of accelerated stock based compensation expense related to employee terminations that were part of our restructuring activities  and has been classified as restructuring expense 
excluding the restructuring related expense  the remaining decrease is primarily due to the restricted stock issued in connection with our acquisition of mobilerobots and inmotx  and the fiscal grants and vesting of 
table of contents restricted stock based upon the level of performance for fiscal performance plan awards in fiscal which did not reoccur in fiscal we did not record an income tax benefit for stock based compensation expense in any of the periods presented because of the extent of our net operating loss carry forwards 
in fiscal  we expect stock based compensation expense to increase slightly from fiscal levels due to grants and vesting of restricted stock granted under our fiscal performance plan awards offset by the near completion of vesting related to our acquisitions of mobilerobots and inmotx 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our recognition of stock based compensation expense 
restructuring charges 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to the consolidation of the inmotx operations in denmark into the company s pleasanton  california operations 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of  related to office consolidation  sales reorganization and business streamlining measures implemented during the second half of the fiscal year  which included  in accelerated stock based compensation expense due to vesting and release of restricted stock in connection with employee terminations 
operating loss 
we recorded an operating loss of million in fiscal  compared with an operating loss of million in fiscal lower operating losses recorded in the fiscal periods were primarily the result of lower stock based compensation expenses and cost cutting measures employed company wide 
interest income expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  was  in fiscal  compared with  in fiscal the increase in interest expense during fiscal primarily resulted from a higher line of credit balance through fiscal  which included borrowings throughout fiscal to fund operations  as well as borrowings in the third quarter of fiscal to finance our acquisition of inmotx 
foreign currency exchange gain loss 
our foreign subsidiaries balance sheet accounts are translated at current period ending exchange rates and statements of operations accounts are translated at the average rate for the period 
translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
foreign currency transaction losses were  in fiscal and  in fiscal the foreign currency transaction losses recorded in fiscal were primarily generated from realized losses related to the payments of intercompany payables in us dollars by the european entities 
as the euro decreased against the us dollar  more euros were needed to purchase the us dollar to settle the payable 
the foreign currency transaction losses recorded in fiscal year were primarily generated from realized losses from us dollars used to pay accounts payable in japanese yen  as the yen strengthened against the us dollar during the period  and losses related to the payments of intercompany payables in us dollar by the european entities 
as we conduct business on a global basis we are continually exposed to adverse or beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates  which can vary considerably from period to period 
the dollar euro and the dollar yen markets currently present the largest exchange rate risk for adept 
provision benefit for income taxes 
adept typically provides for income taxes during interim reporting periods based upon an estimate of our annual effective tax rate 
we also maintain a liability to cover the cost of additional tax exposure items on the filing of federal and state income tax returns as well as filings in foreign jurisdictions 
each of these filing jurisdictions may audit the tax returns filed and propose adjustments 
adjustments arise from a variety of factors  including different interpretations of statutes and regulations 
we recorded a tax benefit of  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal for fiscal  the tax benefit represents a release of  in reserves related to our asc analysis 
this release was due to expired statutes of limitations in france and germany and net operating loss true ups in germany offset by a provision of  representing state minimum tax requirements as well as foreign tax expense 
for fiscal  the tax benefit represents state minimum tax requirements as well as a foreign tax expense adjustment primarily related to our singapore operations 
we have net operating losses that are sufficient to offset a significant portion of our domestic and foreign tax obligations  except when annual net operating loss limitations exist for domestic and foreign jurisdictions that result in some tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources changes in the company s liquidity during and since the year ended june  primarily reflect the net effect of cash used by operations  cash provided from common stock issued in connection with a public offering  borrowings from the company s line of credit and capital expenditures 
since the end of fiscal  adept also completed an million private placement of preferred stock as further discussed below 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents were million at june  in fiscal year  cash increased by  changes in liquidity include proceeds from common stock of million and borrowings from our line of credit for million offset by operational losses of million and by purchases of property and equipment of million net cash used in operations was million  primarily resulting from the net cash loss from operations of million and an increase of million in net accounts receivable due primarily to the increase in sales 
in fiscal year  the company used million of cash in investing activities  including million for purchases of property and equipment  and  in stock forfeited by the inmotx shareholders as indemnification for adept s cash outlays for claims for matters arising prior to the acquisition by adept  offset by  in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
in fiscal year  cash provided from financing activities of million primarily consisted of the million proceeds from a stock offering in the fourth quarter  and million draw on the company s line of credit 
on september   the company issued  shares of the company s preferred stock  par value per share the preferred stock  at a price of  per share to hale capital partners  lp hale capital 
the company received net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of the preferred stock  after deducting estimated expenses payable by the company 
holders of preferred stock will be entitled to receive dividends payable quarterly in arrears payable  at the election of the company either in cash or  subject to certain equity conditions  in common stock 
dividends on the preferred stock will accrue at prime rate wall street journal eastern edition plus up to a maximum amount of 
each share of the preferred stock will be convertible  at the option of the holder and upon certain mandatory conversion events described below  at a conversion rate of 
if on or after the first anniversary of the issuance of the preferred stock  the common stock price exceeds the applicable percentage meaning  from the first anniversary to the second anniversary  until the third anniversary  and thereafter for a consecutive days  such price is maintained until conversion  and certain equity conditions providing that such shares of common stock issued upon conversion can be immediately saleable by the holders the equity conditions  the company can convert the preferred stock up to an amount equal to the greater of the then one week trading volume of the common stock the volume limit or the amount of an identified bona fide block trade at a price not less than the then current market price 
starting months after issuance of the preferred stock  if the trading price of the common stock is more than of the conversion price for a specified period  the company may convert up to of the preferred stock issued pursuant to the securities purchase agreement per quarter at of the original price plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends  subject to a maximum conversion equal to the volume limit per month and subject to the equity conditions 
the ability to require conversion requires that the company i maintains on deposit such amount of cash and cash equivalents and ii satisfies such ebitda threshold  in each case as is mutually determined by the company and silicon valley bank and reasonably acceptable to hale capital 
if the company cannot convert the preferred stock due to its failure to satisfy the conditions  then it may redeem the shares for cash at the same price subject to agreement of the holder 
upon certain triggering events  such as bankruptcy  insolvency or a material adverse effect or failure of the company to issue shares upon conversion of the preferred stock in accordance with its obligations  the holders may require the company to redeem all or some of the preferred stock at a price equal to of the conversion amount  and in certain events  the higher trading price of the common stock underlying the preferred stock between the date of the redemption notice and redemption  plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
on or after september   each holder can require the company to redeem its preferred stock in cash at a price equal to of the conversion amount being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
silicon valley bank line of credit we have a revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank  or svb 
we originally entered into the loan and security agreement and related agreements for the revolving line in may in march  we entered into an additional loan and security agreement ex im loan facility and related agreements with svb  pursuant to which a portion of the revolving line the ex im line is guaranteed by the export import bank of the united states  and adept is able to borrow against foreign accounts receivable and export related inventory 
in february  we entered into amendments to the may loan and security agreement as previously amended  the march loan and security agreement ex im loan facility and related agreements 
in september  we entered into further amendments to the may loan and security agreement 

table of contents the revolving line of credit including the ex im line matures on march  all borrowings bear interest at the prime rate announced from time to time by svb plus 
our maximum aggregate borrowing availability under the revolving line of credit is million 
we may borrow up to the lesser of million or of our eligible domestic accounts receivable  and up to the lesser of million or the borrowing base calculated by applying specified advance rates to our eligible foreign accounts receivable and inventory destined for export from the united states 
the loan documents specify the criteria for determining eligible domestic and foreign accounts receivable and eligible inventory destined for export 
our available borrowing base under the revolving line is reduced by the principal balance of outstanding advances under the domestic portion of the revolving line and the ex im line 
our ability to make borrowings under the revolving line is subject to ongoing conditions precedent that our representations and warranties in the loan documents are true  in all material respects  on the date on which we request the borrowing and on the funding date  and that svb determines  in its sole discretion  that there has been no material impairment in our business  results of operation  financial condition  or the prospect of repayment of our obligations to svb  or any material adverse deviation from our most recent business plan submitted to svb 
adept and certain subsidiaries have granted svb a security interest in substantially all of their respective assets including certain shares of subsidiaries to secure the obligations outstanding under the revolving line  and under any separate bank service agreements that may be entered into by adept and svb covering foreign exchange contracts  cash management services or letters of credit 
we must meet certain financial covenants under the loan documents 
as amended in september  the loan documents require us to maintain a liquidity domestic cash plus the available domestic borrowing base  measured monthly of at least million  and b minimum aggregate rolling six month ebitda measured at the end of each fiscal quarter for the six months ending on such date and applying a definition of ebitda specified in the loan and security agreement equal to or exceeding specified amounts for each quarter 
these quarterly ebitda amounts are minimum amounts for financial covenant purposes only  and do not represent projections of adept s financial results 
we also must remain in compliance with various other covenants 
for example  we must maintain our primary operating deposit accounts with svb  and require our us customers to transmit payments to a lockbox account at svb 
during the second quarter of  svb began to first apply collections from the lockbox account toward repayment of our obligations to svb  and then transfer any excess to adept s designated deposit account with svb a payment mechanism commonly referred to as dominion mode 
in february  the loan documents were amended to perpetuate dominion mode and remove the threshold that previously triggered it 
one of the september amendments reinstitutes a new threshold so that adept is no longer automatically in dominion mode 
under this amendment  if our liquidity domestic cash plus the available domestic borrowing base is million or above and there is no event of default under the revolving line  svb will transfer all collections from the lockbox account to our designated deposit account 
if adept s liquidity falls below million  adept will be in dominion mode and svb will apply all collections from the lockbox account first toward repayment of our obligations to svb  with any excess transferred to our designated deposit account 
while in dominion mode  we may continue to borrow funds under the revolving line if there is available borrowing base to do so  and we meet the other conditions precedent for borrowing set forth in the loan documents 
we may not permit or suffer any specified change in control  including any change in the beneficial ownership of or more or or more  in the case of shares held by one specified stockholder group of adept s outstanding shares  without svb s consent 
various other covenants restrict the manner in which we conduct our business  our ability to pay dividends  incur additional indebtedness or encumber our assets  the types of transactions including mergers and acquisitions we may enter into and our ability to transfer funds to subsidiaries 
a september amendment to the loan documents modified certain covenants in the revolving line to permit adept to meet dividend payment and mandatory redemption provisions under the terms  rights  obligations and preferences of the preferred stock we issued to hale capital 
this amendment also requires svb consent before we can make certain specified types of changes to the terms  rights  obligations and preferences of the preferred stock 
adept became subject to additional covenants related to permissible use of proceeds and other matters in the loan documents for the ex im line 
adept would be deemed to be in default under the loan documents if we failed to timely pay any amount owed to svb  if we failed to comply with specified financial and other covenants  including those listed above  if we otherwise materially breached  without cure  any of our representations under or other provisions in the loan documents  if there occurs a material adverse change in our or any guarantor subsidiary s business  operations or condition  or a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of our obligations to svb  or a material impairment in the perfection or priority of svb s security interests or the value of svb s security interest in our or any guarantor subsidiary s assets  or if svb determines there is a reasonable likelihood that we will not meet our financial covenants in the next succeeding quarter  if any involuntary lien or attachment is issued against adept s or any guarantor subsidiary s assets  or any judgment or order in excess of  is entered against adept or any guarantor subsidiary  that is not discharged  vacated or satisfied within ten days  if adept or any guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent or is generally not paying its debts as they become due  if adept or any guarantor subsidiary makes any material written misrepresentation to svb  if we fail to pay amounts due under or otherwise materially breach any 
table of contents agreements with third parties  or if a default occurs under such agreements which permits indebtedness in excess of  to be accelerated  if breaches occur under agreements related to subordinated debt that may be outstanding during the term of the loan  if there is any revocation or termination of  or nonperformance of any obligation or covenant under  any guaranty of adept s obligations  or if we lose government approvals or become subject to certain governmental actions that could materially adversely affect us 
in addition  if the export import bank s guarantee of the ex im line is declared void or revoked for any reason  whether or not caused by adept s actions  such event may trigger an event of default under the loan documents unless adept is able to repay all outstanding obligations under the ex im line and no other events of default are occurring simultaneously 
upon a default  svb may  among other things  cease making loans to adept  accelerate and declare all or any part of our obligations to be immediately due and payable  and enforce its security interest against the collateral 
adept paid a  fee to svb in september  and will pay certain bank expenses  in connection with entry into the september amendments 
we have agreed to pay a termination fee of  if the revolving line is terminated prior to its maturity date 
we must pay a fee  quarterly in arrears  equal to 
per annum of the average unused portion of the credit line 
during periods when there are outstanding balances of principal and interest under the revolving line  svb is entitled to charge a float charge  payable monthly  in an amount equal to one extra day of interest on each payment received by svb from adept during the month 
a collateral monitoring fee of per month  which was payable every month pursuant to the february amendment  is now payable only if our liquidity falls below million and if there is any principal or interest outstanding under the revolving line of credit during the month 
we also must pay all other bank fees and expenses related to the loan transaction 
we were in compliance with the covenants of the loan documents as of june  at june   we had an outstanding principal balance of million under the revolving line  up from million at the end of fiscal  reflecting net principal repayments from domestic cash receipts and re borrowing for cash management purposes during fiscal based on operating needs  strategic activities and other factors  we may further utilize the line of credit in the future or seek alternative credit or other financing in the future to pursue additional expansion opportunities or make other investments in our growth 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  including capitalized software development costs  of million and million net of depreciation at june  and  respectively  and million and million of goodwill and other intangible assets net of amortization at june  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to warranty obligations  bad debt  inventories  cancellation costs associated with long term commitments  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  service contracts  stock based compensation  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates and judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates  by their nature  are based on judgment and available information 
therefore  actual results could differ from those estimates and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  and it is possible that such changes could occur in the near term 
reclassifications 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior period balances to present the financial statements on a consistent basis with current year presentation 
such reclassifications have not changed previously reported net income loss or stockholders equity 
we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to our consolidated financial statements while considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
these critical accounting policies described below include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  
table of contents warranties  capitalization of software development costs  accounting for income taxes  foreign currency accounting  goodwill and purchased intangible assets  valuation of stock based awards  and commitments and contingencies 
revenue recognition 
we generate revenues primarily from sales of production automation equipment and parts  and to a lesser extent from support and service activities associated with this equipment 
non software product revenue consists primarily of sales of robots  refurbished robots and spare parts 
we recognize non software product revenue when persuasive evidence of a non cancelable arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured  legal title and economic risk is transferred to the customer  and when an economic exchange has taken place 
we use the signed purchase contract or purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
product revenues are normally recognized at the point of shipment from our facilities since title and risk of loss passes to the customers at that time 
customers generally have no right of return other than for product defects covered by our warranty 
adept maintains a warranty liability based on our historical warranty experience and management s best estimate of our warranty liability at each balance sheet date 
there are no acceptance criteria on our standard non software products 
we do not deem the fee to be fixed or determinable where a significant portion of the price is due after our normal payment terms  which are to days from the invoice date 
in recording revenue  management exercises judgment about the collectability of receivables based on a number of factors  including the customer s past payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if we conclude that collection is not reasonably assured  then the revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed  generally upon receipt of payment 
our experience is that we have been able to reliably determine whether collection is reasonably assured 
our robots and controllers have features that are enabled or enhanced through the use of software enabling tools and other software elements  which are embedded within our robot and controller products 
our software enabling tools or other software elements do not operate independently of the robots or controllers  and they are not sold separately and cannot be used without the robots or controllers 
we also sell optional software used to enhance capability of our products 
we believe that the software component of our products is incidental to our products and services taken as a whole 
service and support revenue consists primarily of sales of spare parts and refurbished robots 
service revenue also includes training  consulting and customer support  the latter of which includes all field service activities  ie  maintenance  repairs  system modifications or upgrades 
revenues from training and consulting are recognized at the time the service is performed and the customer has accepted the work 
these revenues are not essential to the product functionality and  therefore  do not bear on the revenue recognition policy for our component products 
deferred revenues represent payments received from customers in advance of the delivery of products and or services  or before the satisfaction of all revenue recognition requirements enumerated above  as well as cases in which we have invoiced the customer but cannot yet recognize the revenue for the same reasons discussed above 
revenue for robot refurbishment relates to adept owned or customer owned refurbished robots and components 
we receive parts returned from customers under warranty contracts  or we purchase surplus used parts available from customers or suppliers 
these parts traditionally have lower cost  and internal analysis indicates that on average  we pay a percentage of the new part cost to acquire these components 
the standard cost for acquired parts is therefore set at such percentage of cost in compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requiring valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market 
by contrast  the cost basis starting point for customer owned refurbished or repaired robots is zero since we do not own the robots 
for all refurbishment and remanufacturing  we track all related costs and activities materials and labor required to bring the robots up to standard using work orders 
this revenue stream is included within our services and support segment 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the customer s ability to pay based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowances for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not request collateral from our customers 
however  we may require customers to make payments in advance of shipment or provide a letter of credit under certain circumstances 
if 
table of contents the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate in the future  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our policy is to record specific allowances against known doubtful accounts 
an additional allowance is also calculated based on of consolidated accounts receivable 
specific allowances are netted out of the respective receivable balances for purposes of calculating this additional allowance 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers and  should the default rate change or the financial positions of our customers change  we may increase this additional allowance percentage 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost or market value 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes  among other factors  a review of component demand requirements  product lifecycle and product development plans  and quality issues 
as a result of this assessment  we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated liquidation value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
manufacturing inventory includes raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
the inventory valuation provisions are based on an excess and obsolete systems report  which captures all obsolete parts and products and all other inventory  which have quantities on hand in excess of one year s projected demand 
individual line item exceptions are identified for either inclusion or exclusion from the inventory valuation provision 
the materials control group and cost accounting function monitor the line item exceptions and make periodic adjustments as necessary 
warranties 
our warranty policy is included in our terms of sale  generally as a two year parts and one year labor limited warranty on most hardware and component products  and states that there are no rights of return  and that a refund may be made at our discretion  and only if there is an identified fault in the product and the customer has complied with our approved maintenance schedules and procedures  and the product has not been subject to abuse 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and costs per claim for repair or replacement 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our components suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service labor and delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  service labor or delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
capitalization of software development costs 
we capitalize certain software development costs 
we begin capitalizing software development costs upon the establishment of technological feasibility  which is established upon the completion of a working model or a detailed program design 
costs incurred prior to technological feasibility are charged to expense as incurred 
capitalization ceases when the product is considered available for general release to customers 
capitalized software development costs are amortized to costs of revenues over the estimated economic lives of the software products based on product life expectancy 
generally  estimated economic lives of the software products do not exceed three years 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to compute income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  and assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
in assessing the valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income 
our net deferred tax assets relate predominantly to our united states tax jurisdiction 
we currently maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was determined using an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
our us loss  among other considerations  provides negative evidence and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 
we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions  including related interest  is adequate 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and 
table of contents therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision  net income and cash flows 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to record additional income tax expense or establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
foreign currency accounting 
each of our non us subsidiaries uses its respective local currency as the functional currency 
our foreign subsidiaries balance sheet accounts are translated at current period ending exchange rates and statements of operations accounts are translated at the average rate for the period 
translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from transactions  including intercompany balances not considered to be a permanent investment  denominated in currencies other than an entity s functional currency are included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we do not currently apply a hedging strategy against our currency positions 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
acquisition related intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their economic lives 
goodwill is measured and tested for impairment on an annual basis as of june  or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends  restructuring actions  lower projections of profitability  or a sustained decline in our market capitalization 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to its net book value  including goodwill 
we have defined our reporting units at the business unit level  one level below our reportable segments 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and forecasted operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
future competitive  market and economic conditions could negatively impact key assumptions including our market capitalization or the carrying value of our net assets which could require us to realize an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets 
a potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value 
the second step of the process is only performed if a potential impairment exists  and it involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets other than goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit and if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill  an impairment exists and is recorded 
we review the carrying values of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as significant decreases in the market price  reductions in demand  lower projections of profitability  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of acquired assets  or significant negative industry or economic trends  indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition 
if this review indicates the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value and the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized by writing down the impaired asset to its fair value  which is typically calculated using i quoted market prices and or ii discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate 
valuation of stock based awards 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period of the individual equity instrument 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  and expected dividends 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes calculation for option grants is based on historical volatility as options on our stock are not traded 
when establishing the expected life assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
commitments and contingencies 
we evaluate potential commitments and contingencies based on their anticipated outcome 
if we determine  after consideration of all known facts and consultation with legal counsel  that a loss related to the potential matter is neither probable or cannot be reasonably estimated as of the date of issuance of our fiscal period end reports  we do not accrue for the potential liability 
if a loss is reasonably possible related to the matter  we will disclose the relevant facts of 
table of contents the matter along with an estimated loss amount or range if such amount or range can be reasonably estimated
