executive overview we are a national specialty retailer of private branded  sophisticated  casual to dressy clothing  intimates  complementary accessories  and other non clothing items operating under the chico s  wh bm  soma intimates and boston proper brand names 
we earn revenues and generate cash through the sale of merchandise in our retail stores  on our various websites and through our call centers  which take orders for all brands 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we successfully completed our acquisition of boston proper  a direct to consumer retailer of distinctive women s apparel and accessories 
we expect that boston proper will be accretive to earnings in the first full year following its acquisition before giving any consideration to potential synergies coming from various corporate activities including marketing  catalog circulation and merchandise sourcing 
in fiscal  net sales increased to billion  the highest in our history  compared to billion in fiscal  and comparable sales increased following an increase in fiscal this represents the third consecutive year of positive comparable sales performance

at the end of fiscal  total inventories were million compared to million at the end of fiscal inventories increased approximately million or over fiscal  primarily reflecting million of inventories related to boston proper  million for year over year new stores and million due to higher average unit costs 
cash flows from operations for fiscal were million compared with million in fiscal with cash and marketable securities at the end of fiscal totaling million compared to million at the end of fiscal future outlook for fiscal  including boston proper s operations  our planning assumptions are net sales increase at a mid teens percentage rate to approximately billion  which includes comparable sales growth at a mid single digit rate  approximately growth in store square footage and approximately million in sales from the rd week  gross margin rate down approximately basis points  selling  general and administrative expense sg a  as a percentage of net sales  down approximately basis points  effective tax rate to be approximately  inventories to be in line with sales growth  and capital expenditures of approximately million  primarily for new stores  dc enhancements and expansion at nssc 
these are our internal planning assumptions and are not intended to be guidance

net sales increased in fiscal the increase reflects a comparable sales increase of as well as new store openings 
the comparable sales increase reflects an approximate increase in transactions at chico s boutique stores  which was partially offset by a slight decrease in units per transaction 
in addition  wh bm stores experienced an increase in both transactions and units per transaction in fiscal the chico s soma intimates brands comparable sales increased following a increase in fiscal and the wh bm brand s comparable sales increased following a increase for fiscal 
table of contents cost of goods sold gross margin the following table depicts cost of goods sold and gross margin in dollars and gross margin as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal cost of goods sold gross margin gross margin percentage for fiscal  gross margin was billion  an increase of  compared to billion in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross margin was which was a basis point decrease from fiscal this decrease primarily reflects higher full price selling and effective promotional activities which were more than offset by higher discounting in the chico s brand in the second half of the year 
for fiscal  gross margin was billion  an increase of  compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross margin was which was a basis point increase from fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to improved merchandise margins at outlet stores due to increased penetration of made for outlet product but offset  for the most part  by a slight decrease in merchandise margins at chico s boutique stores 
this decrease in merchandise margins was primarily driven by increases in markdowns for fiscal  partially offset by slightly higher initial markups for the chico s brand

table of contents provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was  and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for fiscal reflected relatively higher levels of favorable state tax settlements 
liquidity and capital resources overview we believe that our existing cash and marketable securities balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures  working capital needs  dividend payments  potential share repurchases  commitments  and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next months 
furthermore  while it is our intention to repurchase our stock and pay a quarterly cash dividend in the future  any determination to repurchase our stock or pay future dividends will be made by the board of directors and will depend on our stock price  future earnings  financial condition  and other factors established by the board 
our ongoing capital requirements will continue to be primarily for new  expanded  relocated and remodeled stores  our dc and other central support facilities  the planned expansion of our nssc campus  and information technology 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  an increase of approximately million from fiscal primarily due to higher net income and increased accrued and other deferred liabilities partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable leverage 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  an increase of approximately million from fiscal primarily due to higher net income and an increase in accounts payable leverage 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the net change of million primarily reflects the acquisition of boston proper  funding of our share repurchase programs and increased capital expenditures 
the million increase in capital expenditures when compared to fiscal primarily relates to costs associated with new  relocated  remodeled and expanded chico s  soma and wh bm stores 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal in fiscal  we paid per share quarterly cash dividends on our common stock totaling million and we repurchased million of our common stock through our publicly announced share repurchase programs 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal in fiscal  we paid per share quarterly cash dividends on our common stock totaling million and we repurchased million of our common stock through our share repurchase program announced in august during fiscal and  we repurchased  and  shares  respectively  of restricted stock in connection with employee tax withholding obligations under employee compensation plans  which are not purchases under any publicly announced plan 
new store openings we expect our new stores in fiscal to increase approximately  reflecting net openings of chico s stores  net openings of wh bm stores  and net openings of soma stores 
we also expect to complete relocations or expansions in addition to converting approximately soma pop up stores to 
table of contents permanent stores 
we continuously evaluate the appropriate new store growth rate in light of economic conditions and may adjust the growth rate as conditions require or as opportunities arise 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january  amounts in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases purchase orders capital expenditures total as of january   our contractual obligations consisted of amounts outstanding under operating leases  open purchase orders for inventory  in the normal course of business  which are cancellable with no or limited recourse available to the vendor until the merchandise shipping date and contractual commitments for fiscal capital expenditures 
until formal resolutions are reached between us and the relevant taxing authorities  we are unable to estimate a final determination related to our uncertain tax positions and therefore  we have excluded the uncertain tax positions  totaling million at january  from the above table 
credit facility on july   we entered into a million senior five year unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility with a syndicate led by jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent and hsbc bank usa  national association  as syndication agent

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and believes the following assumptions and estimates are significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 
inventory valuation and shrinkage we identify potentially excess and slow moving inventories by evaluating turn rates and inventory levels in conjunction with our overall sales trend 
excess quantities of inventory are identified through evaluation of inventory aging  review of inventory turns and historical sales experiences  as well as specific identification based on fashion trends 
further  exposure to inadequate realization of carrying value is identified through analysis of gross margins and markdowns in combination with changes in current business trends 
we provide lower of cost or market adjustments for such identified excess and slow moving inventories 
historically  the variation of those estimates to actual results is immaterial and material variation is not expected in the future 
we estimate our expected shrinkage of inventories between our physical inventory counts by using average store shrinkage experience rates  which are updated on a regular basis 
historically  the variation of those estimates to actual results is immaterial and material variation is not expected in the future 
revenue recognition retail sales at our stores are recorded at the point of sale and are net of estimated customer returns  sales discounts under the passport club and the black book loyalty programs and company issued coupons  promotional discounts and associate discounts 
we record sales from our websites and catalogs based on the estimated receipt date of the product by our customers 
under our current program  gift cards do not have expiration dates 
we account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time the gift card is sold 
the liability is relieved and revenue is recognized for gift cards upon redemption 
in addition  we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards based on determining that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions commonly referred to as gift card breakage 
we recognize gift card breakage under the redemption recognition method 
this method records gift card breakage as revenue on a proportional basis over the redemption period based on our historical gift card breakage rate 
we determine the gift card breakage rate based on our historical redemption patterns 
as part of the normal sales cycle  we receive customer merchandise returns related to store and website sales 
to account for the financial impact of potential customer merchandise returns  we estimate future returns on previously sold merchandise 
reductions in sales and gross margin are recorded for estimated merchandise returns based on return history  current sales levels and projected future return levels 
evaluation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed periodically for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount  an asset is determined to be impaired  and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the fair value of an asset is estimated 
table of contents using estimated future cash flows of the asset discounted by a rate commensurate with the risk involved with such asset while incorporating marketplace assumptions 
the estimate of future cash flows requires management to make certain assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future sales and the useful lives of the assets 
we exercise our best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding our business when applying these impairment rules 
we establish our assumptions and arrive at the estimates used in these calculations based upon our historical experience  knowledge of the retail industry and by incorporating third party data  which we believe results in a reasonably accurate approximation of fair value 
nevertheless  changes in the assumptions used could have an impact on our assessment of recoverability 
in  we early adopted guidance that provides companies with an option to use a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment 
if the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the two step impairment test will be performed 
if we conclude that this is not the case  then the two step impairment test will not be required 
for  we performed the qualitative assessment and concluded that the fair value of our reporting units were not less than their carrying amounts 
operating leases rent expense under store operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the leases 
landlord incentives  rent free periods  rent escalation clauses and other rental expenses are also amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  which includes the construction period and which is generally days prior to the store opening date when we generally begin improvements in preparation for our intended use 
tenant improvement allowances are recorded as a deferred lease credit within deferred liabilities and amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease  which includes the construction period and one renewal when there is a significant economic cost associated with non renewal 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and published guidance as applicable to our operations 
no valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets  since management anticipates that the full amount of these assets should be realized in the future 
our effective tax rate considers management s judgment of expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax 
we record amounts for uncertain tax positions that management believes are supportable  but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority 
consequently  changes in our assumptions and judgments could materially affect amounts recognized related to income tax uncertainties and may affect our results of operations or financial position 
we believe our assumptions for estimates continue to be reasonable  although actual results may have a positive or negative material impact on the balances of such tax positions 
historically  the variation of estimates to actual results is immaterial and material variation is not expected in the future 
stock based compensation expense the calculation of stock based employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management s judgment 
these estimates include the fair value of each of the stock option awards granted  which is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
there are two significant inputs into the black scholes option pricing model expected volatility and expected term 
we estimate expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted 
the expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under our stock option plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be 
table of contents outstanding 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
historically  the variation of estimates to actual results is immaterial and material variation is not expected in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate  and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
in determining the portion of the stock based payment award that is ultimately expected to be earned  we derive forfeiture rates based on historical data 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance  we revise our forfeiture rates  when necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those originally estimated 
as a result  in the event that a grant s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate at the completion of the vesting period  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we recorded in current and prior periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on stock based compensation 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued new disclosure guidance related to the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income 
this guidance provides an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity was eliminated 
this accounting standard is effective for periods beginning on or after december  other than the change in presentation  this accounting standard will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk of our financial instruments as of january  has not significantly changed since january  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on any future indebtedness and our marketable securities 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates in part to our revolving line of credit with our bank 
however  as of january   we did not have any outstanding borrowings on our line of credit and  given our current liquidity position  do not expect to utilize our line of credit in the foreseeable future 
our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which identifies allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer 
our investment portfolio consists of cash equivalents and marketable securities including municipal bonds  corporate bonds  and us government and agency securities 
the portfolio as of january   consisted of million of securities with maturity dates less than one year and million with maturity dates over one year and less than or equal to two years 
we consider all securities available for sale  including those with maturity dates beyond months  and therefore classify these securities as short term investments within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets as they are available to support current operational liquidity needs 
as of january   an increase of basis points in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
conversely  a reduction of basis points in interest rates would increase the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately million
