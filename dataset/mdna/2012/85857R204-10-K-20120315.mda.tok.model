overview the company we are engaged in researching  developing  and commercializing stem cell therapeutics and enabling tools and technologies for stem cell based research and drug discovery and development 
our research and development r d programs are primarily focused on identifying and developing potential cell based therapeutics which can either restore or support organ function 
in particular  since we relocated our corporate headquarters to california in  our r d efforts have been directed at refining our methods for identifying  isolating  culturing  and purifying the human neural stem cell and human liver engrafting cells hlec and developing these as potential cell based therapeutics for the central nervous system cns and the liver  respectively 
in our cns program  our hucns sc product candidate purified human neural stem cells is currently in clinical development for several indications pelizeaus merzbacher disease pmd  a myelination disorder in the brain  chronic spinal cord injury and dry age related macular degeneration amd 
in february  we completed our phase i clinical trial in pmd  and the data from this trial is expected to be reported in late march we are conducting a phase i ii clinical trial in switzerland for the treatment of chronic spinal cord injury 
this trial was authorized by swissmedic and we completed the enrollment and dosing of the first patient cohort of this trial in december in january  we received authorization from the fda to conduct a phase i ii clinical trial in dry amd  and we expect to initiate this trial later in we previously completed a phase i clinical trial in infantile and late infantile ncl  and the data from that trial showed that our hucns sc cells were well tolerated and non tumorigenic  and that there was evidence of engraftment and long term survival of the transplanted hucns sc cells 
in our liver program  we are focused on identifying and 
table of contents developing liver cells as potential therapeutics for a range of liver diseases 
we have identified a subset of our human liver engrafting cells hlec which we believe may be a candidate for product development 
in october  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary to focus on both the therapeutic and research tool applications of our hlec technologies and to serve as an investment vehicle for those interested in a pure play liver cell company 
for a brief description of our significant therapeutic research and development programs see overview research and development programs in the business section of part i  item of this form k 
we have also conducted research on several other cell types and in other areas  which could lead to other possible product candidates  process improvements or further research activities 
we are also engaged in developing and commercializing applications of our technologies to enable research  which we believe represent current and nearer term commercial opportunities 
our portfolio of technologies includes cell technologies relating to embryonic stem cells  induced pluripotent stem ips cells  and tissue derived adult stem cells  expertise and infrastructure for providing cell based assays for drug discovery  a cell culture products and antibody reagents business  and an intellectual property portfolio with claims relevant to cell processing  reprogramming and manipulation  as well as to gene targeting and insertion 
many of these enabling technologies were acquired in april as part of our acquisition of the operations of stem cell sciences plc scs 
see note  acquisition of scs operations  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for further information 
we have not derived any revenue or cash flows from the sale or commercialization of any products except for license revenue for certain of our patented cells and sales of cell culture products for use in research 
as a result  we have incurred annual operating losses since inception and expect to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
therefore  we are dependent upon external financing from equity and debt offerings and revenue from collaborative research arrangements with corporate sponsors to finance our operations 
we have no such collaborative research arrangements at this time and there can be no assurance that such financing or partnering revenue will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
before we can derive revenue or cash inflows from the commercialization of any of our therapeutic product candidates  we will need to i conduct substantial in vitro testing and characterization of our proprietary cell types  ii undertake preclinical and clinical testing for specific disease indications  iii develop  validate and scale up manufacturing processes to produce these cell based therapeutics  and iv obtain required regulatory approvals 
these steps are risky  expensive and time consuming 
overall  we expect our r d expenses to be substantial and to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical investigation of our current and future product candidates 
however  expenditures on r d programs are subject to many uncertainties  including whether we develop our product candidates with a partner or independently 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our current product candidates will be subject to future collaboration  when such collaboration agreements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
in addition  there are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our cell based therapeutics  including future trial design and regulatory requirements  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time given the stage of our development and the novel nature of stem cell technologies 
the regulatory pathways  both in the united states and internationally  are complex and fluid given the novel and  in general  clinically unproven nature of stem cell technologies 
at this time  due to such uncertainties and inherent risks  we cannot estimate in a meaningful way the duration of  or the costs to complete  our r d programs or whether  when or to what extent we will generate revenues or cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of any of our therapeutic product candidates 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our product development programs  our future r d expenses will depend on the determinations we make as to the scientific and clinical prospects of each product candidate  as well as our ongoing assessment of the regulatory requirements and each product candidate s commercial potential 
given the early stage of development of our therapeutic product candidates  any estimates of when we may be able to commercialize one or more of these products would not be meaningful 
moreover  any estimate of the 
table of contents time and investment required to develop potential products based upon our proprietary hucns sc and hlec technologies will change depending on the ultimate approach or approaches we take to pursue them  the results of preclinical and clinical studies  and the content and timing of decisions made by the fda  swissmedic and other regulatory authorities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop any product successfully  or that we will be able to recover our development costs  whether upon commercialization of a developed product or otherwise 
we cannot provide assurance that any of these programs will result in products that can be marketed or marketed profitably 
if certain of our development stage programs do not result in commercially viable products  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the research markets served by our tools and technologies products are highly competitive  complex and dynamic 
technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in biological research  and stem cell technologies have been evolving particularly fast 
we compete mainly by focusing on specialty media and antibody reagent products and cell based assays  which are custom designed for use in stem cell based research  where we believe our expertise  intellectual property and reputation give us competitive advantage 
we believe that  in this particular market niche  our products and technologies offer customers specific advantages over those offered by our competitors 
we compete by offering innovative  quality controlled products  consistently made and designed to produce reproducible results 
we continue to make investments in research and development  quality management  quality improvement  and product innovation 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments 
for the year ended december   we generated revenues from the sale of specialty cell culture products of approximately  we can give no assurances that we will be able to continue to generate such revenues in the future 
significant events therapeutic product development in february  the fourth and final patient in our phase i clinical trial in pelizaeus merzbacher disease  was enrolled and transplanted with our hucns sc human neural stem cells 
this trial  which is being conducted at ucsf benioff children s hospital  is the first to evaluate neural stem cells as a potential treatment for a myelination disorder 
in march  we initiated a phase i ii clinical trial of our hucns sc human neural stem cells in chronic spinal cord injury 
the trial is expected to enroll a total of patients who are three to months post injury  and will include patients with both complete and incomplete injuries as classified by the american spinal injury association impairment scale ais 
the trial was authorized by swissmedic and is being conducted in switzerland at the balgrist university hospital  university of zurich  a world leading medical center for spinal cord injury and rehabilitation 
in april  we entered into a collaboration with a world renowned leader in alzheimer s disease research  to study the therapeutic potential of our hucns sc human neural stem cells in alzheimer s disease 
published research has shown that mouse neural stem cells enhance memory in a mouse model of alzheimer s disease  and the goal of this collaboration is to replicate these results using our human neural stem cells 
in june  at the international society for stem cell research isscr th annual meeting  we presented evidence of engraftment  migration and the long term survival of our hucns sc neural stem cells following transplantation into patients with a severe neurological disorder 
importantly  the results show that the cells can persist following the cessation of immunosuppression 
the data supports our premise regarding the viability and utility of neural stem cell therapy as a potential treatment for a wide range of cns disorders 
in september  the first patient in our phase i ii clinical trial in chronic spinal cord injury was enrolled and successfully transplanted with our hucns sc cells 
this landmark clinical trial has a unique design  in which patients with progressively decreasing severity of injury will be treated in three sequential cohorts 
the first patient has an injury classified as ais a  with complete loss of sensation and mobility from the waist down 

table of contents in november  we reported that an interim review of one patient s mris from our phase i pmd trial showed changes consistent with the development of new myelin in the regions in which the hucns sc cells were transplanted  and that the safety data suggest the procedure and cells have been well tolerated 
in december  we successfully completed the enrollment and dosing of the first cohort of patients in our phase i ii clinical trial in chronic spinal cord injury 
the first cohort of patients all have spinal cord injury classified as ais a  the most severe level identified by the ais 
we also announced that enrollment for the remainder of the trial  which will include patients classified as ais b and ais c  would be open to patients living in the united states and canada 
in january  we published preclinical data demonstrating that our proprietary hucns sc cells protect host photoreceptors and preserve vision in a well established animal model of retinal disease 
moreover  the number of cone photoreceptors  which are responsible for central vision  remained constant over an extended period 
the preclinical results are highly relevant to human disorders of vision loss  the most notable of which is dry age related macular degeneration amd 
the data was featured as the cover article in the international peer reviewed european journal of neuroscience 
in january  the fda authorized the initiation of a phase i ii clinical trial of our proprietary hucns sc cells in amd  the most common form of amd 
amd is the leading cause of vision loss and blindness in people over years of age  and approximately million people worldwide are afflicted with the disease 
there are no approved treatments for dry amd 
in february  the fourth and final patient in our phase i pmd trial completed the twelve month follow up and evaluations required by the trial protocol 
results of the trial will be reported at the european leukodystrophy association meeting to be held in paris  france  march april  tools and technologies programs in january  we launched stem and stem  two new antibody reagents that has utility for the isolation and detection of a range of different human cell types 
in march  we launched nine new products and three related kits to facilitate stem cell research 
this new line of purified nucleic acid and protein stem cell lysate products enable stem cell researchers to more accurately test and validate stem cell lines and associated genes and gene products 
these new reagents are serum free and are produced by purification of the dna  rna or protein content of the lysates of homogenous mouse stem cell lines 
also in march  we launched three new cell culture supplements for the derivation  culture and differentiation of human and mouse embryonic stem cells  induced pluripotent stem cells  and tissue derived neural stem cells 
these new supplements provide researchers with additional choices to use either a defined  serum free  or a defined  serum free and animal component free version of culture supplements that are considered to be fundamental reagents for stem cell research 
in july  a collaborative study was published which used commercially available sc proven serum free cell culture media for the reproducible and robust production of large numbers of genetically stable  self renewing cells that retain true multi potent biological function over extended culture periods 
this work overcame a key hurdle to the use of non immortalized cells for regenerative medicine  and demonstrated the utility of human tissue derived neural stem cells as a scalable platform for cell based drug discovery and drug screening applications 
the paper was published in a special edition of neurochemistry international dedicated to the potential of stem cells for st century neuroscience 

table of contents financing and other business related activities in january  we sold  shares of our common stock to selected institutional investors at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds  after deducting offering expenses and fees  of approximately  the investors were also granted an option to purchase an additional  shares at per share 
the option was not exercised and expired on february  the shares were offered under our effective shelf registration statement previously filed with the sec 
in july  we relocated our corporate headquarters and us based research and development operations to newark  california 
our new facilities comprise newly constructed  custom designed laboratory and office space  and house the majority of our us workforce 
in july  following the affirmative vote of our stockholders at our annual meeting  we effected a one for ten reverse stock split which reduced the number of shares outstanding from approximately million to approximately million 
in july  we received notification from the nasdaq stock market that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement needed to continue listing on the nasdaq global market 
the nasdaq listing rules require the company s stock to evidence a closing bid price of per share or more for ten consecutive days 
in september  the california institute of regenerative medicine cirm awarded us a disease team therapy development planning award totaling approximately  we were one of only four companies to be awarded a disease team planning grant  which helped us and our collaborators prepare and submit an application for a disease team therapy development research award to evaluate our proprietary hucns sc cells as a potential treatment for alzheimer s disease 
each research award may be up to million  payable over four years  to fund preclinical and ind enabling activities with the aim of starting human clinical trials within a four year window 
in december  we raised gross proceeds of million through a public offering of  units and  series b warrants 
the combination of units and series b warrants were sold at a public offering price of per unit 
each series b warrant gives the holder the right to purchase one unit at an exercise price of per unit and is exercisable until may   the th trading day after the date of issuance 
each unit consists of one share of our common stock and one series a warrant 
each series a warrant gives the holder the right to purchase one share of our common stock at an initial exercise price of per share 
the series a warrants are immediately exercisable upon issuance and will expire on the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the initial financing transaction in december the shares were offered under our effective shelf registration statement previously filed with the sec 
in january  we submitted two applications to the cirm for disease team research awards  one for alzheimer s disease and the second for spinal cord injury 
each research award may be up to million  payable over four years  to fund preclinical and ind enabling activities with the aim of starting human clinical trials within a four year window 
the cirm has indicated it plans to approve and fund research awards in the summer of critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates 
table of contents form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we have established internal controls related to the preparation of these estimates 
actual results and the timing of the results could differ materially from these estimates 
warrant liability we account for our warrants in accordance with us gaap which defines how freestanding contracts that are indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock should be measured and classified 
authoritative accounting guidance prescribes that only warrants issued under contracts that cannot be net cash settled  and are both indexed to and settled in the company s common stock can be classified as equity as part of both our november and november financings  we issued warrants with five year terms to purchase  and  shares of our common stock at and per share respectively 
as part of our december financing  we issued series a warrants with five year terms to purchase  shares at per share and series b warrants with a ninety trading days terms to purchase  units at per unit 
each unit underlying the series b warrant consists of one share of our common stock and one series a warrant 
as the warrant agreements did not meet the specific conditions for equity classification  we are required to classify the fair value of the warrants issued as a liability  with subsequent changes in fair value to be recorded as income loss on change in fair value of warrant liability 
the fair value of the warrants related to the and financings is determined using the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model and the fair value of the warrants related to the financing is determined using the monte carlo simulation model 
the fair value is affected by changes in inputs to those models including our stock price  expected stock price volatility  the contractual term and the risk free interest rate 
the use of the monte carlo simulation model requires input of additional subjective assumptions including the progress of our r d programs and its affect on potential future financings 
we will continue to classify the fair value of the warrants as a liability until the warrants are exercised  expire or are amended in a way that would no longer require these warrants to be classified as a liability 
the estimated fair value of our warrant liability at december   was approximately  stock based compensation us gaap requires us to recognize expense related to the fair value of our stock based compensation awards  including employee stock options and restricted stock units 
employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain assumptions  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the risk free interest rate 
our estimate of the expected volatility is based on historical volatility 
the expected term represents the period during which our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
in  we estimated this amount based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting requirements  and expectation of future employee behavior  including post vesting terminations 
our estimate of the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury debt securities with maturities close to the expected term of the option as of the date of grant 
we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  our assumptions in future periods may change 
at the end of each reporting period we estimate forfeiture rates based on our historical experience within separate groups of employees and adjust stock based compensation expense accordingly 
for the year ended december   employee stock based compensation expense stock options  restricted stock units and k plan employer match in form of shares was approximately  as of december   total compensation cost related to unvested stock options and restricted stock units not yet recognized was approximately  which is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents wind down expenses rhode island in connection with our wind down of our research and manufacturing operations in lincoln  rhode island  and the relocation of our corporate headquarters and remaining research laboratories to california in october  we provided a reserve for our estimate of the exit cost obligation 
the reserve reflects estimates of the ongoing costs of our former research and administrative facility in lincoln  which we hold on a lease that terminates on june  we are seeking to sublease  assign  sell  or otherwise divest ourselves of our interest in the facility at the earliest possible time  but we cannot determine with certainty a fixed date by which such events will occur  if at all 
in determining the facility exit cost reserve amount  we are required to consider our lease payments through the end of the lease term and estimate other relevant factors such as facility operating expenses  real estate market conditions in rhode island for similar facilities  occupancy rates  and sublease rental rates projected over the course of the leasehold 
we re evaluate the estimate each quarter  taking into account changes  if any  in each of the underlying factors 
the process is inherently subjective because it involves projections into time from the date of the estimate through the end of the lease and it is not possible to determine any of the factors except the lease payments with certainty over that period 
management forms its best estimate on a quarterly basis  after considering actual sublease activity  reports from our broker realtor about current and predicted real estate market conditions in rhode island  the likelihood of new subleases in the foreseeable future for the specific facility and significant changes in the actual or projected operating expenses of the property 
we discount the projected net outflow over the term of the lease to arrive at the present value  and adjust the reserve to that figure 
the estimated vacancy rate for the facility is an important assumption in determining the reserve because changes in this assumption have the greatest effect on estimated sublease income 
in addition  the vacancy rate estimate is the variable most subject to change  while at the same time it involves the greatest judgment and uncertainty due to the absence of highly predictive information concerning the future of the local economy and future demand for specialized laboratory and office space in that area 
the average vacancy rate of the facility over the last nine years through was approximately  varying from to 
as of december   based on current information available to management  the vacancy rate is projected to be approximately from through the end of the lease 
these estimates are based on actual occupancy as of december   predicted lead time for acquiring new subtenants  historical vacancy rates for the area and assessments by our broker realtor of future real estate market conditions 
due to the short time remaining on the lease period  the reserve assumes no additional tenants from to the end of the lease 
a increase or decrease in the operating expenses for the facility from on would have increased or decreased the reserve by approximately  management does not wait for specific events to change its estimate  but instead uses its best efforts to anticipate them on a quarterly basis 
for the year ended december   we recorded actual expenses against this reserve  net of subtenant income  of approximately  based on management s evaluation of the factors mentioned above  and particularly the projected vacancy rates described above  we adjusted the reserve in by recording an additional  as wind down expenses 
at december   the reserve was  australia on april   as part of our acquisition of the scs operations  we acquired certain operations near melbourne  australia 
in order to reduce operating complexity and expenses  we made the decision to close our site in australia and consolidate personnel and programs to our cambridge  uk and palo alto  california sites 
at june   we established a reserve of approximately  for the estimated costs to close down and exit our australia operations 
the reserve reflects the estimated cost to terminate our facility lease in australia which provided for an original termination date of december   employee termination benefits and 
table of contents other liabilities associated with the wind down and relocation of our operations in australia 
as of december   the facility lease agreement has been terminated and our operations in australia have been relocated to cambridge  uk and palo alto  california 
we recorded actual expenses  net of foreign currency translation changes  of approximately  against this reserve 
at december   we concluded that all costs related to the close down and exit of our australia operations have been recorded against the reserve and we closed the reserve by crediting the remaining reserve balance of  to wind down expense 
goodwill and other intangible assets patent and license costs goodwill of approximately  at december   relates to the acquisition of scs operations 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  or if business conditions change  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the evaluations  and it is possible  even likely  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analysis are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges in a future period 
we completed our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of  and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
other intangible assets  net were approximately  at december  intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight line basis over the periods benefited 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
prior to fiscal year  we capitalized certain patent costs  which are being amortized over the estimated life of the patent and would be expensed at the time such patents are deemed to have no continuing value 
since  all patent costs are expensed as incurred 
license costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the license agreement 
in  we wrote off the unamortized amount of approximately  for certain license agreements that we terminated 
in december  in part because of management s decision to focus on our therapeutic product development programs and not to allocate time and resources to the assays technology  we determined that we could not predict the future cash flows from the intangible ipr d asset related to the assays technology 
therefore  we determined that the intangible asset was impaired and wrote off the approximately  carrying value of the asset 
impairment of long lived tangible assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if property  plant  and equipment are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its estimated fair market value 
in  we recorded a charge of approximately  to adjust the fair value of certain lab equipment we expect to dispose 
no such impairment was recognized during the years and income taxes when accounting for income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
income tax receivables and liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities 
developing our provision for income taxes and analyzing our tax positions requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 

table of contents we assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on such evidence that can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  income losses expected in future years  and the applicable statute of limitations 
tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied  the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are reversed in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied 
we concluded that the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
results of operations our results of operations have varied significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and may vary significantly in the future due to the occurrence of material recurring and nonrecurring events  including without limitation the receipt and payment of recurring and nonrecurring licensing payments  the initiation or termination of research collaborations  the on going expenses to lease and maintain our rhode island facilities  other than temporary impairment of our financial assets  changes in estimated fair value of our warrant liability  and increasing operating costs

research and development expenses our r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  costs associated with clinical trials and regulatory submissions  costs associated with preclinical activities such as toxicology studies  costs associated with cell processing and process development  certain patent related costs such as licensing  facilities related costs such as depreciation  lab equipment  and supplies 
clinical trial expenses include payments to vendors such as clinical research organizations  contract manufacturers  clinical trial sites  laboratories for testing clinical samples and consultants 
cumulative r d costs incurred since we refocused our activities on developing cell based therapeutics fiscal years through were approximately million 
over this period  the majority of these cumulative costs were related to i characterization of our proprietary hucns sc cell  ii expenditures for toxicology and other preclinical studies  preparation and submission of applications to regulatory agencies to conduct clinical trials and obtaining regulatory clearance to initiate such trials  all with respect to our hucns sc cells  iii preclinical studies and development of our human liver engrafting cells  iv costs associated with cell processing and process development  and v costs associated with our clinical studies 

table of contents we use and manage our r d resources  including our employees and facilities  across various projects rather than on a project by project basis for the following reasons 
the allocations of time and resources change as the needs and priorities of individual projects and programs change  and many of our researchers are assigned to more than one project at any given time 
furthermore  we are exploring multiple possible uses for each of our proprietary cell types  so much of our r d effort is complementary to and supportive of each of these projects 
lastly  much of our r d effort is focused on manufacturing processes  which can result in process improvements useful across cell types 
we also use external service providers to assist in the conduct of our clinical trials  to manufacture certain of our product candidates and to provide various other r d related products and services

for fair value measurements categorized in level of the fair value hierarchy  the new guidance requires disclosure of quantitative information about unobservable inputs  a description of the valuation processes used by the entity  and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs and the interrelationships between those unobservable inputs  if any 
entities must report the level in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities that are not recorded at fair value in the statement of financial position but for which fair value is disclosed 
the new requirements clarify that the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise only apply to measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets 
the new requirements also specify that in the absence of a level input  a reporting entity should incorporate a premium or a discount in a fair value measurement if a market participant would take into account such an input in pricing and asset or liability 
additionally  the new guidance introduces an option to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities with offsetting positions on a net basis if certain criteria are met 
for public entities  these new requirements become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  these requirements are applicable to our fiscal year beginning january  we do not expect this new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance which eliminates the current option to present other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
however  under the new guidance  comprehensive income and its components must still be presented under one of two new alternatives 
under the first alternative  the components of other comprehensive income and the components of net income may be presented in one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income 
under the second alternative  a statement of other comprehensive income would immediately follow the statement of net income and must be shown with equal prominence as the other primary financial statements 
under either alternative  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
for public entities  these new requirements will become effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  and should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented 
they are applicable to our fiscal year beginning january  we do not expect this new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued an update to previous guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in this update simplifies how entities  both public and nonpublic  test goodwill for impairment 
under the amendments  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  
table of contents then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect this new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

our foreign exchange risk is an exposure to foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of our foreign subsidiary in the united kingdom

adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity under the caption unrealized gain loss on foreign currency translation 
a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar in relation to the gbp would have resulted in an approximate  increase in our net loss reported for the year ended december  because we are currently not subject to material foreign currency exchange risk with respect to revenue transactions and cash balances  we have not to date entered into any hedging contracts
