overview founded in  body central corp 
is a multi channel specialty retailer offering on trend  quality apparel and accessories at value prices 
we operate specialty apparel stores under the body central and body shop banners  as well as a direct business comprised of our body central catalog and our e commerce website at www 
bodyc 
com 
we target women in their late teens and twenties from diverse cultural backgrounds  who seek the latest fashions and a flattering fit 
our stores feature an assortment of tops  dresses  bottoms  jewelry  accessories and shoes sold primarily under our exclusive body central and lipstick labels 
we continually update our merchandise and floor sets with an emphasis on coordinated outfits presented by lifestyle to give our customers a reason to shop our stores frequently 
we believe our multi channel strategy supports our brand building efforts and provides us with synergistic growth opportunities across all of our sales channels 
as of december   we had stores with an average size of approximately  square feet 
our stores are located in fashion retail venues in the south  mid atlantic and midwest 
we opened new stores and closed one store in fiscal year how we assess the performance of our business in assessing the performance of our business  we consider a variety of operational and financial measures 
the key measures for determining how our business is performing are net revenues  comparable store and non comparable store sales  direct sales through our catalog and e commerce channels  gross profit margin and selling  general and administrative expenses 
net revenues net revenues consist of sales of our merchandise from comparable stores and non comparable stores  and direct sales through our catalog and e commerce channels  including shipping and handling fees charged to our customers 
net revenues from our stores and direct business reflect sales of our merchandise less estimated returns and merchandise discounts 
store sales there may be variations in the way in which other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales 
we include a store in comparable store sales on the first day of the fourteenth month after a store opens 
non comparable store sales include sales not included in comparable store sales for example  the first two months of a new store s sales and sales from closed stores 
measuring the change in year over year comparable store sales allows us to evaluate how our store base is performing 
various factors affect comparable store sales  including consumer preferences  buying trends and overall economic trends  our ability to identify and respond effectively to fashion trends and customer preferences  changes in competition  
table of contents changes in our merchandise mix  changes in pricing levels and average unit price  the timing of our releases of new merchandise  the level of customer service that we provide in our stores  our ability to source and distribute products efficiently  and the number of stores we open and close in any period 
opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy 
we expect a significant percentage of our net revenues to come from non comparable store sales 
accordingly  comparable store sales is only one element we use to assess the success of our growth strategy 
purchases of apparel and accessories are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending  including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income  consumer debt  interest rates and consumer confidence 
our business is somewhat seasonal and as a result  our revenues fluctuate 
in addition  our revenues in any given quarter can be affected by timing of holidays  the weather and other factors beyond our control 
direct sales we offer direct sales through our catalogs and through our e commerce website  www 
bodyc 
com  which accepts orders directly from our customers 
we believe the circulation of our catalogs and access to our website increases our reputation and brand recognition with our target customers and helps support the strength of our store operations 
direct sales are not included in our comparable store sales 
gross profit gross profit is equal to our net revenues minus our cost of goods sold 
gross profit margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our net revenues 
cost of goods sold includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise  distribution costs  all freight costs incurred to ship merchandise to our stores and our direct customers  costs incurred to produce and distribute our catalogs  store occupancy costs  buying costs and inventory shrinkage 
the components of our cost of goods sold may not be comparable to those of other retailers 
our cost of goods sold is greater in higher volume periods because cost of goods sold generally increases as net revenues increase 
changes in the mix of our products  such as changes in the proportion of accessories  may also impact our cost of goods sold 
we review our inventory levels on an ongoing basis in order to identify slow moving merchandise and take appropriate markdowns to clear these goods 
the timing and level of markdowns are not seasonal in nature  but are driven by customer acceptance of our merchandise 
if we misjudge sales levels and or trends  we may be faced with excess inventories and be required to mark down our prices for those products in order to sell them 
significant markdowns have reduced our gross profit in some prior periods and may do so in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include all operating costs not included in cost of goods sold 
these expenses include payroll and other expenses related to operations at our corporate headquarters and store operations 
these expenses do not generally vary proportionally with net revenues 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues are usually higher in lower volume periods and usually lower in higher volume periods 
the components of our selling  general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to those of other retailers 
we 
table of contents expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods due to our continuing store growth and continuing growth in our direct business 
results of operations the following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net revenues as well as selected non financial operating data fiscal year ended december  january  january  percentage of net revenues net revenues cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization impairment of long lived assets income from operations interest expense  net of interest income other expense income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income operating data stores comparable store sales change number of stores open at end of period sales per gross square foot in whole dollars average square feet per store total gross square feet at end of period in thousands direct number of catalogs circulated in thousands revenue per catalog in whole dollars we have determined our operating segments on the same basis that we use internally to evaluate performance 
our operating segments are our stores and our direct business  which have been aggregated into one reportable segment 
we aggregate our operating segments because they have a similar class of customer  nature of products  nature of production process and distribution methods  as well as similar economic characteristics

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are currently cash flows from operations 
our primary cash needs are capital expenditures in connection with opening new stores  remodeling or relocating existing stores  distributing our catalogs  operating our website and the additional working capital required for running our operations 
cash is also required for investment in our information technology systems  maintenance of existing facilities and distribution facility enhancements  when required 
the most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents  merchandise inventories  trade payables and other current liabilities 
our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or  in the case of credit or debit card transactions  within several days of the related sale  and we typically have up to days to pay our merchandise vendors  depending on the applicable vendor terms 
our ability to fund such cash flow needs depends largely on our future operating performance 
we assess future operating performance by looking at a number of metrics  primarily our net revenues  comparable store and non comparable store sales  direct sales through our catalog and e commerce channels  gross profit margin  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
our liquidity position is directly affected by these performance metrics 
on october   we completed our initial public offering of our common stock which included  new shares sold by us and  shares sold by our existing stockholders  raising net proceeds of million for us  after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses payable by us 
on october   we used net proceeds of million from our initial public offering to repay all amounts owed under our senior credit facility  including million for outstanding principal  and million to redeem all outstanding shares of our non convertible  non voting series c preferred stock 
there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility of our senior credit facility at the time of repayment 
subsequently  the senior credit facility was terminated 
on february   we closed a secondary offering of  shares of our common stock priced at per share 
we sold  new shares of common stock in the offering  and the selling shareholders sold  shares in the offering  including  shares sold pursuant to the underwriter s over allotment option 
the offering raised net proceeds of million for the company  after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses payable by us 
subsequent to our december  fiscal year end  on january   we entered into a line of credit agreement with branch banking and trust company that provides for a revolving line of credit facility in the amount of million with an accordion feature that allows branch banking and trust company to increase the facility up to million at its sole discretion 
the facility has a maturity date of may  and bears interest at the one month libor rate plus per annum  as adjusted monthly on the first day of each month  with an all in floor rate of 
the facility is secured by all the assets of the company 
the line of credit agreement includes a financial covenant requiring the company to have a tangible net worth as defined in the line of credit agreement of million quarterly  and other customary covenants

net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million during fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year this increase was attributable to a million increase in net income  a  favorable change in deferred income taxes and a  increase in our other working capital requirements offset by a million unfavorable change in our requirements for inventory  net of merchandise accounts payable 
the unfavorable change in our cash requirements for inventory  net of merchandise accounts payable  was principally due to the increase in the number of stores and earlier shipments of spring merchandise for fiscal year offset by more favorable terms with our trade vendors

in addition  we paid million in scheduled quarterly principal repayments plus an additional million on our prior senior credit facility in fiscal year  based on our operating results for fiscal year the million use of net cash in fiscal year resulted from the scheduled quarterly principal repayments due under our prior senior credit facility 
line of credit subsequent to our december  fiscal year end  on january   we entered into a line of credit agreement with branch banking and trust company that provides for a revolving line of credit facility in the amount of million with an accordion feature that allows branch banking and trust company to increase the facility up to million at its sole discretion

the line of credit agreement includes a financial covenant requiring the company to have a tangible net worth as defined in the line of credit agreement of million quarterly  and other customary covenants 
outlook our short term and long term liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures associated with our growth strategy and working capital requirements 
we believe that our cash position  net cash provided by operating activities  availability under the line of credit agreement as well as net proceeds from our secondary common stock offering in february will be adequate to finance our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for at least the next months 
planned capital expenditures for fiscal year include expenditures for at least new stores  relocation of and maintenance of existing stores  maintenance of corporate facilities  and investments in information technology systems  which includes investing in and upgrading several of our systems to provide improved support of our current operations and position us for future growth

impact of inflation our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required  we believe the effects of inflation  if any  on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income  which amends asc  comprehensive income 
the amended guidance requires most entities present changes in net income and other comprehensive income in either a single statement of comprehensive income or two separate  but consecutive  statements 
the objective of these amendments is to improve the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements or disclosures 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other 
this guidance is intended to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
this update permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
this asu becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements or disclosures 
the company has opted for early adoption of this asu as noted in footnote nature of business and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations has been derived from our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
table of contents the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  our management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventory valuation  property and equipment  recoverability of long lived assets  including intangible assets  income taxes and stock based compensation 
our management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors and assumptions it believes to be reasonable to form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions which would require us to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods 
our management has reviewed critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
the following reflect the most critical accounting policies and significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note of our consolidated financial statements nature of business and summary of significant accounting policies appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the point of sale or upon shipment to customers 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers for direct sales are included in net revenues 
based on historical sales returns  an allowance for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of net revenues in the periods in which the sales are recognized 
sales tax collected from customers is excluded from net revenues and is included as part of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
beginning in march  we began selling gift cards in our stores  which do not expire or lose value over periods of inactivity 
we account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold 
through june  we sold gift certificates in our stores  which also do not expire or lose value over periods of inactivity 
we recognize revenue from gift cards and gift certificates when they are redeemed by the customer 
inventory valuation inventories are comprised primarily of women s apparel and accessories and are stated at the lower of cost or market  on a first in  first out basis  using the retail inventory method 
we record merchandise receipts at the time they are delivered to our merchandise consolidator as this is the point at which title and risk of loss transfer to us 
we do not directly import any merchandise at this time 
we review our inventory levels to identify slow moving merchandise and generally use markdowns to clear this merchandise 
we record a markdown reserve based on estimated future markdowns related to current inventory to clear slow moving inventory 
markdowns may occur when inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference  lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  competition or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price 
these markdowns may have an adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
the markdown reserve is recorded as an increase to cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we perform physical inventory counts on most stores semi annually 
included in the carrying value of merchandise inventories is a reserve for shrinkage 
shrinkage is estimated based on historical 
table of contents physical inventory results as a percentage of sales 
the estimate for shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
property and equipment  net property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of property and equipment is computed for financial reporting purposes on the straight line method using service lives ranging principally from three to fifteen years 
furniture and fixtures are typically depreciated over three to five years 
amortization of leasehold improvements is provided on the straight line method over the length of the lease or over the estimated useful life of the improvement  whichever is shorter 
the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income 
major renewals and betterments which extend service lives are capitalized  while expenditures for repairs and maintenance that do not significantly extend the life of the asset are expensed as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets we are exposed to potential impairment if the book value of our assets exceeds their expected future cash flows 
the major components of our long lived assets are store fixtures  equipment and leasehold improvements 
we follow fasb asc  property  plant and equipment  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
our evaluation is performed based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities compared with the carrying value of related assets for the individual stores 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized as the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets based on the discounted future cash flows of the assets using a rate that approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
goodwill goodwill of million was recognized on the acquisition of body shop of america  inc and catalogue ventures  inc 
on october  we follow fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other  which requires that goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are subject to an assessment of impairment at least annually 
under this guidance  we are required to compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount to determine if there is a potential impairment of goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million impairment of goodwill related to our store operations as a result of the slowing economy  repositioning of our merchandise strategy  competition with retailers and operating performance of our stores 
in the fourth quarter of we early adopted the new guidance under accounting standards update  intangibles goodwill and other  which simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment 
this new guidance provides an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the company performed this qualitative analysis as of december  the analysis considered factors such as the year over year change in our competitive retail sector  comparable store sales  catalog sales  the company s stock price  the company s debt levels and the company s cash balances 
the qualitative analysis further evaluated changes in the company s infrastructure including the replacement or addition to several key functions and individuals 
the company concluded that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value was greater than its carrying amount and therefore did not proceed to step one of the goodwill impairment test 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for pursuant to fasb asc  income taxes  which requires that we recognize deferred income taxes  which include net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits among other items 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are offset by deferred tax liabilities relating to nondeductible temporary differences 
recognition of deferred tax assets is based on management s belief that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit associated with temporary differences will be utilized 
the fasb issued guidance requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have determined that valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are not currently necessary 
we follow fasb asc  income taxes  guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the standard prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns 
in addition  the standard provides guidance on the de recognition  classification and disclosure of tax positions  as well as the accounting for related interest and penalties 
in may  the fasb amended the guidance associated with the criteria that must be evaluated in determining if a tax position has been effectively settled and should be recognized as a tax benefit 
we did not have any uncertain tax provisions recorded in our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services 
under the provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value and is recognized as an expense by the graded vested method over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
as required under this guidance  we estimate forfeitures for options granted which are not expected to vest 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measurement of the estimated fair value of our stock based compensation expense 
we estimate the grant date fair value of stock option awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
for fiscal years  and  the fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using the following weighted average assumptions fiscal year ended december  january  january  expected option term years years years expected volatility factor risk free interest rate expected annual dividend yield the risk free interest rate was determined based on the rate of us treasury instruments whose maturities are similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued 
the expected dividend yield was based on our expectations of not paying dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
the expected volatility incorporates historical volatility of similar entities whose shares prices are publicly available 
the expected term is based on the simplified method of estimating the option life 
on march   the company s board of directors approved  subject to stockholder approval  an amendment and restatement of the company s amended and restated equity plan the 
table of contents plan 
on may   the company s stockholders approved the amendment and restatement to the plan 
the amended and restated plan permits up to  of the remaining shares of common stock reserved for future issuance as of march  under the plan to be issued in the form of restricted stock awards and allows certain awards under the plan to qualify as performance based compensation under section m of the internal revenue code of  if the compensation committee of the company s board of directors chooses to qualify the awards in other respects 
for long term incentives  the company s board of directors established an annual equity grant protocol that resulted in an initial grant effective as of september  the committee s initial long term incentive awards granted to certain executives were roughly two thirds stock options and one third time vested restricted stock 
the stock options and restricted stock vest over a four year period 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options was million   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively  and is included in selling  general and administrative expenses and cost of goods sold on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company did not capitalize any expense related to stock based compensation 
we granted options to purchase an aggregate of   and  shares of common stock in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we granted  shares of restricted stock in and none in or we have granted  options to purchase shares of our common stock in fiscal year through march  any future equity grants will increase our stock based compensation expense in fiscal year and in future fiscal years compared to fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates with respect to its line of credit agreement 
for variable rate debt  including any future borrowings under the company s line of credit agreement  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of such debt  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
effects of inflation components of the company s operations subject to inflation include lease and labor costs 
the company s leases require it to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are subject to inflationary increases 
the company believes inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations in recent years
