overview the company is the nation s largest domestic tank barge operator  transporting bulk liquid products throughout the mississippi river system  on the gulf intracoastal waterway  and along all three united states coasts and in alaska and hawaii 
the company transports petrochemicals  black oil products  refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals by tank barge 
as of december   the company operated a fleet of inland tank barges  including leased barges  with million barrels of capacity  and operated an average of inland towboats during  of which an average of were chartered 
the company s coastal fleet consisted of tank barges  of which are leased and three are single hull  with million barrels of capacity  and owned coastal tugboats 
the company also owns and operates four offshore barge and tug units transporting dry bulk commodities in united states coastal trade 
through its diesel engine services segment the company provides after market services for medium speed and high speed diesel engines  reduction gears and ancillary products for marine and power generation applications  distributes and services high speed diesel engines and transmissions  pumps and compression products  and manufactures oilfield service equipment  including hydraulic fracturing equipment  for the land based pressure pumping and oilfield service markets 
for  net earnings attributable to kirby were  or per share  on revenues of  compared with net earnings attributable to kirby of  or per share  on revenues of  the second quarter and year results included an estimated 
per share negative impact from high water and flooding throughout the mississippi river system and along the gulf intracoastal waterway in the morgan city area  net of certain revenue and cost recovery from contracts with terms that provide reimbursements for delays and increased costs 
the year results included a 
per share severance charge associated with the consolidation of k sea s administrative staff with the administrative staff of the company and a 
per share charge associated with increasing the fair value of the united contingent earnout liability  partially offset by a 
per share credit in the provision for taxes on income associated with a favorable multi year ruling 
marine transportation for  of the company s revenue was generated by its marine transportation segment 
the segment s customers include many of the major petrochemical and refining companies that operate in the united states 
products transported include raw materials for many of the end products used widely by businesses and consumers plastics  fiber  paints  detergents  oil additives and paper  among others  as well as residual fuel oil  ship bunkers  asphalt  gasoline  diesel fuel  heating oil and agricultural chemicals 
consequently  the company s inland marine transportation business tends to mirror the volumes produced by the company s petrochemical and refining customer base  while the company s coastal marine transportation business tends to mirror the general performance of the united states economy 
the results include the operations of k sea  acquired on july   and described below

the company s inland petrochemical and black oil products fleets achieved tank barge utilization levels in the low to mid range during diesel fuel prices for increased compared with  thereby positively impacting marine transportation revenue as fuel is escalated and de escalated through revenue adjustment clauses in customers term contracts  or the customer pays for the fuel 
marine transportation revenues for were negatively impacted by the high water and flooding during the second quarter as described above  net of certain revenue and cost recovery from contracts with terms that provide reimbursements for delays and increased costs 
for  the company s coastal equipment utilization rate averaged in the mid to high range 
the atlantic  pacific and hawaii fleets experienced higher utilization rates  while the new york harbor fleet reflected a lower utilization rate due to overcapacity of equipment in the bunkering markets 
during  approximately of the inland marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot contract revenues 
time charters  which insulate the company from revenue fluctuations caused by weather and navigational delays and temporary market declines  represented of the inland revenues under term contracts during compared with during inland term contract rates renewed in the first  second  third and fourth quarters increased an average of to  to  to and to  respectively  when compared with term contract rate renewals in the corresponding quarters of spot contract rates in the first quarter  which include the cost of fuel  increased an average of to compared with the fourth quarter and spot market rates for the second quarter increased an average of to compared with the first quarter  partially due to the high water and flooding during the quarter that increased industry wide equipment utilization levels 
spot contracts rates for the third quarter increased an average of to compared with the second quarter 
spot contracts rates for the fourth quarter increased an average of to compared with the third quarter 
effective january   annual escalators for labor and the producer price index on a number of multi year contracts resulted in rate increases on those contracts by to  excluding fuel 

table of contents during  approximately of the coastal marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot contract revenues 
coastal time charters represented approximately of the revenues under term contracts during for the coastal operations  term contracts renewed in the third and fourth quarters were relatively stable compared with contract rates in the third and fourth quarters  while spot contract rates for the third and fourth quarters improved in the to range compared with the prior quarters 
the marine transportation operating margin for was compared with for the higher margin reflected the improved petrochemical and black oil products demand and equipment utilization levels  and higher term contract and spot contract pricing 
these were partially offset by the lower operating margins from the coastal market  by the cost impact of rising diesel fuel prices  by the second quarter loss of revenue and additional operating expenses resulting from the high water and flooding as discussed above  and by the fourth quarter severance charge discussed above 
diesel engine services during  of the company s revenue was generated by its diesel engine services segment  of which was generated from manufacturing  from overhauls and service and from direct parts sales 
the results of the diesel engine services segment are largely influenced by the economic cycles of the marine and power generation markets and the land based pressure pumping and oilfield services industries 
the results include the operations of united  acquired on april   and described below 
during  the distributorship with emd providing replacement parts and service to the shortline  industrial  class ii and certain transit railroads was terminated 
the following table shows the markets serviced by the company  the revenue distribution for  and the customers for each market markets serviced revenue distribution customers land based land based oilfield services  oil and gas operators and producers  compression  on highway transportation marine inland river carriers dry and liquid  offshore towing dry and liquid  offshore oilfield services drilling rigs supply boats  harbor towing  dredging  great lakes ore carriers power generation standby power generation  pumping stations railroad passenger transit systems  class ii  shortline  industrial the company s diesel engine services segment s revenue and operating income increased and  respectively  compared with the increases primarily reflected the acquisition of united on april   as united benefited from the strong demand for the manufacture and service of hydraulic fracturing equipment to meet the increased north american shale gas and crude oil production  and from the sale and service of transmissions and diesel engines and manufacture of compression systems 
in addition  the increase in revenues and operating income reflected a strong medium speed power generation market with engine generator set upgrade projects and higher parts and engine sales and the improved inland liquid and dry marine markets  partially offset by continued weak service levels and direct parts sales in both the medium speed and high speed gulf coast oil services market 
the diesel engine services segment s operating margin for was compared with for the operating margin reflected higher than historical operating margin for united  primarily the result of the higher volume leverage 

table of contents cash flow and capital expenditures the company continued to generate strong operating cash flows during with net cash provided by operating activities of  compared with net cash provided by operating activities for of  the increase for was primarily from higher net earnings attributable to kirby  higher depreciation and amortization and a higher deferred tax provision in versus  partially offset by a larger net decrease in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of  primarily due to increased receivables and inventories associated with the stronger business activity levels and a larger pension contribution in compared to in addition  during and  the company generated cash of  and  respectively  from the exercise of stock options  and  and  respectively  from proceeds from the disposition of assets 
for  cash generated  borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility  the new term loan  and cash and cash equivalents were used for capital expenditures of  including  for inland tank barge and towboat construction   for progress payments on the construction of two offshore articulated dry bulk barge and tugboat units scheduled for completion in  and  primarily for upgrading the existing marine transportation fleet  and  for acquisitions of businesses and marine equipment 
the company s debt to capitalization ratio increased to at december  from at december   primarily due to borrowing under a new term loan used to purchase k sea and borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility used to purchase united  less the increase in total equity from net earnings attributable to kirby for of  stock issued with a fair value of  in connection with the acquisition of k sea  exercise of stock options and the amortization of unearned equity compensation 
as of december   the company had  outstanding under its revolving credit facility and  outstanding under the term loan  of which  was classified as current portion of long term debt 
during  the company took delivery of inland tank barges with a total capacity of approximately  barrels and one inland towboat 
during  the company retired inland tank barges  reducing its capacity by approximately  barrels 
the company projects that capital expenditures for will be in the  to  range  including approximately  for the construction of inland tank barges and five inland towboats and approximately  in progress payments on the construction of two offshore articulated dry bulk barge and tugboat units for delivery in the fourth quarter with an estimated total cost of  for each unit 
outlook petrochemical and black oil products inland tank barge utilization levels continued to improve during  reaching the highest utilization levels  in the low to mid range  since the third quarter of while the united states economy remains sluggish  with consistently high unemployment levels and weak consumer confidence  the united states petrochemical industry has seen a steady improvement in production for both domestic consumption and exports 
lower priced domestic natural gas  a basic feedstock for the united states petrochemical industry  provides the industry with a competitive advantage against foreign petrochemical producers 
as a result  united states petrochemical production improved during the and years  thereby producing increased marine transportation volumes for basic petrochemicals to both domestic consumers and terminals for export destinations 
the black oil products market also continued to improve during  primarily due to a stable united states refinery utilization level aided by the export of diesel fuel and heavy fuel oil  refinery maintenance issues and new demand for the transportation of crude oil from shale formations in south texas  as well as an increase in the movement of canadian crude oil from the midwest to the gulf coast 
the coastal liquid trade is more reflective of the weaker united states economy with refined products volumes below the highs 

table of contents the united states petrochemical industry is globally competitive based on a number of factors including a highly integrated and efficient transportation system of pipelines  railroads  trucks and tank barges  a largely depreciated yet well maintained and operated facilities  and a low cost feedstock slate  which includes natural gas 
certain united states producers have announced plans for plant capacity expansions and the reopening of idled petrochemical facilities 
the current increased production volumes from the company s petrochemical customers have resulted in the company s inland tank barge utilization levels in the low to mid range and any increased production from current facilities  plant expansions or the reopening of idled facilities should drive feedstock and production volumes higher  in turn leading to higher tank barge utilization levels and higher term and contract pricing  which could be mitigated by additional tank barge capacity 
during and  the marine transportation segment was negatively impacted by excess industry inland tank barge capacity 
at the end of  the company estimated there were approximately  inland tank barges in the industry fleet  of which approximately were over years old and approximately of those over years old 
given the age profile of the industry inland tank barge fleet  the expectation is that older tank barges will continue to be removed from service and replaced by new barges that will enter the fleet 
during  with the improved demand for inland petrochemical and black oil products tank barges and federal tax incentives on new equipment  the company estimates that approximately inland tank barges were ordered industry wide for delivery throughout  and many older tank barges will be retired  dependent on petrochemical and refinery production levels  crude oil movements and industry wide tank barge utilization levels 
with the acquisition of k sea on july   the marine transportation segment expanded its bulk liquid transportation segment into the united states jones act coastal trade 
k sea s principal customers are united states based refiners  many of which were already customers of the company 
the acquisition extended the company s tank barge service to its customers with coastal marine transportation requirements on the east coast  gulf coast and west coast  as well as in alaska and hawaii 
as of december   the company estimated there were approximately tank barges in the  barrel or less coastal fleet  of which approximately are single hull that will be required to be removed from service by december  the company presently operates three single hull tank barges in the coastal trade  less than of its barrel capacity 
in the diesel engine services segment  the gulf coast oil services market remained depressed during  but with the recent issuance of gulf of mexico drilling permits should show a slow improvement during the year as drilling activity increases 
with the acquisition of united on april   the segment entered the land based diesel engine and transmission services business 
united manufactures oilfield service equipment  including hydraulic fracturing units and services their components  which include high speed diesel engines  transmissions and pumps  many of the same components used by marine customers 
at the date of the acquisition of united  an estimated million horsepower was employed in the north american hydraulic fracturing business  with significant additional horsepower forecast to be added in the future 
as of december   an estimated million horsepower was employed in the north american hydraulic fracturing business 
although the high level of installed horsepower could slow the demand for newly manufactured units  it does provide an opportunity for remanufacturing and services to existing horsepower 
united is well positioned to benefit from a strong land based services market going forward 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on a combination of historical information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the particular circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates based on different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are 
table of contents described below 
it is also suggested that the company s significant accounting policies  as described in the company s financial statements in note  summary of significant accounting policies  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable 
the company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business 
the company regularly reviews its accounts and estimates the amount of uncollectible receivables each period and establishes an allowance for uncollectible amounts 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the current financial strength of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
historically  credit risk with respect to these trade receivables has generally been considered minimal because of the financial strength of the company s customers  however  the current united states and global recession could impact the collectability of certain customers trade receivables which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
property  maintenance and repairs 
property is recorded at cost 
improvements and betterments are capitalized as incurred 
depreciation is recorded on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets 
when property items are retired  sold or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included in the statement of earnings 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment by vessel class whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
the assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to  estimated fair market value of the assets and estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used  and estimated salvage values 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
goodwill 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in transactions accounted for as a purchase are included in goodwill 
management monitors the recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary 
the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is typically measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the company s average weighted cost of capital 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
accrued insurance 
the company is subject to property damage and casualty risks associated with operating vessels carrying large volumes of bulk liquid and dry cargo in a marine environment 
the company maintains insurance coverage against these risks subject to a deductible  below which the company is liable 
in addition to expensing claims below the deductible amount as incurred  the company also maintains a reserve for losses that may have occurred but have not been reported to the company  or are not yet fully developed 
the company uses historic experience and actuarial analysis by outside consultants to estimate an appropriate level of reserves 
if the actual number of claims and magnitude were substantially greater than assumed  the required level of reserves for claims incurred but not reported or fully developed could be materially understated 
the company records receivables from its insurers for incurred claims above the company s deductible 
if the solvency of the insurers became impaired  there could be an adverse impact on the accrued receivables and the availability of insurance 

table of contents acquisitions on december   the company completed the purchase of the coastal tank barge fleet of seaboats  consisting of three  barrel coastal tank barges and tugboats for  in cash

marine transportation the company  through its marine transportation segment  is a provider of marine transportation services  operating tank barges and towing vessels  transporting bulk liquid products throughout the mississippi river system  on the gulf intracoastal waterway  and along all three united states coasts and in alaska and hawaii 
the company transports petrochemical  black oil products  refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals by tank barge 
as of december   the company operated inland tank barges  with a total capacity of million barrels  compared with inland tank barges at december   with a total capacity of million barrels 
the company operated an average of inland towboats during and during the company s coastal fleet as of december  consisted of tank barges  three of which are single hull  with million barrels of capacity  and tugboats 
the company owns and operates four offshore dry bulk barge and tugboats engaged in the coastal transportation of dry bulk cargoes 
the company also owns a two thirds interest in osprey  which transports project cargoes and cargo containers by barge  as well as a interest in a shifting operation and fleeting facility for dry cargo barges and tank barges on the houston ship channel

table of contents compared with marine transportation revenues marine transportation revenues for increased compared with  reflecting the expansion into the coastal transportation business with the acquisition of k sea on july  k sea contributed approximately of marine transportation revenues 
the increase also reflected strong united states petrochemical production levels and stable refinery production levels  resulting in equipment utilization levels in the low to mid range for the inland petrochemical and black oil products fleets  as well as favorable term and spot contract pricing 
in addition  average diesel fuel prices for increased compared with  positively impacting marine transportation revenues since fuel price increases are covered by fuel escalation and de escalation clauses in the company s term contracts  or the customer pays for the fuel 
marine transportation revenues for the second quarter were negatively impacted from high water and flooding throughout the mississippi river system and along the gulf intracoastal waterway in the morgan city area  net of certain revenues and cost recovery from contracts with terms that provide reimbursements for delays 
the petrochemical market  the company s largest market  contributed of the marine transportation revenues for throughout  petrochemical demand reflected a continued improvement in business levels with some modest decline in demand reported in the fourth quarter 
lower priced natural gas  a basic feedstock for the united states petrochemical industry  provided the industry with a competitive advantage against foreign petrochemical producers 
as a result  united states petrochemical production continued to improve during  producing increased marine transportation volumes for the movement of basic petrochemicals for both domestic consumers and terminals for export destinations 
the black oil products market  which contributed of marine transportation revenues  also saw demand improve during  driven by the continued steady refinery production levels  the export of heavy fuel oil  refinery maintenance activity  new demand for crude oil transportation from the eagle ford shale formations in south texas and increased demand for the movement of canadian crude oil downriver from the midwest to the gulf coast 
the refined petroleum products market  which contributed of marine transportation revenues  reflected continued lower demand for movements of products both inland and coastal  consistent with prevailing conditions in the united states economy  partially offset by an improvement of river ethanol volumes 
k sea  which primarily transports refined petroleum  saw equipment utilization rates in the mid to high  with the atlantic  pacific and hawaii fleets experiencing higher rates  partially offset by lower utilization rates in new york harbor due to overcapacity of equipment in the bunkering markets 
the agricultural chemical market  which contributed of marine transportation revenues  reflected an early midwest spring fill in the first quarter  a very weak second quarter as the spring midwest inventory fill was curtailed due to the heavy rain and flooding which reduced farmers ability to apply fertilizer  and a favorable fall fill late in the third quarter and during portions of the fourth quarter 
for  the inland operations of the marine transportation segment incurred  delay days  more than the  delay days that occurred during delay days measure the lost time incurred by a tow towboat and one or more tank barges during transit when the tow is stopped due to weather  lock conditions and other navigational factors 
the first quarter delay days reflected more severe winter weather conditions  including ice  fog and high water conditions during portions of the quarter 
the second quarter experienced record high water and flooding throughout the mississippi river system and a portion of the gulf intracoastal waterway near morgan city 
the third and fourth quarters reflected more normal weather conditions and water levels 
this compares with the quarters that experienced more normal weather conditions and water levels 
the higher first and second quarter delay days led to increased operating expenses compared with the comparable quarters of

for the fourth quarter  spot contract rates increased an average of to compared with the third quarter 
effective january   annual escalators for labor and the producer price index on a number of inland operation multi year contracts resulted in rate increases on those contracts by to  excluding fuel 
for the coastal operations  term contracts renewed in the third and fourth quarters were relatively stable compared with contract rate renewals in the third and fourth quarters and spot contract rates during the third and fourth quarters improved in the to range compared with the prior quarters 
marine transportation costs and expenses costs and expenses for increased compared with costs of sales and operating expenses for increased compared with  partially reflecting the k sea acquisition  as well as higher costs and expenses due to improved inland operations demand and higher diesel fuel costs 
in addition  unfavorable winter weather and operating conditions during the first quarter and high water and flooding throughout the mississippi river system during the second quarter contributed to increased operating expenses for the inland operations of the marine transportation segment operated an average of towboats during  of which an average of were chartered  compared with during  of which an average of were chartered 
the average includes the towboats and tugboats purchased in the enterprise and kinder morgan acquisitions 
the increase in the number of towboats operated was a reflection of the higher tank barge utilization levels in the petrochemical and black oil products markets during and additional towboats chartered during the second quarter due to the high water and flooding and restrictions placed on the industry regarding tow sizes and horsepower requirements  and assist towboat requirements at bridges  locks  certain sections of affected waterways and barge fleeting areas 
as demand increases or decreases  the company charters in or releases chartered towboats in an effort to balance horsepower needs with current requirements 
the company has historically used chartered towboats for approximately one third of its horsepower requirements 
during  the marine transportation segment consumed million gallons of diesel fuel compared to million gallons consumed during the average price per gallon of diesel fuel consumed during 
table of contents was  an increase of compared with per gallon for fuel escalation and de escalation clauses are designed to rebate fuel costs when prices decline and recover additional fuel costs when fuel prices rise  however  there is generally a to day delay before the contracts are adjusted 
spot contracts do not have escalators for fuel 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased compared with  reflecting the second half expenses of k sea  higher incentive compensation and the  severance charge associated with the integration of k sea into the company 
the year included a retirement and shore staff reduction charge of depreciation and amortization for increased compared with the increases were primarily attributable to the k sea acquisition  increased capital expenditures  including new inland tank barges and towboats  and the acquisition in february of tank barges and towboats and tugboats from enterprise and one towboat from kinder morgan 
marine transportation operating income and operating margins the marine transportation operating income for increased compared with the operating margin was compared with for the higher operating income and operating margin were a reflection of higher inland tank barge utilization in the petrochemical and black oil products markets  and higher inland term and spot contract rates negotiated throughout in addition  the higher operating income reflected the operating income of k sea since the july  acquisition date 
the operating margin was partially offset by a lower operating margin from k sea  the second quarter impact of the high water and flooding and  severance charge as discussed above 
compared with marine transportation revenues marine transportation revenues for increased compared with  reflecting an improvement in tank barge demand and equipment utilization levels in the company s petrochemical and black oil markets  primarily due to the continued modest improvement in production volumes from united states petrochemical plants throughout  and the export of diesel fuel and black oil products produced at united states refineries 
in addition  diesel fuel prices for increased compared with  thereby positively impacting marine transportation revenues since fuel price increases are covered by fuel escalation and de escalation clauses in the company s term contracts 
the petrochemical market  the company s largest market  contributed of the marine transportation revenue for throughout  petrochemical transportation demand reflected a continued improvement in business levels 
lower priced domestic natural gas  a basic feedstock for the united states petrochemical industry  provided the industry with a competitive advantage against foreign petrochemical producers 
as a result  united states petrochemical production improved as the year progressed  thereby producing increased marine transportation volumes for basic petrochemicals to both domestic consumers and terminals for export destinations 
as a result of the higher volumes  the company s petrochemical tank barge fleet s utilization level was in the high range during the majority of the first quarter s improvement in the utilization level was also attributable to supply chain disruptions caused by petrochemical turnarounds and unscheduled plant maintenance 
the black oil products market  which contributed of marine transportation revenue  saw lower utilization of the fleet  as well as a heavy shipyard maintenance cycle for black oil barges during the first half 
during the second half  a heavy united states refinery maintenance schedule which required additional black oil shipments between refineries  coupled with the export of diesel fuel and heavy fuel oil  resulted in the company s black oil fleet maintaining a high range utilization level
