item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included in item of this annual report and the risk factors discussed under item a risk factors 

table of contents overview we are a real estate investment and finance company that was organized in june primarily to acquire  originate and manage a diversified portfolio of real estate related debt instruments 
we focus primarily on acquiring  originating and managing commercial mortgage loans  which may be performing  sub performing or non performing loans including loan to own strategies  and other commercial real estate related debt investments 
we also have acquired and may continue to acquire other real estate and real estate related assets 
we collectively refer to commercial mortgage loans  other commercial real estate related debt investments  cmbs  reo properties and other real estate and real estate related assets as our target assets 
see business our target assets 
we elected to be taxed as a reit for us federal income tax purposes  commencing with our initial taxable year ended december  we also intend to continue to operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the act 
business objective and outlook our objective is to provide attractive risk adjusted returns to our investors through a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate debt and other debt and real estate related investments  including reo and other special situations 
the total return profile of our investments is composed of both current yield  which is distributed through regular way dividends  and capital appreciation potential  which is distributed through regular way and or special dividends 
our investments typically fall within three general categories loan acquisitions the purchase of performing  sub performing and or non performing commercial real estate debt  often at significant discounts to par  loan originations the origination of structured senior and subordinate debt secured by mortgages and or equity interests in commercial real estate with a bias towards current yield  and special situations other debt and real estate related investments including cmbs  sale leasebacks  triple net lease investments  residential reo  single family homes to be held for investment and rented to tenants  and minority equity interests in banks 
our investments are diversified across a wide spectrum of commercial real estate property types office  industrial  retail  multifamily and hospitality and geographically  with investments across the united states and europe 
significant dislocation has occurred in global real estate credit markets since the financial downturn  and while the market has begun the process of recovery  we continue to find opportunities where financial assets are mispriced relative to intrinsic value of the underlying collateral 
we believe the recovery will occur in two general phases phase one will involve many loan acquisition opportunities as financial institutions around the globe deleverage and divest of troubled assets  and phase two will involve an increasing number of loan originations as commercial real estate fundamentals continue to stabilize and commercial real estate assets are refinanced with new capital based on revised underwriting  valuation and operating metrics 
we believe phases one and two are actively underway in the united states  whereas europe is lagging and is currently producing mostly loan acquisition opportunities 
we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on such opportunities sourcing transactions through the numerous relationships enjoyed by our manager through its two decade history in the real estate investment business 
we also believe that our manager s in depth understanding of commercial real estate and real estate related investments including our target assets  and in house underwriting and asset management capabilities  enable us to acquire assets with attractive risk adjusted return profiles and the potential for meaningful capital appreciation 
recent developments investment activities during the year ended december   we invested approximately million in thirteen new assets and million to increase our interests in existing investments

some of the loans in our investment portfolio are in the process of being restructured or may otherwise be under credit watch or at risk 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
if we determine that it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts according to the terms of a particular loan agreement  we could be required to recognize an impairment charge or a loss on the loan 
if our assumptions regarding  among other things  the present value of expected future cash flows or the value of the collateral securing our loans are incorrect or general economic and financial conditions cause a significant number of borrowers to become unable to make payments under their loans  we could be required to recognize significant impairment charges  which could result in a material reduction in earnings and distributions in the period in which the loans are determined to be impaired 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  and for which the impact of changes in estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements 
the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that we believe are critical based on the nature of our operations  and applies to both the company and our unconsolidated joint ventures 
we believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made  based upon information available to us at that time 
this discussion is intended to supplement the description of our significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures many of our investments have been structured as joint ventures with one or more co investment funds pursuant to an investment allocation agreement see business co investment funds 
the joint ventures are generally capitalized through equity contributions from the members  although certain investments are leveraged through various financing arrangements 
our exposure to the joint ventures is limited to amounts invested or committed to the joint ventures at inception  and neither we nor the other investors are required to provide financial or other support in excess of their capital commitments 

table of contents in some cases these joint ventures are considered to be variable interest entities vies 
generally  a vie is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics a the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  b as a group  the holders of the equity investment at risk lack i the power  through voting rights or similar rights  to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its financial performance  ii the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity  or iii the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity  or c the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve  or are conducted on behalf of  an investor including its related parties that has disproportionately few voting rights 
in certain circumstances  we hold of the voting rights to elect the board of directors of the joint venture  but own varying economic interests  which currently range from to 
in other cases  our voting rights are proportional to our economic interests  however the joint ventures are subject to management or other contracts that create vies 
gaap requires a vie to be consolidated in the financial statements of the entity that is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 
the primary beneficiary generally is the entity that has both the following characteristics i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact its economic performance  and ii the obligation to absorb expected losses of  or the right to receive benefits from  the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
we have analyzed each of the joint ventures and determined that either they are not vies and we do not have a controlling financial interest  or they are vies but we are not the primary beneficiary 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we consider qualitative and quantitative factors  including  but not limited to the amount and characteristics of our investment  the obligation or likelihood that we or other investors will be required to provide financial support  our and the other investors ability to control or significantly influence key decisions for the vie  and the similarity and significance of the vie s business activities to our and the other investors business activities 
significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair values and performance of assets held by the vies and general market conditions 
since we are not required to consolidate the joint ventures  we account for our investments in joint ventures using the equity method 
we initially record investments in unconsolidated joint ventures at cost and adjust for our proportionate share of net earnings or losses  cash contributions made and distributions received  and other adjustments  as appropriate 
distributions of operating profit from joint ventures are reported as part of operating cash flows on our statement of cash flows 
distributions related to a capital transaction  such as a refinancing transaction or sale  are reported as investing activities on our statement of cash flows 
we perform a quarterly evaluation of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures to determine whether the fair value of our interest in each joint venture is less than the carrying value  and  if such decrease in value deemed to be is other than temporary  we write down our investment to fair value 
loans receivable and interest income recognition we originate and purchase loans receivable 
originated loans are recorded at amortized cost  or the upb less net deferred loan fees 
net deferred loan fees include unamortized origination and other fees charged to the borrower less direct incremental loan origination costs we incurred 
purchased loans are recorded at amortized cost  or the upb less unamortized purchase discount 
costs to purchase loans are expensed as incurred 
interest income is recognized based upon the contractual rate and the outstanding principal balance of the loans 
purchase discount or net deferred loan fees are amortized over the expected life of the loans using the effective yield method except on revolving loans  for which the straight line method is used 
past due loans we places loans on nonaccrual status when any portion of principal or interest is more than days past due  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal or interest 
when 
table of contents we place a loan on nonaccrual status  we reverse the accrual for unpaid interest and do not recognize interest income until we receive cash and the loan returns to accrual status 
generally  a loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest are brought current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and the borrower has met certain performance criteria 
impairment we evaluate our loans for impairment on a quarterly basis 
we regularly analyze the extent and effect of any credit migration from underwriting and the initial investment review associated with a loan s performance and or value of underlying collateral as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower sponsor 
specifically  a property s operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess i whether cash from operations are sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future  ii the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan  and or iii the property s liquidation value 
where applicable  we also evaluate the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower s competency in managing and operating the properties 
a loan is considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a loan is also considered to be impaired if it has been restructured in a troubled debt restructuring tdr involving a modification of terms as a concession resulting from the debtor s financial difficulties 
we measure impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if the loan valuation is less than the recorded investment in the loan  a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding charge to allowance for loan loss 
acquired credit distressed loans we acquire credit distressed loans for which we expect to collect less than the contractual amounts due under the terms of the loan based  at least in part  on the assessment of the credit quality of the borrower 
acquired credit distressed loans are recorded at the initial investment in the loans and accreted to the estimated cash flows expected to be collected measured at acquisition date 
the excess of cash flows expected to be collected measured at acquisition date over the initial investment accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the effective interest method 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected are recognized prospectively through adjustment of yield over the remaining life of the loan 
decreases in cash flows expected to be collected result in a charge to provision for loan losses 
the excess of contractually required payments at the acquisition date over expected cash flows nonaccretable difference is not recognized as an adjustment of yield  loss accrual or valuation allowance 
acquired credit distressed loans may be aggregated into pools based upon common risk characteristics  such as loan performance  collateral type and or geographic location of the collateral 
once a loan pool is identified  a composite yield and estimate of cash flows expected to be collected including expected prepayments are used to recognize interest income 
a loan resolution within a loan pool  which may involve the sale of the loan or foreclosure on the underlying collateral  results in removal of the loan at an allocated carrying amount that preserves the yield of the pool 
a loan modified in a tdr within a loan pool remains in the loan pool  with the effect of the modification incorporated into the expected future cash flows 
fair value measurement we determine the estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level prices are determined using other significant observable inputs 
observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing a security 
these may include quoted prices for similar securities  interest rates  prepayment speeds  credit risk and others 
level prices are determined using significant unobservable inputs 
in situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable for example  when there is little or no market activity for an investment at the end of the period  unobservable inputs may be used 

table of contents we record certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis when required by gaap 
examples of financial instruments we own that are required by gaap to be carried at fair value are derivative instruments and debt securities designated as available for sale 
we have not elected the fair value option for financial instruments not required to be carried at fair value by gaap 
we carry those financial instruments at amortized cost and separately disclose the fair value on a quarterly basis 
these instruments are recorded at fair value only if they are impaired 
in cases where quoted market prices are not available  fair values are estimated using inputs such as discounted cash flow projections  market comparables  dealer quotes and other quantitative and qualitative factors 
the fair values of foreign exchange contracts are determined by discounting the expected cash flow of each instrument based on forecast foreign exchange rates 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives  observable market based inputs  and credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect the non performance risk for both the company and the respective counterparty 
the fair value of debt securities and loans are generally determined by discounting the expected cash flows using observable current and forward rates of applicable published indices 
fair values of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are primarily derived by applying our ownership interest to the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of each joint venture 
our proportionate share of each joint venture s fair value approximates our fair value of the investment as the timing of cash flows of the joint venture does not deviate materially from the timing of cash flows we receive from the joint venture

table of contents income from our investments our primary source of income is our investments in loans  which we hold either directly or through our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures

the remaining investment expenses include the cost of managing and servicing our investments and investment transaction costs expensed in connection with the initial acquisition of our investments  as well as costs associated with unsuccessful transactions 

table of contents interest expense interest expense for the years ended december  and of million and  respectively  includes million and  respectively  of contractual interest  unused commitment fees and amortization of deferred financing costs on our credit facility 
interest expense for related to our credit facility was significantly higher due primarily to three factors higher average outstanding balance in  particularly in the latter half of the year  in order to finance our investments  a full year s effect of amortization of deferred financing costs and unused commitment fees as our original credit facility was obtained in september  and higher unused commitment fees due to a million increase in total availability post september restructuring

professional fees for increased  or  over primarily due to higher legal and tax fees incurred for ongoing consultations related to compliance  transaction structuring  reit specific tax issues and other regulatory matters  and overhead expenses allocated from colony capital increased  or  as a result of an increase in the ratio of our total assets to total colony capital managed assets 
the increase in total administrative expenses was partially offset by the following compensation expense decreased  or  due to a lower annual bonus amount for our chief financial officer  and a reduction of coverage in our insurance programs in may resulted in lower insurance costs for subsequent periods 
the majority of administrative expenses for the period from june  date of inception to december  was incurred after our ipo in september the overall increase in administrative expenses for the year ended december  over the post ipo period in generally reflects the effects of a full year s operations as compared to only about one fiscal quarter s operations in compensation expense 
table of contents was higher in compared to the annualized expense due to a cash bonus of million paid to our chief financial officer 
the amount allocated to us by colony capital for the partial period was  professional fees were higher in compared to the annualized expense due to our investment fees incurred for third party internal audit services in to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting to meet the section requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of no internal audit costs were incurred in tax and legal fees were also higher in compared to the annualized expense due to increased investment and corporate activities as we ramped up our operations 
income tax provision our trss  which directly or indirectly hold certain of our investments  are subject to corporate level federal  state  foreign and local income taxes 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded an income tax provision of million and  respectively 
the income tax provision reflects current income taxes payable on the operations of our trss and an unrealized gain recognized on a foreign investment  net of a deferred tax benefit resulting from temporary differences related to income recognition for our foreign joint ventures and the db and cushman adc fdic portfolios

our current primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand  our credit facility  cash flow generated from our investments  both from operations and return of capital  proceeds from full or partial realization of investments  investment level financing  and proceeds from public or private equity offerings 
we believe that our capital resources are sufficient to meet our short term and long term capital requirements 
however  because of distribution requirements imposed on us to qualify as a reit  which generally require that we distribute to our stockholders of our taxable income  our ability to finance our growth must largely be funded by external sources of capital 
as a result  in order to continue investing in our target assets and sustain our growth  we will have to rely on third party sources of capital  including public and private offerings of securities and debt financings  which may or may not be available on favorable terms  or at all

pursuant to the operating agreements of three of our unconsolidated joint ventures  the members may be required to fund additional amounts for customary and ordinary operating costs of the joint ventures 
our share of those commitments is million 
wlh investor had committed million to wlh under the dip loan in order to support wlh s operations and ensure adequate liquidity during the pendency of its chapter case see our investments wlh secured loan 
our proportionate share of the commitment  net of cash on hand of million at wlh investor as of december   was approximately million 
wlh emerged from bankruptcy in february  thereby terminating the dip loan and eliminating our commitment to fund future draws 
the table above does not include the secured financing on grand  which is recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet  as we are not obligated to repurchase the a note participation interest 
the table also does not reflect amounts due under our management agreement or derivative instruments as those contracts do not have fixed and determinable payments 
off balance sheet arrangements we have ownership interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
for three structured transactions with the fdic  we and certain investment funds managed by affiliates of our manager committed to contribute additional amounts in order to satisfy additional security requirements  up to amounts set forth in the transaction documents with the fdic 
all such obligations are included in the contractual obligations table above 
for the remaining four structured transactions with the fdic  such additional security requirements were funded at closing and no additional commitments exist 
with the exception of the seven structured transactions with the fdic  the unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest currently do not employ leverage 
the structured transactions with the fdic are leveraged with zero coupon financing provided by the fdic with terms ranging from two to seven years 
the loans are not guaranteed by the managing member entities in which we have ownership interests and are non recourse to us 
acquisitions of target assets during the year ended december   we invested approximately million in thirteen new target assets and million to increase our interests in existing investments 
we expect to continue to pursue our target assets in and may invest additional funds in our existing investments 
to the extent that we do not generate sufficient cash from our operations  we expect to fund our investments with borrowings from our credit facility  investment level financing  redeployment of proceeds from realized investments and public or private issuance of equity 
dividends us federal income tax law generally requires that a reit distribute annually at least of its reit taxable income  without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains  and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than of its net taxable income 
we intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders in an amount equal to our net taxable income  if and to the extent authorized by our board of directors 
before we pay any dividend  whether for us federal income tax purposes or otherwise  we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service  if any 
in 
table of contents addition  our amended credit facility limits the annual amount of distributions we can make to the greater of i of our net income adjusted by any non cash impairment charges  write downs or losses and ii of our taxable income 
if our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income  we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities 
we have made regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock beginning with our first full fiscal quarter ended december  during the years ended december  and  we declared dividends of per share and per share  respectively  which represents a year over year increase 
we generally declare dividends in the last month of each fiscal quarter and pay them in the following month 
cash and cash flows as of march   we had approximately million of cash on hand 
the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented year ended december  period from june  date of inception to in thousands december  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities operating activities for the years ended december  and  cash flows from operating activities increased million  or 
the increase reflects the substantial increase in the number of investments in our investment portfolio 
cash flows from operating activities are primarily distributions of earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures and interest received from our investments in loans  partially offset by payment of operating expenses 
for the period from june  date of inception to december   net cash used in operating activities was for the payment of our administrative expenses 
investing activities since the closing of our ipo  we have been actively investing in our target assets 
net cash used in investing activities for all periods presented reflect our investing activity 
cash outlays for our contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures and for investments in loans during the periods are partially offset by distributions of capital from unconsolidated joint ventures 
financing activities for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities reflects net proceeds from the common stock offering  net borrowings of million under our credit facility as well as a million contribution from noncontrolling interest for the manhattan landmark buildings loan 
these amounts are offset by the payment of dividends  common stock repurchases and payment of costs related to the restructuring of our credit facility 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities reflect approximately million of proceeds from the private placement  net borrowings of million on our credit facility and million received in grand a note participation  offset by dividends paid to common stockholders and payment of costs in connection with our credit facility 
for the period from june  date of inception to december   nearly all of net cash provided by financing activities represents the net cash proceeds from our ipo and concurrent private placement 

table of contents credit facility our current primary source of liquidity is our credit facility 
on september   we amended our existing credit agreement with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  and certain lenders 
the credit agreement provides a credit facility in the initial maximum principal amount of million  which may be increased to million  under certain conditions set forth in the credit agreement  including each lender or substitute lenders agreeing to provide commitments for such increased amount 
borrowings under the credit agreement will be used to finance investments in our target assets  as well as for general corporate purposes 
the amount available for draw is limited to times the annualized cash income as defined in the credit agreement from eligible assets 
to be included in the borrowing capacity  an asset must meet certain criteria  including being free of all liens and pledges and  when taken with all other eligible assets  the average time to maturity must be at least years 
the maximum amount available for draw as of march  was million  of which million was drawn 
the credit agreement contains covenants and restrictions requiring us to meet certain financial ratios and reporting requirements 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants and we expect to continue to meet all financial and reporting requirements 
however  in the event of an economic slow down  volatility in the credit markets  and rising cost of capital  there is no certainly that we will be able to continue to meet all of the covenant requirements 
the following table summarizes the key financial covenants and our actual results as of and for the three months ended december  in thousands covenant level actual level december  financial covenant as defined in the credit agreement consolidated tangible net worth minimum   consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio minimum to to consolidated leverage ratio maximum to to liquidity minimum   total facility outstandings to consolidated cash income maximum to to weighted average maturity of contributing investment assets minimum months months cash from investments our investments generate cash  either from operations or as a return of our invested capital 
we receive monthly or quarterly distributions from some of our unconsolidated joint ventures from earnings  principal receipts or capital transactions such as financing transactions or loan sales 
we also receive interest and principal on our loans held for investment 
as loans reach their maturity we may receive all or a portion of the outstanding principal balance 
scheduled repayments of loans for the year ending december  are minimal  however  some of our loans require partial paydowns of principal in the event of a sale of the underlying collateral 
we may also  from time to time  fully or partially realize our investments through sales 
for example  during the year ended december   through our interest in a joint venture which holds an ownership interest in first republic bank  we sold  shares of common stock in first republic bank  which resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately million 
we also received approximately million of distributions of capital from our unconsolidated joint ventures resulting from loan resolutions at the joint venture level  either through loan sales or payoffs whether paid in full or discounted 
we expect to continue to resolve loans in some of our loan pools to generate cash  particularly those in acquired credit distressed portfolios  such as the bulls loan portfolio and german loan portfolios 
we may also pursue opportunities to sell whole or partial positions in our originated loan investments or obtain financing see investment level financing to generate cash and improve the total return on our investments 

table of contents investment level financing the structured transactions with the fdic were consummated in part with leverage provided by the fdic 
we also secured investment level financing on our grand loan by assignment of an a note participation and may attempt to secure other investment level financing  if available  including term loans  securitizations  warehouse facilities  repurchase agreements and the issuance of debt and equity securities 
we also expect to continue to invest in a number of our assets through co investments with other investment vehicles managed by affiliates of our manager and or other third parties  which may allow us to pool capital to access larger transactions and diversify investment exposure 
equity offerings our primary source of liquidity during the first three quarters of was the net proceeds from the common stock offering 
during the third quarter of  we fully deployed the net proceeds from the common stock offering to acquire our target assets 
under our current shelf registration statement filed with the sec  we may offer up to billion in various classes of equity securities 
these securities may be issued from time to time at our discretion based on our needs and depending upon market conditions and available pricing 
non gaap supplemental financial measure core earnings core earnings is a non gaap financial measure and is defined as gaap net income loss excluding non cash equity compensation expense  the costs incurred in connection with our formation and our ipo  including the initial and additional underwriting discounts and commissions  the incentive fee  real estate depreciation and amortization to the extent that we foreclose on any properties underlying our target assets and any unrealized gains or losses from mark to market valuation changes other than permanent impairment that are included in net income 
the amount will be adjusted to exclude i one time events pursuant to changes in gaap and ii non cash items which in the judgment of management should not be included in core earnings  which adjustments in clauses i and ii shall only be excluded after discussions between our manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of our independent directors 
we believe that core earnings is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance 
the exclusion from core earnings of the items specified above allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the assets that form the core of our activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
core earnings is also the basis upon which the incentive fee to our manager is calculated and was a key factor in determining the performance hurdle for the reimbursement of our manager s partial payment of the initial underwriting discounts and commissions see business our manager and the management agreement reimbursement of manager s partial payment of ipo underwriting discounts and commissions 
also  as some of our competitors use a similar supplemental measure  it facilitates comparisons of operating performance to other mortgage reits 
however  other mortgage reits may use different methodologies to calculate core earnings  and accordingly  our core earnings may not be comparable to all other mortgage reits 
core earnings does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 

table of contents a reconciliation of our gaap net income attributable to common stockholders to core earnings is presented below year ended december  period from june  date of inception to in thousands december  gaap net income loss attributable to common stockholders adjustment to gaap net income loss to reconcile to core earnings loss noncash equity compensation expense incentive fee net unrealized loss on derivatives inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance more so than inflation  although inflation rates can often have a meaningful influence over the direction of interest rates 
furthermore  our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our distributions are determined by our board of directors primarily based on our taxable income  and  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and or fair market value without considering inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit curve spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and credit risk in our underlying investments 
the primary market risks to which the company is exposed  either directly or indirectly through its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  are credit risk  interest rate risk  credit curve spread risk and foreign currency risk 
credit risk our joint venture investments and loans receivable are subject to a high degree of credit risk 
credit risk is the exposure to loss from loan defaults 
default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  borrower financial condition  property performance  property management  supply demand factors  construction trends  consumer behavior  regional economics  interest rates  the strength of the us economy  and other factors beyond our control 
all loans are subject to a certain probability of default 
we manage credit risk through the underwriting process  acquiring our investments at the appropriate discount to face value  if any  and establishing loss assumptions 
we also carefully monitor the performance of the loans  including those held by the joint ventures  as well as external factors that may affect their value 
for more information  see business risk management 
interest rate and credit curve spread risk interest rate risk relates to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
credit curve spread risk is highly sensitive to the dynamics of the markets for commercial real estate loans and securities we hold 
excessive supply of these assets combined with reduced demand will cause the market to require a higher yield 
this demand for higher yield will cause the market to use a higher spread over the us treasury securities yield curve  or other benchmark interest rates  to 
table of contents value these assets 
the majority of the performing loans held by our unconsolidated joint ventures are fixed rate loans 
as us treasury securities are priced to a higher yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the assets increases  the price at which the joint ventures could sell some of the assets may decline 
conversely  as us treasury securities are priced to a lower yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the assets decreases  the value of the loan portfolios may increase 
in addition  fluctuations in libor rates may affect the amount of interest expense we incur in connection with borrowings under our credit facility  which  based on our current debt ratio  incur interest expense at a per annum rate equal to the sum of  at our election  the one  two  three  six  or twelve month libor plus 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings under the credit facility of million bearing interest at plus one month libor  or a weighted average of 
assuming no changes in the outstanding balance of our existing variable rate debt as of december   a basis point increase in the one month libor would increase our projected annual interest expense by approximately million 
we carry our beneficial interests in debt securities and the associated embedded derivative liability at fair value  which is determined by discounting the expected cash flows using observable current and forward rates of a widely used index that closely follows the sifma municipal swap index 
a basis point increase in the sifma municipal swap index would decrease the fair value of the beneficial interests in debt securities by million and decrease the fair value of the associated liability by million 
as of december   we and our unconsolidated joint ventures did not have any interest rate hedges 
however  in the future  we or our unconsolidated joint ventures may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on our operations 
the use of these types of derivatives to hedge interest earning assets and or interest bearing liabilities carries certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for distribution and that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
a hedge may not perform its intended purpose of offsetting losses of rising interest rates 
moreover  with respect to certain of the instruments used as hedges  we are exposed to the risk that the counterparties with which we trade may cease making markets and quoting prices in such instruments  which may render us unable to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to an open position 
if we anticipate that the income from any such hedging transaction will not be qualifying income for reit income purposes  we may conduct all or part of our hedging activities through a to be formed corporate subsidiary that is fully subject to federal corporate income taxation 
our profitability may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
currency risk we have foreign currency rate exposures related to our equity investments in joint ventures which hold certain commercial real estate loan investments in europe 
our sole currency exposure is to the euro 
changes in currency rates can adversely affect the fair values and earnings of our non us holdings 
as of december   we had approximately million  or million  in european investments 
net tax effected accumulated foreign exchange loss on the european investments was approximately million  or million after hedge gain 
a change in the exchange rate would result in a million increase or decrease in translation gain or loss on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
we mitigate this risk by utilizing currency instruments to hedge the capital portion of our foreign currency risk 
the type of hedging instrument that we employed on our european investments was a costless collar buying a protective put while writing an out of the money covered call with a strike price at which the premium received is equal to the premium of the protective put purchased which involved no initial capital outlay 
the puts were structured with strike prices approximately lower than our cost basis in such investments  thereby limiting any euro related foreign exchange related fluctuations to approximately of the original capital invested in the deal 
at december   we had ten outstanding collars with an aggregate notional amount of approximately million 
the maturity dates of such instruments approximate the projected dates of related cash flows for specific investments 
termination or maturity of currency hedging instruments may result in an obligation for 
table of contents payment to or from the counterparty to the hedging agreement 
during the year ended december   terminations of collars hedging our net foreign investments resulted in a net cash disbursement of  we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by counterparties for these contracts 
to manage this risk  we select major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties and perform a quarterly review of the financial health and stability of our trading counterparties 
based on our review as of december   we do not expect any counterparty to default on its obligations 
the following table summarizes the notional amounts and fair values of our collars as of december  in thousands  except exchange rates hedged asset notional amount cap range usd floor range usd expiration date net fair value investment in colonial investor  december investment in crystal investor june december investment in ford investor  july investment in hunt investor  july july
