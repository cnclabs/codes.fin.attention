item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our current research and or development activities are focused on developing technologies and product candidates to treat cancers and infectious diseases 
our core technology portfolio consists of our saponin platform based on our saponin adjuvant based technologies and our heat shock protein hsp platform based on our hsp based technologies 
some of our key candidates from these technology platforms are qs stimulon adjuvant qs  the prophage series vaccines and herpv 
qs is an adjuvant  or a substance added to a vaccine or other immunotherapy that is intended to enhance immune response 
the key licensees of qs are glaxosmithkline gsk and janssen alzheimer immunotherapy janssen ai 
there are approximately vaccines containing qs in clinical development by our licensees  including a total of four in phase testing for malaria  melanoma  non small cell lung cancer and shingles 
the first products containing qs are anticipated to be launched in the timeframe  and we are entitled to royalties for at least years post launch 
the prophage series vaccines are a patient specific application of our hsp platform 
the prophage series vaccine r is referred to as oncophage vaccine vitespen and is approved in russia for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma rcc  kidney cancer in patients at intermediate risk of recurrence 
in december  we granted newvac llc a subsidiary of chemrar ventures llc an exclusive license to manufacture  market and sell oncophage as well as pursue a development program in the russian federation and certain other cis countries 
in addition  phase trials are underway in the united states testing the prophage series vaccine candidates g and g in newly diagnosed and recurrent glioma  respectively 
also derived from our hsp platform technologies  herpv is a recombinant  synthetic  non patient specific therapeutic vaccine candidate for the treatment of genital herpes 
it has completed phase testing  where it was shown to elicit both cd and cd positive t cell responses a first of its kind finding in genital herpes treatment 
because the product contains multiple antigens derived from the herpes simplex virus hsv  it may be applicable to a broader patient population and may have potential in managing outbreaks and disease transmission 
we consider this to be a platform technology  since with the integration of heat shock proteins with antigenic peptides we could potentially create therapeutic vaccines for various infectious diseases 
we plan to initiate a phase trial during the second half of in addition to our internal development efforts  we continue to pursue partnering opportunities 
we are seeking partners for select products in our portfolio  which include the prophage g series vaccines  g and g  qs  and herpv 
we are also exploring in licensing opportunities 
our business activities have included product research and development  intellectual property prosecution  manufacturing  regulatory and clinical affairs  corporate finance and development  market development  business development  and support of our collaborations 
research and development expenses for the years ended december    and  were million  million  and million  respectively 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity and convertible notes 
we believe that  based on our current plans and activities  our working capital resources at december  and the net proceeds raised from equity sales and license agreements since year end  along with the estimated proceeds from our license  supply  and collaborative agreements  will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements through based on our estimated annual use of cash of million during we expect to attempt to raise additional funds in advance of depleting our funds 
we may attempt to raise additional funds by out licensing technologies or products to one or more third parties  renegotiating third party agreements  selling assets  securing additional debt financing and or selling equity securities 
satisfying long term liquidity needs may require the successful commercialization and or one or more partnering arrangements for our product  oncophage and or our other prophage series vaccines  vaccines containing qs under development by our licensees  and or potentially other product candidates  each of which will require additional capital 

table of contents our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol agen 
in april  we moved from the nasdaq global market to the nasdaq capital market as part of our plan to regain compliance with minimum market value requirements 
on march   we were notified by the listing qualifications staff of nasdaq the staff that we were not in compliance with the minimum bid requirement set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule a the bid price requirement because the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for consecutive business days 
effective october   our certificate of incorporation was amended to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock on the basis of one post split share for every six pre split shares to  in part  regain compliance with the bid price requirement 
on october   we received notice from the nasdaq listing qualifications panel the panel that we had regained compliance with the bid price requirement and otherwise satisfied the requirements for continued listing on nasdaq 
historical results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue we generated revenue of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue includes license fees and royalties earned  and in  revenue earned on shipments of qs to our qs licensees  grants earned and oncophage sales 
in the years ended december  and  we recorded revenue of million and million  respectively  from the amortization of deferred revenue related to our qs partnered programs 
research and development research and development expenses include the costs associated with our internal research and development activities  including compensation and benefits  occupancy costs  clinical manufacturing costs  costs of consultants  and administrative costs 
research and development expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the overall status of our development programs and includes million for amortization and depreciation expense   related to our noncash share based compensation expense  and  related to the reduced production of clinical product to our licensees due to the transfer of manufacturing rights 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  facility expenses  and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is largely due to the status of our development programs and our cost containment efforts and includes  related to our employee and director noncash share based compensation expense   for amortization and depreciation expense  and  for personnel related expenses 
non operating income non operating income of million for the year ended december  consists of a net gain of million on the extinguishment of a portion of our notes and the change in the fair value of our derivative liability since december  of million 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is related to the repurchase of substantially all of our notes during the year ended december  interest on our notes is payable semi annually on december and june in cash or  at our option  in additional notes or a combination thereof 
during the years ended december  and  interest expense included million and million  respectively  paid in the form of additional notes 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue we generated revenue of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue includes revenue earned on shipments of qs to our qs licensees  license fees  royalties earned  and in  grants earned and oncophage sales

table of contents research and development research and development expenses include the costs associated with our internal research and development activities  including compensation and benefits  occupancy costs  clinical manufacturing costs  costs of consultants  and administrative costs 
research and development expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease included declines of million for personnel related expenses and  for facility related costs primarily due to cost containment efforts  and million for various outside services primarily related to the status of our efforts in russia and other territories 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  facility expenses  and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is largely attributable to declines of million for various outside services primarily relating to the status of our efforts in russia and other territories  and  in employee and director noncash share based compensation expense 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is related to the repurchase of a portion of our notes 
interest on our notes is payable semi annually on december and june in cash or  at our option  in additional notes or a combination thereof 
during the years ended december  and  interest expense included million and million  respectively  paid in the form of additional notes 
interest income interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in our average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance coupled with declining interest rates earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
our average interest rate earned decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  research and development programs prior to  we did not track costs on a per project basis  and therefore have estimated the allocation of our total research and development costs to our largest research and development programs for that time period 
during  these research and development programs consisted largely of our prophage series vaccines and qs  as indicated in the following table in thousands 
research and development program product year ended december  prior to total heat shock proteins for cancer prophage series vaccines     heat shock proteins for infectious diseases herpv   vaccine adjuvant qs    other research and development programs total research and development expenses prior to  costs were incurred by aquila biopharmaceuticals  inc  a company we acquired in november research and development program costs include compensation and other direct costs plus an allocation of indirect costs  based on certain assumptions and our review of the status of each program 
our prophage series vaccines are in various stages of development as described below 
significant additional expenditures will be required if we start new trials  encounter delays in our programs  apply for regulatory approvals  continue 
table of contents development of our technologies  expand our operations  and or bring our product candidates to market 
the eventual total cost of each clinical trial is dependent on a number of factors such as trial design  length of the trial  number of clinical sites  and number of patients 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new therapeutic products is lengthy  expensive  and uncertain 
because the further development of our prophage series vaccines is subject to evaluation and uncertainty  and because herpv is an early stage clinical development candidate  we are unable to reliably estimate the cost of completing our research and development programs  the timing of bringing such programs to various markets  and  therefore  when  if ever  material cash inflows are likely to commence 
programs involving qs depend on our collaborative partners or licensees successfully completing clinical trials  successfully manufacturing qs to meet demand  obtaining regulatory approvals and successfully commercializing product candidates containing qs product development portfolio qs qs stimulon adjuvant  from our saponin platform  is an adjuvant  or a substance added to a vaccine or other immunotherapy  that is intended to enhance immune response 
the key licensees of qs are gsk and janssen ai 
there are vaccines containing qs in clinical development  including a total of four in phase testing for malaria  melanoma  non small cell lung cancer and shingles 
the first products containing qs are anticipated to be launched in the timeframe 
the pipeline of product candidates containing qs is extraordinarily diverse  encompassing prophylactic as well as therapeutic vaccines for infectious diseases  multiple cancer types  and alzheimer s disease 
the company does not incur clinical development costs for these products 
for additional information regarding qs  please read part i item business of this annual report on form k 
prophage series vaccines we started enrolling patients in our first clinical trial studying a prophage series vaccine at memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york  new york in november to date  nearly cancer patients have been treated with our vaccine in clinical trials 
because prophage series vaccines are novel therapeutic vaccines that are patient specific  meaning derived from the patient s own tumor  they are experiencing a long development process and high development costs  either of which could delay or prevent our commercialization efforts 
for additional information regarding regulatory risks and uncertainties  please read the risks identified under part i item a 
risk factors of this annual report on form k 
we believe that the collective results from clinical trials thus far show that the vaccine candidates that have been clinically evaluated have a favorable safety profile 
we also believe that available results from clinical trials suggest that treatment with the prophage series vaccines can generate immunological and anti tumor responses

liquidity and capital resources we have incurred annual operating losses since inception  and we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we expect to incur significant losses over the next several years as we continue clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  prepare for commercialization  and continue development of our technologies 
we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity and convertible notes  and interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances 
from our inception through december   we have raised aggregate net proceeds of million through the sale of common and preferred stock  the exercise of stock options and warrants  proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan  and the issuance of convertible notes 
during february  we entered into an at the market sales agreement the atm with mcnicoll  lewis vlak llc and wm smith co the sales agents under which we were able to sell an aggregate of up to  shares of our common stock from 
table of contents time to time through the sales agents 
as of february   we issued approximately million shares of our common stock in at the market offerings through the sales agents and raised net proceeds of approximately million after deducting offering costs of approximately  as of december   we had debt outstanding of million in principal  including million in principal of our notes maturing august  and  in principal of our notes maturing february  the notes are currently redeemable by us or at the option of the holders on february  and our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments at december  were million  a decrease of million from december  we believe that  based on our current plans and activities  our cash balance of million as of december   plus the million net proceeds from equity offerings and license agreements since year end  along with the estimated additional proceeds from our license  supply  and collaborative agreements will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements through based on our estimated annual use of cash of million during we continue to monitor the likelihood of success of our key initiatives and are prepared to discontinue funding of such activities if they do not prove to be feasible  restrict capital expenditures and or reduce the scale of our operations 
we believe that  based on our current plans and activities  our working capital resources at december  and the net proceeds raised from equity sales and license agreements since year end  along with the estimated proceeds from our license  supply  and collaborative agreements  will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements into we closely monitor our cash needs 
we continue to monitor the likelihood of success of our key initiatives and are prepared to discontinue funding of such activities if they do not prove to be commercially feasible 
in addition  we will continue to adjust other spending as needed in order to preserve liquidity 
we expect to attempt to raise additional funds in advance of depleting our current funds 
in order to fund our operations through and beyond  we will need to contain costs and raise additional funds 
we may attempt to raise additional funds by out licensing technologies or products to one or more third parties  renegotiating third party agreements  selling assets  securing additional debt financing and or selling additional equity securities 
our ability to successfully enter into any such arrangements is uncertain  and if funds are not available  or not available on terms acceptable to us  we may be required to revise our planned clinical trials  other development activities  capital expenditures  and or the scale of our operations 
as noted above  we expect to attempt to raise additional funds in advance of depleting our funds  however  we may not be able to raise funds or raise amounts sufficient to meet the long term needs of the business 
satisfying long term liquidity needs may require the successful commercialization of oncophage and or one or more partnering arrangements for our other prophage series vaccines  successful commercialization of vaccines containing qs under development by our licensees  and potentially successful commercialization of other product candidates  each of which will require additional capital  as discussed above 
we hope to earn royalties from our qs product in the timeframe

our future cash requirements include  but are not limited to  supporting clinical trial and regulatory efforts and continuing our other research and development programs 
since inception  we have entered into various agreements with institutions and clinical research organizations to conduct and monitor our clinical studies 
under these agreements  subject to the enrollment of patients and performance by the applicable institution of certain services  we have estimated our payments to be million over the term of the studies 
through december   we have expensed million as research and development expenses and million has been paid related to these clinical studies 
the timing of expense recognition and future payments related to these agreements is subject to the enrollment of patients and performance by the applicable institution of certain services 
we have also entered into sponsored research agreements related to our product candidates that required payments of million  all of which has been paid as of december  we plan to enter into additional sponsored research agreements  and we anticipate significant additional expenditures will be required to advance 
table of contents our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  continue development of our technologies  and bring our product candidates to market 
part of our strategy is to develop and commercialize some of our product candidates by continuing our existing collaborative arrangements with academic and collaborative partners and licensees and by entering into new collaborations 
as a result of our collaborative agreements  we will not completely control the efforts to attempt to bring those product candidates to market 
we have various agreements  for example  with collaborative partners and or licensees  which allow the use of our qs adjuvant in numerous vaccines 
these agreements grant exclusive worldwide rights in some fields of use and co exclusive or non exclusive rights in others 
these agreements generally provide us with rights to manufacture and supply qs to the collaborative partner or licensee and also call for royalties to be paid to us on future sales of licensed vaccines that include qs  which may or may not be achieved 
significant investment in manufacturing capacity could be required if we were to retain our manufacturing and supply rights 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
we continue to support and develop our qs partnering collaborations  with the goal of earning royalties from this product in the timeframe 
our future ability to generate cash from operations will depend on achieving regulatory approval of our product candidates  and market acceptance of oncophage and our product candidates  achieving benchmarks as defined in existing collaborative agreements  and our ability to enter into new collaborations

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base those estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is dictated by us generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for our judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies 
share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation  we recognize share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those share based awards expected to vest 
compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
stock options granted to certain non employees have been accounted for based on the fair value method of accounting in accordance with asc  equity equity based payments to non employees 
as a result  the noncash charge to operations for non employee options with vesting or other performance criteria is affected each reporting period  until the non employee options vest  by changes in the fair value of our common stock 
under the provisions of asc  the change in fair value of vested options issued to non employees is reflected in the statement of operations each reporting period  until the options are exercised or expire 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires the use of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 
fair value accounting derivative liability as a result of the adoption of certain guidance within asc  derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own equity  as of january   the conversion feature embedded in our notes was treated as a derivative and recorded at its fair value  with period to period changes in the fair value recorded as a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
in february  we entered into a ninth amendment of rights agreement for the notes and as amended  the notes no longer fall within this guidance since they are no longer convertible into our common stock  therefore the conversion option is no longer a derivative liability 

table of contents we measured fair value based on a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the company s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
our derivative liability was valued based on significant unobservable inputs 
revenue recognition revenue for services under research and development contracts are recognized as the services are performed  or as clinical trial materials are provided 
non refundable milestone payments that represent the completion of a separate earnings process are recognized as revenue when earned 
license fees and royalties are recognized as they are earned 
revenue recognized from collaborative agreements is based upon the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  as amended by accounting standards update recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued additional guidance on when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the criteria for evaluating step of the goodwill impairment test and proceeding to step was amended for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires performing step if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  upon adoption of this guidance on january   we had a negative carrying value but determined there were no qualitative factors that indicated it was more likely than not that a goodwill impairment existed and accordingly  step of the goodwill impairment test was not required to be performed 
the adoption of this amended guidance did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb amended the guidance on the annual testing of goodwill for impairment 
this amended guidance permits companies to assess qualitative factors to determine whether to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
this amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
we do not anticipate any material impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued accounting standard update no 
 comprehensive income asu which increases the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements 
under this standard  the components of net income and other comprehensive income must be presented in either one or two consecutive financial statements 
the standard eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim and annual periods thereafter 
the standard should be applied retrospectively and early adoption is permitted 
adoption of this standard will impact only the presentation of our financial information 
in december  the fasb decided to defer the effective date of those changes in asu that relate only to the presentation of reclassification adjustments in the statement of income by issuing asu  comprehensive income 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 
the amendments in asu require companies to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of their financial statements to understand the effects of those arrangements on its financial position 
asu is required to be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented and is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after january  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates as we seek debt financing and invest excess cash 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk related to our transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not currently employ specific strategies  such as the use of derivative instruments or hedging  to manage these exposures 
our currency exposures vary  but are primarily concentrated in the euro 
during the year ended december   there has been no material change with respect to our interest rate and foreign currency exposures or our approach toward those exposures 
however  we are exploring possible commercialization of oncophage outside of the us  which could result in increased foreign currency exposure 
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations as of december  fair value included herein has been estimated taking into consideration the nature and terms of each instrument and the prevailing economic and market conditions at december  the table presents principal payments by year of maturity based on the terms of the debt in thousands 
estimated fair value outstanding principal amount december  year of maturity long term debt fixed interest rates range from to 
the above table is based on the assumptions that future interest on the notes is paid in cash and that these notes are not converted at maturity august  in certain circumstances  the notes could be converted before then 
in addition  the table is based on the assumption that the notes are redeemed on february  in certain circumstances  the notes could be converted on or before february  the note holders of our notes can require us to redeem debt at certain dates between and if the notes are not converted and we are not required to purchase the notes  they mature on february  the estimated fair value of our long term debt was derived by evaluating the nature and terms of each note and considering the prevailing economic and market conditions at the balance sheet date 
in addition  the fair value of our notes was estimated based on the most recent market transactions 
we had cash and cash equivalents at december  of million  which are exposed to the impact of interest and foreign currency exchange rate changes  and our interest income fluctuates as interest rates change 
due to the short term nature of our investments in money market funds  our carrying value approximates the fair value of these investments at december   however  we are subject to investment risk 
we invest our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs  and maximize yields 
we review our investment policy annually and amend it as deemed necessary 
currently  the investment policy prohibits investing in any structured investment vehicles and asset backed commercial paper 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer  or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not invest in derivative financial instruments 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is currently any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
