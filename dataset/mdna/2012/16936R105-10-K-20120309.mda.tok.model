inflation and currency matters china s economy has experienced rapid growth recently  mostly through the issuance of debt 
debt induced economic growth can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation 
if prices for the company s products rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for the rise in the cost of supplies  it may harm the company s profitability 
in order to control inflation in the past  the chinese government has imposed controls on bank credit  limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending 
such policies can lead to a slowing of economic growth 
rises in interest rates by the central bank would likely slow economic activity in china which could  in turn  materially increase the company s costs and also reduce demand for the company s products 
foreign operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad  including price and currency exchange controls  and fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
during  the company supplied products to north america and settled in cash in us dollars 
as a result  appreciation or currency fluctuation of the rmb against the us dollar would increase the cost of export products  and adversely affect the company s financial performance 
in july  the chinese government adjusted its exchange rate policy from fixed rate to floating rate 
during july to december  the exchange rate between rmb and us dollar appreciated from rmb to us to rmb to us 
this significant appreciation of the rmb may continue for in the near term  as the chinese government attempts to slow the rate of inflation in the prc 
significant appreciation of the rmb is likely to decrease the income of export products  thus decreasing the company s cash flow

significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires the company to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time it was making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that the company could have selected would have had a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations

expected volatility risk free rate interest market risk credit risk redemption activities before maturity uncertain tax uncertain tax positions the company is required to determine and assess all material positions  including all significant uncertain positions in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge under relevant tax statutes 
the company applies a more likely than not threshold and a two step approach for tax position measurement and financial statement recognition 
for the two step approach  the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon settlement 
an allocation or a shift of income between jurisdictions the characterization of income or a decision to exclude reporting taxable income in a tax return a decision to classify a transaction  entity  or other position in a tax return as tax exempt in addition  there are other items within the company s financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above

although not significant in recent years  changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  the company uses sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have 
foreign currency risk the company s reporting currency is the us dollar and the majority of its revenues will be settled in rmb and us dollars 
the company s currency exchange rate risks come primarily from the sales of products to international customers 
most of the company s assets are denominated in rmb except for part of cash and accounts receivable 
as a result  the company is exposed to foreign exchange risk as its revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the rmb 
the value of the rmb fluctuates and is affected by  among other things  changes in china s political and economic conditions 
in addition  the rmb is not readily convertible into us dollars or other foreign currencies 
all foreign exchange transactions continue to take place either through the bank of china or other banks authorized to buy and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rate quoted by the people s bank of china 
the conversion of rmb into foreign currencies such as the us dollar has been generally based on rates set by the people s bank of china  which are set daily based on the previous day s interbank foreign exchange market rates and current exchange rates on the world financial markets 
on december  and  the exchange rates of rmb against us dollar were rmb to us and rmb to us  respectively 
this floating exchange rate  and any appreciation of the rmb that may result from such rate  could have various adverse effects on the company s business 
if the rmb appreciates against foreign currencies  it will make the company s sales income increase 
in order to mitigate the currency exchange rate risk  the company has inserted a currency exchange rate fluctuation compensation provision in its sales contracts with its international customers to the effect that both parties will bear of such loss when the fluctuation is over within that contract year 
credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable 
the company does not require collateral or other security to support client receivables since most of its customers are large  well established companies 
the company s credit risk is also mitigated because its customers are all selected enterprises supported by the local government 
one customer  chery automobile co 
ltd  accounted for more than of the company s consolidated revenues in the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for any potential credit losses related to its trade receivables 
the company does not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies and the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
