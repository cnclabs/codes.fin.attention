we are a broadline retailer and  at the end of  had  kmart and domestic full line stores and  specialty retail stores in the united states operating through kmart and sears and full line and specialty retail stores in canada operating through sears canada  a owned subsidiary 
we plan to close stores and change the format of stores in the first half of we currently conduct our operations in three reportable business segments kmart  sears domestic and sears canada 
the nature of operations conducted within each of these segments is discussed within the business segments section of item in this report on form k 
our business segments have been determined in accordance with accounting standards regarding the determination  and reporting  of business segments 
the retail industry is highly competitive and as such  holdings faces significant challenges  including the current macroeconomic environment  as many of our product categories are impacted by the housing market and availability of credit to our customers 
the retail industry is also rapidly evolving as retail is increasingly impacted by new technologies and social media 
we believe that this evolution provides us with significant growth opportunities  if we are able to transform our portfolio of businesses by leveraging our existing store network with emerging technologies and our shop your way rewards program to develop lasting relationships with our customers 
we consider ourselves to be an asset rich enterprise with multiple resources at our disposal 
at year end  we had billion in liquidity and significant value in our asset portfolio  including valuable iconic proprietary brands  a valuable real estate portfolio  well known stand alone businesses and a flexible financial structure 
we are taking actions to address our operating performance in three areas first  we are implementing immediate actions which we believe will improve our financial performance  including cost and inventory reductions  closure of marginally performing stores  actions to improve margins  and bringing in talent to strengthen the leadership team 
we have reduced inventory by million below last year s level and our promotional cadence has been adjusted to be more targeted 
second  we are executing actions intended to unlock the value of our portfolio  such as our recently announced real estate transactions that are expected to generate approximately million million for sears domestic and million canadian for sears canada in cash proceeds upon their closing  which are expected to occur in our first quarter  as well as our announcement of plans to separate the hometown and outlet businesses and certain hardware stores through a transfer to electing shareholders to purchase an interest in these businesses 
the hometown and outlet businesses and certain hardware stores combined assets represent approximately billion to billion in shc revenue and between million and million in shc ebitda with million to million in shc net assets and million to million in shc net inventory net of merchandise payables 
third  we are accelerating actions intended to drive our strategic agenda to become the leader in integrated retail 
profound changes in technology are changing the entire retail landscape  the ways customers shop and the way they live 
americans spend as much time today on the internet as they do watching tv  and more time today on their mobile devices than they do with print media 
customers are more connected and empowered than ever before 
we are accelerating our actions to bring together a unique set of technology and retail assets to deliver a seamless  integrated experience for our shop your way rewards members and customers at the store  online  and in the home 
at the core of our strategy we are building a deeply engaging membership program  called shop your way rewards 
we re building technologies and a platform that we expect will allow us to have continuous relationships with our customers 
we launched our shop your way rewards program late in and continued to grow membership and capabilities in the shop your way rewards program is intended to transition sears holdings from serving customers to building relationships with members 
we believe that shop your way rewards will allow us to learn more about our individual customers and therefore position us to better meet their needs 
the shop your way rewards program will also enhance our ability to communicate with customers digitally 
such digital communication tools present a new opportunity to personalize our messages and make them more individually relevant 
what the future holds for sears holdings is a progressive re shaping and deepening of our relationships with our members 
given the size of our membership today and the breadth of our assortment  this is very compelling for our business model 
in  we invested several hundred million dollars in our customer experience across touch points 
we believe that our investments will deliver compelling benefits to our members  several of which are already in the market  like return and exchanges of online purchases in minutes or less  no receipt required  great deals personalized to consumers interests  and assistance by associates with innovative technology applications and devices to help find the right appliance or tv or tractor to fit our customers needs 
we will continue to invest in our online properties 
by integrating our vast store network with our online properties  we believe that sears holdings will succeed in the rapidly evolving retail environment 
the web and mobile platforms integrate shopping and marketing in a very different way than stores and traditional media have in the past 
results of operations fiscal year our fiscal year end is the saturday closest to january each year 
fiscal years  and all consisted of weeks 
unless otherwise stated  references to years in this report relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years 
the following fiscal periods are presented in this report 
fiscal year ended weeks january  january  january  holdings consolidated results holdings consolidated results of operations for  and are summarized as follows millions  except per share data revenues merchandise sales and services costs and expenses cost of sales  buying and occupancy gross margin dollars margin rate selling and administrative selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues depreciation and amortization impairment charges gain on sales of assets total costs and expenses operating income loss interest expense interest and investment income other loss income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests net income loss attributable to holdings shareholders amounts attributable to holdings shareholders income loss from continuing operations  net of tax income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss net income loss per common share attributable to holdings shareholders diluted continuing operations discontinued operations diluted weighted average common shares outstanding references to comparable store sales amounts within the following discussion include sales for all stores operating for a period of at least full months  including remodeled and expanded stores  but excluding store relocations and stores that have undergone format changes 
comparable store sales results for were calculated based on the week period ended january  beginning with the first quarter of  we now include in comparable store sales online sales from sears 
com and kmart 
com shipped directly to customers 
these online sales increased for compared to the change resulted in a positive benefit of approximately basis points to total domestic comparable sales for  predominately in the sears domestic segment 
compared to net income loss from continuing operations attributable to holdings shareholders we recorded a net loss from continuing operations attributable to holdings shareholders of billion loss per diluted share from continuing operations for  as compared to net income from continuing operations of million per diluted share from continuing operations in our results for and were affected by a number of significant items  including a billion non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets in our net loss from continuing operations as adjusted for these significant items was million loss per diluted share from continuing operations for and our net income from continuing operations adjusted for these similar significant items was million per diluted share from continuing operations for the decrease in net income for the year reflected a decrease in operating income of billion  including the impact of non cash impairment charges and charges related to store closures 
excluding these items  operating income declined billion  primarily related to a decline in our gross margin dollars  given lower sales  and a decline in gross margin rate of basis points  and an increase in selling and administrative expenses 
in addition to our net loss from continuing operations determined in accordance with gaap  for purposes of evaluating operating performance  we use an adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda measurement as well as adjusted earnings per share adjusted eps 
adjusted ebitda is computed as net income loss attributable to sears holdings corporation appearing on the statements of operations excluding income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest  income tax expense  interest and investment income  other loss  interest expense  gain on sales of assets and depreciation and amortization 
in addition  it is adjusted to exclude certain significant items as set forth below 
our management uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses  as well as executive compensation metrics  for comparable periods 
adjusted ebitda should not be used by investors or other third parties as the sole basis for formulating investment decisions as it excludes a number of important cash and non cash recurring items 
while adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measurement  management believes that it is an important indicator of operating performance because ebitda excludes the effects of financings and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest and depreciation costs  management considers gains losses on the sale of assets to result from investing decisions rather than ongoing operations  and other significant items  while periodically affecting our results  may vary significantly from period to period and have a disproportionate effect in a given period  which affects comparability of results 
adjusted ebitda was determined as follows millions net income loss attributable to shc per statement of operations income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax income tax expense interest expense interest and investment income other loss operating income loss depreciation and amortization gain on sales of assets before excluded items impairment charges closed store reserve and severance domestic pension expense hurricane losses visa mastercard settlement adjusted ebitda as defined to revenues adjusted ebitda for our segments are as follows adjusted ebitda to revenues millions kmart sears domestic sears canada total adjusted ebitda we also believe that use of adjusted eps improves the comparability of year to year results and is representative of our underlying performance 
we have chosen to provide this supplemental information to illustrate the results of operations giving effect to the non gaap adjustments shown in the reconciliations below  and to provide an additional measure of performance 
the following tables set forth results of operations on a gaap and as adjusted basis  as well as the impact each significant item used in calculating adjusted ebitda had on specific income and expense amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations during the years  and weeks ended january  millions  except per share data gaap domestic pension expense closed store reserve and severance mark to market losses gain on sales of assets hurricane losses goodwill impairment tax matters discontinued operations as adjusted cost of sales  buying and occupancy impact selling and administrative impact depreciation and amortization impact impairment charges impact gain on sales of assets impact operating income loss impact other loss impact income tax expense impact income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  impact income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest impact after tax and noncontrolling interest impact diluted loss per share impact weeks ended january  millions  except per share data gaap domestic pension expense closed store reserve and severance mark to market losses gain on sales of real estate canadian dividend tax impact tax matters discontinued operations as adjusted cost of sales  buying and occupancy impact selling and administrative impact depreciation and amortization impact gain on sales of assets impact operating income impact other loss impact income tax expense impact income from discontinued operations  net of tax  impact income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest impact after tax and noncontrolling interest impact diluted income per share impact weeks ended january  millions  except per share data gaap domestic pension expense closed store reserve and severance mark to market losses gain on sale of sears canada headquarters visa mastercard settlement tax matters discontinued operations as adjusted cost of sales  buying and occupancy impact selling and administrative impact depreciation and amortization impact gain on sales of assets impact operating income impact other loss impact income tax expense impact income from discontinued operations  net of tax  impact income attributable to noncontrolling interest impact after tax and noncontrolling interest impact diluted income per share impact during  we recorded a billion non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets 
accounting rules generally require that a valuation reserve be established when income has not been generated over a three year cumulative period to support the deferred tax asset 
while an accounting loss was recorded  we believe no economic loss has occurred as these net operating losses and tax benefits remain available to reduce future taxes as income is generated in subsequent periods 
contributions to our pension plans remain a significant use of our cash on an annual basis 
while sears holdings pension plan is frozen  and thus associates do not currently earn pension benefits  we have a legacy pension obligation for past service performed by kmart and sears  roebuck and co 
associates

we anticipate capital expenditure levels to be slightly below levels with continued investment in information technology upgrades and the infrastructure of our facilities 
it should be noted that in the normal course of business  we consider opportunities to purchase leased operating properties  as well as offers to sell owned  or assign leased  operating and non operating properties 
these transactions may  individually or in the aggregate  result in material proceeds or outlays of cash and cause our capital expenditure levels to vary from period to period 
in addition  we review leases that will expire in the short term in order to determine the appropriate action to take with respect to them 
during  we purchased previously leased operating properties for million

uses and sources of liquidity our primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of our businesses  capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes  including debt repayment  pension plan contributions and common share repurchases 
we consider ourselves to be an asset rich enterprise with substantial liquidity and financial flexibility benefiting from multiple funding resources such as our billion domestic revolving credit facility through april  an million credit canadian revolver through september  billion of senior secured notes due in further  there is approximately million of remaining sears  roebuck and co 
debt from the merger 
these funding resources are described in more detail below 
as of january   we had billion of liquidity with cash balances of million and nearly billion of capacity on the domestic and canadian revolving credit facilities 
the revolver and senior secured notes are firmly in place for the next several years and are supported by an asset base which includes billion of inventory  owned and leased real estate assets  market leading proprietary brands such as kenmore  craftsman and diehard  and successful stand alone businesses such as lands end and sears canada 
this asset base provides us flexibility as we seek to transform our business 
we recently announced our plans to separate sears hometown and outlet businesses and certain hardware stores in the third quarter of through a transfer to electing shareholders  which is expected to generate in the range of million to million in proceeds 
we also announced that we are in the process of completing a real estate transaction for stores for million  which is expected to close in april in addition  sears canada announced that it has entered into an agreement to surrender and early terminate the leases on three properties for million canadian in cash proceeds  which is also expected to close in april in  we also sharpened our focus to manage our merchandise inventory and payables more closely to improve our productivity and increase our return on invested capital 
we have already made some progress in reducing our inventory investment as inventory decreased million from the prior year while merchandise payables have decreased by million 
inventory productivity will continue to be a main focus in and we currently plan to realize further reductions in our peak inventory in in excess of the million to million previously communicated on december  these inventory management initiatives coupled with the transactions unlocking the value in our assets that were mentioned above are expected to generate over billion in capital in we have ongoing discussions concerning our liquidity and financial position with the vendor community and third parties that offer various credit protection services to our vendors 
the topics discussed have included such areas as pricing  payment terms and ongoing business arrangements

our year end and outstanding borrowings excluding borrowings related to orchard were as follows millions january  january  short term borrowings unsecured commercial paper secured borrowings long term debt  including current portion notes and debentures outstanding capitalized lease obligations total borrowings domestic credit agreement during the first quarter of  we increased the borrowing capacity and extended the maturity date of our domestic credit agreement the original domestic credit agreement by entering into an amended credit agreement the amended domestic credit agreement 
the amended domestic credit agreement increased the borrowing capacity of the facility to billion from billion and extended its expiration date to april from june we view this credit facility as our most cost efficient funding mechanism and therefore use it as a primary source of funding 
the amended domestic credit agreement also revised certain terms of the credit facility 
advances continue to bear interest at a rate equal to  at the election of the borrowers  either the london interbank offered rate libor or a base rate  in either case plus an applicable margin 
the amended facility s interest rates for libor based borrowings vary based on leverage in the range of libor plus to  compared to libor plus with a libor floor under the original domestic credit agreement

the amended domestic credit agreement permits aggregate second lien indebtedness of up to billion  of which billion second lien notes were outstanding at january   providing the company the capacity to issue up to an additional million in second lien indebtedness 
the amended domestic credit agreement is in place as a funding source for general corporate purposes and is an asset based revolving credit facility under which sears roebuck acceptance corp

the amended domestic credit agreement is secured by a first lien on most of our domestic inventory and credit card and pharmacy receivables  and is subject to a borrowing base formula to determine availability 
the amended domestic credit agreement limits our ability to make restricted payments  including dividends and share repurchases  if availability under the credit facility  as defined  is less than 
it also imposes various other requirements  which take effect if availability falls below designated thresholds  including a cash dominion requirement and a requirement that the fixed charge ratio at the last day of any quarter be not less than to based on availability  none of these requirements were in effect at january  at january   we had million of borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under the amended domestic credit agreement 
as a result  our availability under the agreement was billion at january  the majority of the letters of credit outstanding are used to provide collateral for our insurance programs

the lien that secures the notes is junior in priority to the lien on such assets that secures obligations under the amended domestic credit agreement  as well as certain other first priority lien obligations 
the company used the net proceeds of this offering to repay borrowings outstanding under the original domestic credit agreement on the settlement date and to fund the working capital requirements of our retail businesses  capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes 
the indenture under which the notes were issued contains restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit the ability of the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and limit the ability of the company to consolidate with or merge into  or sell other than for cash or lease all or substantially all of its assets to  another person 
the indenture also provides for certain events of default  which  if any were to occur  would permit or require the principal and accrued and unpaid interest on all the then outstanding notes to be due and payable immediately 
generally  the company is required to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount if the borrowing base as calculated pursuant to the indenture falls below the principal value of the notes plus any other indebtedness for borrowed money that is secured by liens on the collateral for two consecutive quarters or upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events 
the company may call the notes at a premium based on the treasury rate as defined in the indenture  plus basis points

application of critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the financial statements  certain accounting policies require considerable judgment to select the appropriate assumptions to calculate financial estimates 
these estimates are complex and subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  evaluation of trends and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change 
although the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the financial statements  we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or different estimates that could have been selected would have a material effect on our financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and the considerations used in estimating amounts  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the selection of these estimates 
the following is a summary of our most critical policies and estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a listing of our other significant accounting policies 
valuation of inventory our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined primarily using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that is commonly used in the retail industry 
to determine inventory cost under rim  inventory at its retail selling value is segregated into groupings of merchandise having similar characteristics  which are then converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each grouping of merchandise 
cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise group based upon the year purchasing activity for each store location 
accordingly  a significant assumption under the retail method is that inventory in each group is similar in terms of its cost to retail relationship and has similar turnover rates 
management monitors the content of merchandise in these groupings to prevent distortions that would have a material effect on inventory valuation 
rim inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly affect the ending inventory valuation  as well as gross margin 
among others  two significant estimates used in inventory valuation are the level and timing of permanent markdowns clearance markdowns used to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory and shrinkage 
amounts are charged to cost of sales  buying and occupancy at the time the retail value of inventory is reduced through the use of permanent markdowns 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise  fashion trends and weather conditions 
in addition  inventory is also evaluated against corporate pre determined historical markdown cadences 
when a decision is made to permanently markdown merchandise  the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
the timing of the decision  particularly surrounding the balance sheet date  can have a significant effect on the results of operations 
shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the date of the last physical inventory to the end of the year 
physical inventories are taken annually for all stores and inventory records are adjusted accordingly 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience  is used as the basis for the shrinkage accrual following the physical inventory 
self insurance reserves we use a combination of third party insurance and or self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  asbestos and environmental  automobile  warranty  product and general liability claims 
general liability costs relate primarily to litigation that arises from store operations 
self insurance reserves include actuarial estimates of both claims filed and carried at their expected ultimate settlement value and claims incurred but not yet reported 
our estimated claim amounts are discounted using a rate with a duration that approximates the duration of our self insurance reserve portfolio 
our liability reflected on the consolidated balance sheets represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred at the balance sheet date 
in estimating this liability  we utilize loss development factors based on company specific data to project the future development of incurred losses 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
these projections are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
although we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from the historical trends and the actuarial assumptions 
defined benefit retirement plans the fundamental components of accounting for defined benefit retirement plans consist of the compensation cost of the benefits earned  the interest cost from deferring payment of those benefits into the future and the results of investing any assets set aside to fund the obligation 
such retirement benefits were earned by associates ratably over their service careers 
therefore  the amounts reported in the income statement for these retirement plans have historically followed the same pattern 
accordingly  changes in the obligations or the value of assets to fund them have been recognized systematically and gradually over the associate s estimated period of service 
the largest drivers of losses or charges in recent years have been the discount rate used to determine the present value of the obligation and the actual return on pension assets 
we recognize the changes by amortizing experience gains losses in excess of the corridor into expense over the associate service period and by recognizing the difference between actual and expected asset returns over a five year period 
holdings actuarial valuations utilize key assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  changes in investment strategies  higher or lower withdrawal rates  and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
the investment committee  made up of select members of senior management  has appointed a non affiliated third party professional to advise the committee with respect to the shc domestic pension plan assets 
the plan s overall investment objective is to provide a long term return that  along with company contributions  is expected to meet future benefit payment requirements 
a long term horizon has been adopted in establishing investment policy such that the likelihood and duration of investment losses are carefully weighed against the long term potential for appreciation of assets 
the plan s investment policy requires investments to be diversified across individual securities  industries  market capitalization and valuation characteristics 
in addition  various techniques are utilized to monitor  measure and manage risk 
for purposes of determining the periodic expense of our defined benefit plans  we use the fair value of plan assets as the market related value 
a one percentage point change in the assumed discount rate would have the following effects on the pension liability millions percentage point increase percentage point decrease effect on interest cost component effect on pension benefit obligation for and beyond  the domestic weighted average health care cost trend rates used in measuring the postretirement benefit expense are a trend rate in to an ultimate trend rate of in a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects on the postretirement liability millions percentage point increase percentage point decrease effect on total service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation income taxes we account for income taxes according to accounting standards for such taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if future utilization of deferred tax assets is uncertain  the company may record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and results of recent operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider cumulative operating income loss over the past several years 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income 
after consideration of evidence regarding the ability to realize our deferred tax assets  we recorded a charge of billion to establish a valuation allowance against certain deferred income tax assets in in accordance with accounting standards for uncertain tax positions  we record unrecognized tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns  including the decision to exclude certain income or transactions from a return  when a more likely than not threshold is met for a tax position and management believes that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
further  we record the largest amount of the unrecognized tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position  assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and  if so  the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  if any 
as further described above  management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
our actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items  including changes in income tax laws  tax planning and the company s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
although management believes current estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
domestic and foreign tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record reserves in accordance with accounting standards for uncertain tax positions 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
management s estimates at the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment  giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change

in march we allocated goodwill  which is defined as the total purchase price less the fair value of all assets and liabilities acquired  to reporting units at the acquisition date 
as required by accounting standards  we perform annual goodwill and intangible impairment tests in the fourth quarter and update the tests between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment assessments our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value using the best information available  using both a market participant approach  as well as a discounted cash flow model  commonly referred to as the income approach 
the market participant approach determines the value of a reporting unit by deriving market multiples for reporting units based on assumptions potential market participants would use in establishing a bid price for the unit 
this approach therefore assumes strategic initiatives will result in improvements in operational performance in the event of purchase  and includes the application of a discount rate based on market participant assumptions with respect to capital structure and access to capital markets 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions appropriate to each of our reporting units 
the projection uses management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including growth rates in sales  costs  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
our final estimate of fair value of reporting units is developed by equally weighting the fair values determined through both the market participant and income approaches  where comparable market participant information is available 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we record an impairment charge for the difference 
after performing the first step of the process in  we determined goodwill recorded at two of the reporting units within the sears domestic segment were potentially impaired 
after performing the second step of the process  we determined that the total amount of goodwill recorded at these reporting units was impaired and recorded a charge of million 
the impairment charge was primarily driven by the combination of lower sales and continued margin pressure coupled with expense increases which led to a decline in our operating profit 
we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in or the use of different assumptions  estimates or judgments in either step of the goodwill impairment testing process  such as the estimated future cash flows of our reporting units  the discount rate used to discount such cash flows  or the estimated fair value of the reporting units tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  could significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or its net assets  and therefore  impact the related impairment charge 
at the annual impairment test date  the conclusion that no indication of goodwill impairment existed for the remaining reporting units would not have changed had the test been conducted assuming a basis point increase in the discount rate used to discount the aggregate estimated cash flows of our reporting units to their net present value in determining their estimated fair values and or a basis point decrease in the estimated sales growth rate and or terminal period growth rate 
based on our sensitivity analysis  we do not believe that the remaining recorded goodwill balance is at risk of impairment at any reporting unit at the end of the year because the fair value is substantially in excess of the carrying value and not at risk of failing step one 
however  goodwill impairment charges may be recognized in future periods in one or more of the reporting units to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur  including deterioration in the macroeconomic environment  retail industry or in the equity markets  which includes the market value of our common shares  deterioration in our performance or our future projections  or changes in our plans for one or more reporting units 
intangible asset impairment assessments we review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we consider both the market approach and income approach when testing intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis 
we determined that the income approach  specifically the relief from royalty method  was most appropriate for analyzing our indefinite lived assets 
this method is based on the assumption that  in lieu of ownership  a firm would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this asset class 
the relief from royalty method involves two steps i estimation of reasonable royalty rates for the assets and ii the application of these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine a value 
we multiplied the selected royalty rate by the forecasted net sales stream to calculate the cost savings relief from royalty payment associated with the assets 
the cash flows are then discounted to present value by the selected discount rate and compared to the carrying value of the assets 
we did not record any intangible asset impairment charges in  or the use of different assumptions  estimates or judgments in our intangible asset impairment testing process  such as the estimated future cash flows of assets and the discount rate used to discount such cash flows  could significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of an asset  and therefore  impact the related impairment charge 
at the annual impairment test date  the above noted conclusion that no indication of intangible asset impairment existed at the test date would not have changed had the test been conducted assuming a basis point increase in the discount rate used to discount the aggregate estimated cash flows of our assets to their net present value in determining their estimated fair values without any change in the aggregate estimated cash flows of our intangibles  a basis point decrease in the terminal period growth rate without a change in the discount rate of each intangible  or a basis point decrease in the royalty rate applied to the forecasted net sales stream of our assets 
based on our sensitivity analysis  we do not believe that the indefinite lived intangible balance is at risk of impairment at the end of the year because the fair values are substantially in excess of the carrying values 
however  indefinite lived intangible impairment charges may be recognized in future periods to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur  including deterioration in the macroeconomic environment  retail industry  deterioration in our performance or our future projections  or changes in our plans for one or more indefinite lived intangible asset

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face market risk exposure in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
these market risks arise from our derivative financial instruments and debt obligations 
interest rate risk we manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed and variable rate funding 
all debt securities are considered non trading 
at january   of our debt portfolio was variable rate 
based on the size of this variable rate debt portfolio at january   which totaled approximately billion  an immediate basis point change in interest rates would have affected annual pretax funding costs by million 
these estimates do not take into account the effect on income resulting from invested cash or the returns on assets being funded 
these estimates also assume that the variable rate funding portfolio remains constant for an annual period and that the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period 
foreign currency risk at january   we had a foreign currency forward contract outstanding  totaling million canadian notional value and with a weighted average remaining life of years  designed to hedge our net investment in sears canada against adverse changes in exchange rates 
the fair value of the forward contract at january  was million 
a hypothetical adverse movement in the level of the canadian exchange rate relative to the us dollar at january   with all other variables held constant  would have resulted in a fair value of our foreign currency forward contract of approximately million at january   a decrease of million 
our foreign currency forward contract requires collateral be posted in the event our liability under such contract reaches a predetermined threshold 
cash collateral posted under this contract is recorded as part of our accounts receivable balance 
we had million cash collateral posted under this contract at january  counterparties we actively manage the risk of nonpayment by our derivative counterparties by limiting our exposure to individual counterparties based on credit ratings  value at risk and maturities 
the counterparties to these instruments are major financial institutions with credit ratings of single a or better 
in certain cases  counterparty risk is also managed through the use of collateral in the form of cash or us government securities
