overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new oncology therapeutics for the treatment of solid and hematologic cancers 
our efforts are currently focused primarily on the development of vosaroxin for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia  or aml 
in december  we commenced enrollment of a phase  multi national  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  pivotal trial of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory aml  or the valor trial 
the valor trial is designed to evaluate the effect of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine  a widely used chemotherapy in aml  on overall survival as compared to placebo in combination with cytarabine 
we expect to enroll evaluable patients in the valor trial at more than study sites in the us  canada  europe  australia and new zealand 
the trial is designed to have a probability of detecting a difference in overall survival  and includes a single pre specified interim analysis by the independent data and safety monitoring board  or dsmb  which is expected to occur in the third quarter of the dsmb will examine pre specified efficacy and safety data sets and decide whether to i stop the trial early for efficacy or for futility  ii continue the study to its planned unblinding  which is expected in mid in this event  or iii recommend a one time sample size adjustment of additional evaluable patients if deemed beneficial to maintain adequate statistical power across a range of clinically meaningful and statistically significant outcomes 
in this event  trial unblinding is expected in early in december  we announced that the dsmb had completed a planned periodic safety review and recommended that the trial continue as planned without changes to study conduct 
we are also completing data analysis in preparation for database lock for two fully enrolled clinical trials of vosaroxin a the phase portion of a phase b trial of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine for the 
table of contents treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory aml  and b a phase trial in previously untreated patients age years or older with aml  or reveal  which explored three dose schedules 
in addition  we completed a phase single agent trial of vosaroxin in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer in  which explored three doses and two different schedules of vosaroxin 
in december  we announced our participation in the li trial  a phase randomized  controlled  multi center trial evaluating novel treatment regimens against low dose cytarabine  or ld ara c  in patients older than years with aml or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome  or mds 
several treatments  including two regimens containing vosaroxin  will be evaluated in a randomized phase design with key endpoints including complete remission  month survival  and overall survival 
treatment arms exhibiting promising results on the basis of these endpoints may continue to enroll in a phase portion of the trial with a primary endpoint of overall survival 
in march  the first patient was enrolled in this trial 
we own worldwide development and commercialization rights to vosaroxin 
in  the us food and drug administration  or fda  granted orphan drug designation to vosaroxin for the treatment of aml 
in february  the fda granted fast track designation to vosaroxin for the potential treatment of relapsed or refractory aml in combination with cytarabine 
in the last three years  we have been granted  or notified of allowance of  a number of key patents for vosaroxin  as follows in december  the european patent office  or epo  granted us a patent covering combinations of vosaroxin with cytarabine  which is due to expire in and has been validated in multiple epc member states 
in june  the us patent and trademark office  or uspto  granted us a patent in the same family  which is due to expire in in march  australia also granted us a patent in this family  which is due to expire corresponding applications are pending in other major markets  including japan and canada 
in november  the uspto granted us a patent covering pharmaceutical compositions of vosaroxin  including the formulation used in our valor trial 
this patent is due to expire in in january  the epo granted us a patent in the same family  which has been validated in multiple european patent convention  or epc  member states 
in september  australia also granted us a patent in this family 
these patents are due to expire in corresponding applications are pending in other major markets  including japan and canada 
in august  the uspto granted us a patent covering methods of use of vosaroxin at clinically relevant dose ranges and schedules for the treatment of leukemia 
this patent is due to expire in corresponding applications are pending in other major markets  including europe  japan  australia and canada 
in february  the uspto granted us a patent covering certain vosaroxin hydrate forms  which is due to expire in corresponding applications are pending in other major markets  including europe  japan  australia and canada 
in february  the uspto mailed a notice of allowance for a patent application covering certain compositions related to vosaroxin 
we expect that this patent will be granted in  and that it will be due to expire in corresponding patent applications are pending in the us and internationally 
in march  we entered into three agreements as part of a series of agreements between biogen idec ma inc  or biogen idec  millennium pharmaceuticals  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of takeda pharmaceutical company limited  or millennium  and ourselves a license agreement with millennium  or the millennium agreement  pursuant to which we granted millennium exclusive licenses for the development of our oral  selective pan raf kinase inhibitor 
table of contents and one additional undisclosed kinase inhibitor program in oncology that were previously a part of the original biogen idec agreement 
under this agreement  we may in the future receive up to million in pre commercialization milestone payments related to the development of the first two indications for each of the licensed products directed against the two exclusively licensed targets  and royalty payments depending on future product sales 
the agreement also provides us with future co development and co promotion rights 
in september  we announced that millennium had initiated a phase clinical study of an oral investigative drug selective for pan raf kinase inhibition  mln  which was licensed to them under this agreement 
an amendment and restatement of the original biogen idec agreement  or the restated biogen idec agreement  to provide for the discovery  development and commercialization of small molecule inhibitors of a unique preclinical kinase inhibitor program involved in immunology 
under this agreement  we continue to be eligible to receive up to million in pre commercialization milestone payments related to the development of the first two indications for licensed products against the specified immunology target  and royalty payments depending on future product sales 
we also retain future co development and co promotion rights 
a termination and transition agreement with biogen idec and millennium  which provides for the termination of biogen idec s exclusive rights under the original biogen idec agreement to all discovery programs under such agreement other than a preclinical kinase inhibitor program involved in immunology  the permitted assignment of assets and rights to millennium as provided in the millennium agreement  and the upfront  non refundable payment of million to us as consideration for the above  which was received in april in march  we licensed our lfa patents and related know how to sarcode bioscience  inc  or sarcode  a privately held biopharmaceutical company 
in march  the license agreement was terminated and sarcode paid us million in cash for this intellectual property 
in august  sarcode repaid three promissory notes that had been issued to us upon entering into the original license agreement 
the total amount received was million  which comprised the aggregate principal value of the three notes of million  plus million of accrued interest 
recent financial history on october   we entered into the loan agreement with a syndicate led by oxford finance llc and partnered with silicon valley bank and horizon technology finance corporation  under which we may borrow up to million in two tranches 
the first tranche of million was funded at closing 
the second tranche of million may be drawn at our option between june  and september   subject to our continued compliance with the loan agreement and contingent upon the recommendation by the dsmb following the interim analysis of the valor trial to either a discontinue the trial due to positive efficacy  or b continue the trial 
in connection with the drawdown of the first tranche of million  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to the lenders at an exercise price of per share 
the interest rate for the first tranche is per annum  and the interest rate for the second tranche will be fixed upon drawdown at a per annum rate equal to the greater of or plus the then effective three month us libor rate 
payments under the loan agreement are interest only through february   followed by equal monthly payments of principal and interest through the scheduled maturity date of october  in addition  a final payment equal to of the aggregate amount drawn will be due on october   or such earlier date specified in the loan agreement 
we have paid the lenders a facility fee of  in addition  if we repay all or a portion of the loan prior to maturity  we will pay the lenders a prepayment fee  based on a percentage of the then outstanding principal balance  equal to if the prepayment occurs on or prior to october   if the prepayment occurs on or prior to october   or if the prepayment occurs prior to october  
table of contents in april  we entered into a controlled equity offering sales agreement with cantor fitzgerald co  or cantor  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through cantor acting as agent and or principal 
in the year ended december   we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an average price of approximately per share for gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of million  after deducting cantor s commission 
as of december   million of common stock remained available to be sold  subject to certain conditions as specified in the agreement 
in august  we entered into an additional controlled equity offering sales agreement with cantor  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through cantor acting as agent and or principal 
as of december   no sales had been made under this facility  and million of common stock remained available to be sold  subject to certain conditions as specified in the agreement 
in february  we effected a one for six reverse split of our capital stock  or the reverse split 
as a result of the reverse split  every six shares of our capital stock were combined into one share of capital stock 
the reverse split affected the shares of our common stock a outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the reverse split  b available for issuance under our equity incentive plans  and c issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants 
all share and per share amounts in this annual report on form k have been adjusted to give effect to the reverse split 
we have incurred significant losses in each year since our inception 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development process and seek regulatory approvals for vosaroxin 
capital requirements while we believe that we currently have the resources to fund our operations until the planned unblinding of the valor trial in  we may need to raise additional capital if the costs of the trial exceed our current estimates or unblinding does not occur within the currently anticipated timeframe 
we will need to raise substantial additional capital to complete development and the potential commercialization of vosaroxin 
we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through equity issuances  debt arrangements  a possible license  collaboration or other similar arrangement with respect to development and or commercialization rights to vosaroxin  or a combination of the above 
however  we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise required funding on acceptable terms or at all  we will need to reduce operating expenses  enter into a collaboration or other similar arrangement with respect to development and or commercialization rights to vosaroxin  outlicense intellectual property rights to vosaroxin  sell assets  or a combination of the above  or be forced to delay or reduce the scope of our vosaroxin development program  potentially including the valor trial  and or limit or cease our operations 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes  including reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments on an 
table of contents ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for equity financings the accounting for the initial and second closing of the sale of million and million of units  respectively  under our private placement  and subsequent revaluations of the related financial instruments  required fair values to be established at different dates  either individually or in aggregate  for the four primary components of the private placement a the series a convertible preferred stock  b the warrants to purchase common stock  c the option for the investors to participate in the second closing  or the second closing option  and d the option for the investors to participate in the common equity closing  or the common equity closing option 
the option pricing method  which utilizes the black scholes model  was selected to determine these fair values  which were calculated as a series of call options on the potential enterprise value of the company at different valuation points at which the claims of the different stakeholder groups on the enterprise value would change 
the results of the black scholes model were affected by the company s stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly subjective variables 
these variables included the expected term of the financial instruments and our expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and dividend rate over the expected term 
alternative models could have been selected to calculate these fair values  which may have produced significantly different results 
in october  we completed an underwritten offering  or the offering  in which we sold our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
due to the potential for the warrants to be settled in cash upon the occurrence of certain transactions specified in the warrant agreements  the warrants are being accounted for as a derivative liability as opposed to permanent equity 
outstanding warrants under this arrangement are revalued to their fair value each period end  with the change in fair value recorded to other income expense in the statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 
the black scholes model was selected as the most appropriate method to estimate both the initial and subsequent fair values of the warrants 
the determination of initial and subsequent fair values is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables  as noted above 
changes in these input variables have  and will continue to  affect the income or expense recorded each period for the revaluation of outstanding warrants 
as a result  fluctuations in our stock price or other input variables may significantly affect our financial results 
revenue recognition revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification subtopic  multiple element arrangements  or asc under asc  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting based on whether certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer 
consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair value  and the applicable revenue recognition is applied to each of the separate units 
non refundable fees where we have no continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenues when collection is reasonably assured 
in situations where continuing performance obligations exist  non refundable fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the projected performance period 

table of contents milestone payments from license or collaboration agreements which are substantive and at risk at the time the agreement is executed are recognized upon completion of the applicable milestone event 
royalty revenues  if any  will be recognized based on reported product sales by third party licensees 
research funding from any future agreement will be recognized as the related research services are performed 
clinical trial accounting we record accruals for estimated clinical trial costs  which include payments for work performed by contract research organizations  or cros  and participating clinical trial sites 
these costs are generally a significant component of research and development expense 
costs incurred for setting up clinical trial sites for participation in trials are generally non refundable  and are expensed immediately  with any refundable advances related to enrollment of the first patient recorded as prepayments and assessed for recoverability on a quarterly basis 
costs related to patient enrollment are accrued as patients progress through the clinical trial  including amortization of any first patient prepayments 
this amortization generally matches when the related services are rendered  however  these cost estimates may or may not match the actual costs incurred by the cros or clinical trial sites  and if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  our clinical trial accruals may not be accurate 
the difference between accrued expenses based on our estimates and actual expenses have not been material to date 
overview of revenues we have not generated  and do not expect to generate in the near future  any revenue from sales of commercial products 
collaboration revenue over the past three years  our collaboration revenue was primarily from a million cash milestone payment that we received in july under the original biogen idec agreement as a result of biogen idec s selection of a raf kinase inhibitor development candidate for the treatment of cancer 
in march  we entered into the restated biogen idec agreement  which amended and restated the original biogen idec agreement 
under the restated biogen idec agreement  we continue to be eligible to receive up to million in pre commercialization milestone payments related to the development of the first two indications for licensed products against the specified immunology target  and royalty payments depending on future product sales 
we also retain future co development and co promotion rights 
license and other revenue in march  we entered into the millennium agreement  pursuant to which we granted millennium exclusive licenses for the development of our oral  selective pan raf kinase inhibitor and one additional undisclosed kinase inhibitor program in oncology 
we concurrently entered into a termination and transition agreement with biogen idec and millennium  pursuant to which we received an upfront  non refundable payment of million from millennium that was recorded as revenue 
under the millennium agreement  we may in the future receive up to million in pre commercialization milestone payments related to the development of the first two indications for each of the licensed products directed against the two exclusively licensed targets  and royalty payments depending on future product sales 
the agreement also provides us with future co development and co promotion rights 
in march  we licensed our lfa patents and related know how to sarcode  a privately held biopharmaceutical company 
in march  the license agreement was terminated and sarcode paid us million in cash for this intellectual property  which was recorded as revenue in april in august  
table of contents sarcode repaid three promissory notes that had been issued to us upon entering into the original license agreement 
the total amount received was million  which comprised the aggregate principal value of the three notes of million  plus million of accrued interest  which we recorded as revenue and interest income  respectively  upon receipt 
overview of operating expenses research and development expense 
most of our operating expenses to date have been for research and development activities  and include costs incurred in the preparation and execution of clinical trials  including those for vosaroxin  in the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics  in the development of novel fragment based drug discovery methods  in the development and use of in house research  preclinical study and development capabilities  in connection with in licensing activities  and in the conduct of activities related to strategic collaborations 
we expense all research and development costs as they are incurred 
we are currently focused on the development of vosaroxin for the treatment of aml 
based on results of translational research  clinical results  regulatory and competitive concerns and our overall financial resources  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which indications to pursue and patient populations to treat in the future  and how much funding to direct to each indication  which will affect our research and development expense 
we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional research expenses related to the discovery of additional product candidates  the development or application of fragment based drug discovery methods  the development of in house research capabilities  or on the clinical development of product candidates other than vosaroxin 
in addition  we are no longer conducting any research activities in connection with collaboration agreements 
however  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased levels of research and development expenses to conduct further clinical and related development of vosaroxin 
if we engage a development or commercialization partner for our vosaroxin program  or if  in the future  we acquire additional product candidates  our research and development expenses could be significantly affected 
we cannot predict whether future licensing or collaborative arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
under the restated biogen idec agreement and the millennium agreement  we have the right to participate in co development and co promotion activities for the related product candidates 
if we were to exercise our option on one or more product candidates  our research and development expense would increase significantly 
as of december   we had incurred million of expenses in the development of vosaroxin since it was licensed from dainippon sumitomo pharma co  ltd  or dainippon  in october we expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to the development of vosaroxin in and future years 
due to the above uncertainties and other risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to estimate the costs we will incur in the vosaroxin development program in the future 

table of contents general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for the related employees  including non cash stock based compensation  professional service costs  including fees paid to outside legal advisors  marketing consultants and our independent registered public accounting firm  facilities expenses  and other administrative costs 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue was million in as compared to  in revenue in was comprised of an upfront payment of million that we received from millennium in relation to the termination and transition agreement that we entered into with biogen idec and millennium in march  and million that we received as a result of the repayment by sarcode of three promissory notes that had been issued to us upon entering into a license agreement with them in march we expect our revenue to be lower in than in research and development expense 
research and development expense was million in as compared to million in  substantially all relating to the vosaroxin development program in each year 
the increase of million in was primarily due to increases of million in clinical trial expenses as a result of the ramp up of the valor trial and million for drug manufacturing activities  partially offset by a reduction in milestone payments of million 
we expect research and development expense to be higher in as compared to as we continue to conduct further clinical and related development of vosaroxin 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in as compared to million in the increase of million in was primarily due to increases of million in personnel costs and million in professional service costs 
other income expense  net 
net other income was million in as compared to net other expense of million in net other income in was primarily comprised of net non cash credits of million for the revaluation of warrants issued in the offering to their fair value as of december  net other expense in was primarily due to a non cash charge of million for the revaluation of warrants issued in the offering to their fair value as of december   partially offset by the receipt of a tax credit of million under the irs qualifying therapeutic discovery project program 
years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue decreased to  in from million in collaboration revenue of million in was primarily comprised of a million milestone earned from biogen idec s selection of a raf kinase inhibitor development candidate for the treatment of cancer 
license and other revenue of million in was primarily comprised of million from the sale to sarcode of our interest in all patents and related know how that had previously been the subject of a license agreement with them 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased to million in from million in  with substantially all of the expense in each period relating to the vosaroxin development program 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in clinical trial expenses  primarily related to the launch of the valor trial  of million and the accrual of a million milestone payment due to dainippon as a result of the initiation of the valor trial in december  which we partially offset by a reduction in facility costs of million 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in was primarily due to a restructuring plan initiated in march  or the restructuring  which resulted in a reduction of million in headcount related expenses  including million related to non cash stock compensation expense 

table of contents restructuring charges 
there were no restructuring charges in restructuring charges were million in  which included million for lease termination activities related to a corporate realignment initiated in june  or the restructuring  and million for employee severance and related benefit costs related to the restructuring 
other income expense  net 
other expense  net was million in as compared to million in the net expense in was primarily due to a non cash charge of million for the revaluation of warrants issued in the offering to their fair value as of december   partially offset by the receipt of a tax credit of million under the irs qualifying therapeutic discovery project program 
the net expense in was primarily due to non cash charges of million related to the accounting for the private placement  which consisted of million recorded upon the initial closing in april and million upon the revaluation in june of the second closing option and common equity closing option 
income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities may arise from differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their basis for financial reporting 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
our policy is to recognize interest charges and penalties as other expense 
since inception  we have incurred operating losses and  accordingly  have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes of million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carry forwards of million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards will expire at various dates beginning in and the state net operating loss will begin to expire in the state research and development tax credit carry forwards do not expire 
utilization of these net operating loss and tax credits carry forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change rules under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code 
the limitations are applicable if an ownership change  as defined in the code  is deemed to have occurred or occurs in the future 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and credit carry forwards before they can be utilized 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of common and preferred stock  debt financings  the receipt of funds from our collaboration partners  and research grants 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million as of december   as compared to million as of december  the decrease of million was primarily due to million of net cash used in operating activities  partially offset by net proceeds of million from the loan agreement as described below  and million from sales of our common stock through cantor including million from the settlement of sales made in 
in october  we entered into the loan agreement with the lenders  under which we may borrow up to million in two tranches 
the first tranche of million was funded at closing 
the second tranche of million may be drawn at our option between june  and september   subject to our continued compliance with the loan agreement and contingent upon recommendation by the dsmb following the interim analysis of the valor trial to either a discontinue the trial due to positive efficacy  or b continue the trial 

table of contents in april  we entered into a controlled equity offering sales agreement with cantor  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through cantor acting as agent and or principal 
cantor is entitled to a commission rate of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through cantor as agent under the sales agreement 
in the year ended december   we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an average price of approximately per share for gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of million  after deducting cantor s commission 
as of december   million of common stock remained available to be sold  subject to certain conditions as specified in the agreement 
in august  we entered into an additional controlled equity offering sales agreement with cantor  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through cantor acting as agent and or principal 
as of december   no sales had been made under this facility  and million of common stock remained available to be sold  subject to certain conditions as specified in the agreement 
cash flows net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to million used in and million in net cash used in resulted primarily from the net loss of million and net adjustments for non cash items of million including a net credit of million for the revaluation of warrants issued in the offering  partially offset by million of stock based compensation  partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  primarily as a result of an increase in accrued clinical expenses related to the valor trial 
net cash used in resulted primarily from the net loss of million  partially offset by net adjustments for non cash items of million including million of charges for the revaluation of warrants issued in the offering 
net cash used in resulted primarily from the net loss of million  and changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  partially offset by net adjustments for non cash items of million including million of charges related to the private placement 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  compared to million used in investing activities in and million provided by investing activities in net cash provided in consisted primarily of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities  partially offset by purchases of marketable securities 
net cash used in consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities  partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities 
net cash provided in consisted primarily of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million in and million in net cash provided in consisted primarily of net proceeds of million from the loan agreement and million from sales of our common stock through cantor 
net cash provided in consisted primarily of net proceeds of million from sales of our common stock through cantor  million from sales of our common stock in the third and final closing of the private placement  and million from the offering 
net cash provided in consisted primarily of net proceeds from the initial and second closings of the private placement 
operating cash requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
we will not receive any product revenue until a product candidate has been approved by the fda or similar regulatory agencies in other countries  and has been successfully commercialized  if at all 
we need to raise substantial additional funding to complete the development and potential commercialization of vosaroxin 
additionally  we may evaluate in licensing and acquisition opportunities to gain access to new drugs or drug targets that would fit with our strategy 
any such transaction would likely increase our funding needs in the future 

table of contents our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials  including the valor trial in particular  the need for additional or expanded clinical trials including in particular potential expansion of the number of patients included in the valor trial based on the pre specified interim analysis of data from the trial by the dsmb  the timing  economic and other terms of any licensing  collaboration or other similar arrangement into which we may enter  the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  the extent of our other development activities  the costs associated with building or accessing commercialization and additional manufacturing capabilities and supplies  the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses  product candidates and technologies  if any  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the costs  if any  of supporting our arrangements with biogen idec and millennium 
while we believe that we currently have the resources to fund our operations until the planned unblinding of the valor trial in  we may need to raise additional capital if the costs of the trial exceed our current estimates or unblinding does not occur within the currently anticipated timeframe 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of licensing or collaboration or product revenue to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through equity issuances  debt arrangements  a possible license  collaboration or other similar arrangement with respect to development and or commercialization rights to vosaroxin  or a combination of the above 
our failure to raise significant additional capital in the future would force us to delay or reduce the scope of our vosaroxin development program  potentially including the valor trial  and or limit or cease our operations 
any one of the foregoing would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt obligations  including interest operating lease obligations upon the occurrence of an event of default  as defined in the loan agreement  and following any applicable cure periods  a default interest rate of an additional may be applied to the outstanding loan balances  and the lenders may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the loan agreement 

table of contents operating lease obligations relate solely to the lease of approximately  square feet of office space in a building at oyster point boulevard in south san francisco  california  which is currently our corporate headquarters
