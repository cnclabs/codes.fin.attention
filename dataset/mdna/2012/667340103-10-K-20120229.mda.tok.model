item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management of market risk 
historically low interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability 
during the past three years it has been the policy of the federal reserve board to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage backed securities 
as a result  market rates on the loans we have originated and the yields on securities we have purchased have been at lower levels than available prior to as a general matter  our interest bearing liabilities re price or mature more quickly than our interest earning assets  which has been one factor contributing to the increase in our interest rate spread as interest rates decreased 
however  our ability to lower our interest expense will be limited at these interest rate levels while the average yield on our interest earning assets may continue to decrease 
the federal reserve board has recently indicated its intention to maintain low interest rates until at least late accordingly  our net interest income may be adversely affected and may even decrease  which may have an adverse effect on our profitability 
if the allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
our customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms  and the collateral  if any  securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance 
we may experience significant loan losses  which may have a material adverse effect on operating results 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in additions to the allowance 
material additions to the allowance would materially decrease net income 
our emphasis on originating commercial real estate and commercial loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating the allowance for loan losses 
as we continue to increase the amount of such loans  increased provisions for loan losses may be necessary which would decrease our earnings 
bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase to the provision for loan losses or further loan charge offs 
any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we could record future losses on our investment securities portfolio 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of impairment losses on investment securities  of which million was recognized as other comprehensive loss in the equity section of our balance sheet  and  was recognized as a reduction to noninterest income in our income statement 
at december   we held corporate debt securities and non government agency collateralized mortgage obligations with net unrealized holding losses of million and  respectively 
a number of factors or combinations of factors could require us to conclude in one or more future reporting periods that an unrealized loss that exists with respect to these securities constitutes an impairment that is other than temporary  which could result in material losses to us 
these factors include  but are not limited to  failure by the 
table of contents issuer to make scheduled interest payments  an increase in the severity of the unrealized loss on a particular security  an increase in the continuous duration of the unrealized loss without an improvement in value or changes in market conditions and or industry or issuer specific factors that would render us unable to forecast a full recovery in value 
in addition  the fair values of securities could decline if the overall economy and the financial condition of some of the issuers continues to deteriorate and there remains limited liquidity for these securities 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations balance sheet analysis securities for a discussion of our securities portfolio and the unrealized losses related to the portfolio  as well as the marketable securities and disclosures about fair value of financial instruments footnotes to the audited financial statements 
we hold certain intangible assets that could be classified as impaired in the future 
if these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future  the book values of these assets would have to be written down and the amount of the write down would decrease earnings 
we are required to test our goodwill and core deposit intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis and more regularly if indicators of impairment exist 
the impairment testing process considers a variety of factors  including the current market price of our common shares  the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities and information concerning the terminal valuation of similar insured depository institutions 
future impairment testing may result in a partial or full impairment of the value of our goodwill or core deposit intangible assets  or both 
if an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period  our earnings and the book value of these intangible assets will be reduced by the amount of the impairment 
however  the recording of such an impairment loss would have no impact on the tangible book value of our shares of common stock or our regulatory capital levels 
strong competition may limit growth and profitability 
competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense 
we compete with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere 
many of these competitors whether regional or national institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide 
our profitability depends upon our ability to successfully compete in our market areas 
future legislative or regulatory actions responding to perceived financial and market problems could impair our ability to foreclose on collateral 
there have been proposals made by members of congress and others that would reduce the amount distressed borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay under their mortgage loans and limit an institution s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral 
were proposals such as these  or other proposals limiting our rights as a creditor  to be implemented  we could experience increased credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor 
our exposure to municipalities may lead to operating losses 
our municipal bond portfolio may be impacted by the effects of economic stress on state and local governments 
at december   we had million invested in obligations of states  municipalities and political subdivisions collectively referred to as our municipal bond portfolio 
we also had million of loans outstanding and million of unfunded commitments  open lines of credit and letters of credit to municipalities and political subdivisions 
widespread concern currently exists regarding the stress on state and local governments emanating from i declining revenues  ii large unfunded liabilities to government workers  and iii entrenched cost structures 
debt to gross domestic product ratios for the majority of states have been deteriorating due to  among other factors i declines in federal monetary assistance provided as the united states is currently experiencing the largest deficit in its history  and ii lower levels of sales and property tax revenue as unemployment remains elevated and the housing market continues to remain unstable 
this concern has led to speculation about the potential for a significant deterioration in the municipal bond market  which could materially 
table of contents affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we may not be able to mitigate the exposure in our municipal portfolio if state and local governments are unable to fulfill their obligations 
the risk of widespread issuer defaults may also increase if there are changes in legislation that permit states  or additional municipalities and political subdivisions  to file for bankruptcy protection or if there are judicial interpretations that  in a bankruptcy or other proceeding  lessen the value of any structural protections 
the standard poor s downgrade in the us government s sovereign credit rating  and in the credit ratings of instruments issued  insured or guaranteed by certain related institutions  agencies and instrumentalities  could result in risks to the company and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict 
on august   standard poor s downgraded the united states long term debt rating from its aaa rating to aa 
on august   standard poor s downgraded the credit ratings of certain long term debt instruments issued by fannie mae and freddie mac and other us government agencies linked to long term us debt 
instruments of this nature are key assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions  including the bank 
these downgrades could adversely affect the market value of such instruments  and could adversely impact our ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments  as well as affecting the pricing of that funding when it is available 
we cannot predict if  when or how these changes to the credit ratings will affect economic conditions 
these ratings downgrades could result in a significant adverse impact to the company  and could exacerbate the other risks to which we are subject  including those described above 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption  or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan  and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption  or security breach of our information systems  we cannot assure you that any such failures  interruptions  or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions  or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and the business community and making loans secured by various types of collateral  including real estate and other consumer assets in the markets in which we operate 
attracting and maintaining deposits is affected by a number of factors  including interest rates paid on competing investments offered by other financial and non financial institutions  account maturities  fee structures  and levels of personal income and savings 
lending activities are affected by the demand for funds and thus are influenced by interest rates  the number and quality of lenders and regional economic conditions 
sources of funds for lending activities include deposits  borrowings  repayments on loans  cash flows from investment securities and income provided from operations 
our earnings depend primarily on our level of net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of loans and investment securities  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits  borrowed funds  and trust preferred securities 
net interest income is a function of our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities  as well as a function of the average balance of interest earning assets compared to the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
also contributing to our earnings is noninterest income  which consists primarily of service charges and fees on loan and deposit products and services  fees related to insurance and investment management and trust services  and net gains and losses on the sale of assets 
net interest income and noninterest income are offset by provisions for loan losses  general administrative and other expenses  including employee compensation and benefits and occupancy and equipment costs  as well as by state and federal income tax expense 
our net income was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  and million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the loan loss provision was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges for securities  which were reflected as a reduction of noninterest income  of  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we did not significantly change our underwriting standards in the past several years nor did we add controversial residential loan products 
other than our loans for the construction of one to four family residential mortgage loans  we do not solicit interest only mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties where the borrower pays interest for an initial period  after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan 
we also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal  such as option arm loans  where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan  resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan 
we do not directly offer subprime loans loans that generally target borrowers with fico scores of less than or alt a loans traditionally defined as loans having less than full documentation 
however  a portion of the loans originated by one of our subsidiaries  northwest consumer discount company ncdc  consists of loans to persons with credit scores that would cause such loans to be considered subprime 
ncdc has been in operation for over years and has offices throughout pennsylvania 
ncdc offers a variety of consumer loans for automobiles  appliances and furniture as well as residential mortgage loans 
at december   ncdc s total loan portfolio was approximately million with an average loan size of  an average fico score of and an average yield of approximately 
ncdc s total delinquency has remained steady at approximately of outstanding loans  with loans nonperforming for days or more at of loans outstanding 
annual net charge offs average approximately million  or of outstanding loans  and it maintains an allowance for loan losses of million  or of loans 
although loans originated through ncdc have higher average rates of delinquency and charge offs than similar loans originated directly by northwest savings bank  management believes that the higher yields on loans originated through ncdc compensate for the incremental credit risk exposure 

table of contents critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are important to the understanding of our financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances  including  but without limitation  changes in interest rates  performance of the economy  financial condition of borrowers and laws and regulations 
the following are the accounting policies we believe are critical 
allowance for loan losses 
we recognize that losses will be experienced on loans and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan  the creditworthiness of the borrower  general economic conditions and the quality of the collateral for the loan 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses based on all available information 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio  including past loan loss experience  known and inherent losses  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  and current economic conditions 
the loan portfolio and other credit exposures are regularly reviewed by management in its determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance includes a review of historical losses  peer group comparisons  industry data and economic conditions 
as an integral part of their examination process  regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to make additional provisions for estimated losses based upon judgments different from those of management 
in establishing the allowance for loan losses  loss factors are applied to various pools of outstanding loans 
loss factors are derived using our historical loss experience and may be adjusted for factors that affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
commercial loans over million that are criticized are evaluated individually to determine the required allowance for loan losses and to evaluate the potential impairment 
although management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed previously 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the allowance is based on information known at the time of the review 
changes in factors underlying the assessment could have a material impact on the amount of the allowance that is necessary and the amount of provision to be charged against earnings 
such changes could impact future results 
management believes that all known losses as of december  and have been recorded as of those dates 
valuation of investment securities 
our investment securities are classified as either held to maturity or available for sale 
held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost  while available for sale securities are carried at fair value 
unrealized gains or losses  net of deferred taxes  are reported in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
in general  fair value is based upon quoted market prices of identical assets  when available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair value is based upon valuation models that use cash flow  security structure and other observable information 
where sufficient data is not available to produce a fair valuation  fair value is based on broker quotes for similar assets 
annually  we validate the prices received from these third parties by comparing them to prices provided by a different independent pricing service 
we have also reviewed the detailed valuation methodologies provided to us by our pricing services 
broker quotes may be adjusted to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value 
adjustments may include unobservable parameters  among other things 
no adjustments were made to any broker quotes received by us 
we conduct a quarterly review and evaluation of all investment securities to determine if any declines in fair value are other than temporary 
in making this determination  we consider the period of time the securities were in a loss position  the percentage decline in comparison to the securities amortized cost  the financial condition of the issuer  if applicable  and the delinquency or default rates of underlying collateral 
we consider our intent to sell the investment securities evaluated and the likelihood that we will not have to sell the investment securities before recovery of their cost basis 
if impairment exists  credit related impairment losses are recorded in earnings while noncredit related impairment losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
any future deterioration in the fair value of an investment security  or the determination that the existing unrealized loss of an investment security is other than temporary  may have a material adverse affect on future earnings 

table of contents goodwill 
goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be tested for impairment at least annually  and possibly more frequently if certain events or changes in circumstances arise 
impairment testing requires that the fair value of each reporting unit be compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
reporting units are identified based upon analyzing each of our individual operating segments 
a reporting unit is defined as any distinct  separately identifiable component of an operating segment for which complete  discrete financial information is available that management regularly reviews 
goodwill is allocated to the carrying value of each reporting unit based on its relative fair value at the time it is acquired 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires a high degree of subjective management judgment 
with the assistance of an independent third party  we evaluate goodwill for possible impairment using four valuation methodologies including a public market peers approach  a comparable transactions approach  a control premium approach and a discounted cash flow approach 
future changes in the economic environment or the operations of the reporting units could cause changes to these variables  which could give rise to declines in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
declines in fair value could result in impairment being identified 
we have established june of each year as the date for conducting our annual goodwill impairment assessment 
quarterly  we evaluate if there are any triggering events that would require an update to our previous assessment 
the variables are selected as of that date and the valuation model is run to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we did not identify any individual reporting unit where the fair value was less than the carrying value 
deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
using this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is established 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income 
the judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets  which are inherently subjective  are reviewed on an ongoing basis as regulatory and business factors change 
a reduction in estimated future taxable income could require us to record a valuation allowance 
changes in levels of valuation allowances could result in increased income tax expense  and could negatively affect earnings 
pension benefits 
pension expense and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  anticipated salary increases  interest costs  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from the assumptions are amortized over average future service and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension obligations and future expense 
in determining the projected benefit obligations for pension benefits at december  and  we used a discount rate of and  respectively 
we use the citigroup pension liability index rates matching the duration of our benefit payments as of the measurement date to determine the discount rate 
our measurement date is december

table of contents we review our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for indications of impairment 
this review includes analyzing the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been lower than the cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer 
in addition  management must assert that it does not have the intent to sell the security and that it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis 
other investments are evaluated using our best estimate of future cash flows 
if our estimate of cash flow determines that it is expected an adverse change has occurred  other than temporary impairment would be recognized for the credit loss 
the following table shows the fair value and gross unrealized losses on our investment securities  aggregated by investment category and length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at december  less than months months or more total unrealized unrealized unrealized fair value loss fair value loss fair value loss in thousands us government and agencies municipal securities corporate issues equity securities residential mortgage backed securities non agency residential mortgage backed securities agency total temporarily impaired securities as of december   we had six investments in corporate issues with a total book value of million and total fair value of million  where book value exceeded carrying value for more than months 
these investments were two single issuer trust preferred investments and four pooled trust preferred investments 
the single issuer trust preferred investments were evaluated for other than temporary impairment by determining the strength of the underlying issuer 
in each case  the underlying issuer was well capitalized for regulatory purposes  none of the issuers have deferred interest payments or announced the intention to defer interest payments 
we believe the decline in fair value is related to the spread over three month libor  on which the quarterly interest payments are based  as the spread over libor is significantly lower than current market spreads 
we concluded the impairment of these investments was considered temporary 
in making that determination  we also considered the duration and the severity of the losses

we determined how much of the impairment was credit related and noncredit related by analyzing cash flow estimates  estimated prepayment speeds  loss severity and conditional default rates 
we consider the discounted cash flow analysis to be our primary evidence when determining whether credit related other than temporary impairment exists 
the impairment on the other seven collateralized mortgage obligations  with book value of million and fair value of million  were also reviewed considering the severity and length of impairment 
after this review  we determined that the impairment on these seven securities was temporary

we review our portfolio of municipal securities quarterly for impairment 
we initially evaluate investments in municipal securities for other than temporary impairment by comparing the fair value  provided to us by two third party pricing source using quoted prices for similar assets that are actively traded  to the carrying value 
when an investment s fair value is below of the carrying value we then compare the stated interest rate to current market interest rates to determine if the decline in fair value is attributable to interest rates 
if the stated interest rate approximates current interest rates for similar securities  we determine if the investment is rated and if so  if the rating has changed in the current period 
if the rating has not changed during the current period  we review publicly available information to determine if there has been any negative change in the underlying municipality 
as of december   we have determined that all of the impairment in our municipal securities portfolio is noncredit related and therefore temporary

table of contents asset quality we actively manage asset quality through our underwriting practices and collection procedures 
our underwriting practices are focused on balancing risk and return while our collection operatives focus on diligently working with delinquent borrowers in an effort to minimize losses 
collection procedures 
our collection procedures for personal loans generally provide that when a loan is five days past due  a computer generated late notice is sent to the borrower requesting payment 
if delinquency continues  at days a delinquent notice  plus a notice of a late charge  is sent and personal contact efforts are attempted  either in person or by telephone  to strengthen the collection process and obtain reasons for the delinquency 
also  plans to establish a payment plan are developed 
personal contact efforts are continued throughout the collection process  as necessary 
generally  if a loan becomes days past due  a collection letter is sent and the loan becomes subject to possible legal action if suitable arrangements for payment have not been made 
in addition  the borrower is given information which provides access to consumer counseling services to the extent required by the regulations of the department of housing and urban development 
when a loan continues in a delinquent status for days or more  and a payment schedule has not been developed or kept by the borrower  we may send the borrower a notice of intent to foreclose  giving days to cure the delinquency 
if not cured  foreclosure proceedings are initiated 
nonperforming assets 
loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed on a nonaccrual status when  in the opinion of management  the collection of additional principal and or interest is doubtful 
loans are automatically placed on nonaccrual status when either principal or interest is days or more past due 
interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on a nonaccrual status is reversed and charged against interest income 
real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time that it is sold 
when real estate is acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure  it is recorded at the lower of the related loan balance or its fair value as determined by an appraisal  less estimated costs of disposal 
if the value of the property is less than the loan  less any related specific loan loss reserve allocations  the difference is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
any subsequent write down of real estate owned or loss at the time of disposition is charged against earnings

our policies  consistent with regulatory guidelines  provide for the classification of loans considered to be of lesser quality as substandard  doubtful  or loss assets 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the savings institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible so that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
assets that do not expose the savings institution to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but which possess some weaknesses  are required to be designated special mention 
at december   we had loans  with an aggregate principal balance of million  designated as special mention 
we regularly review our asset portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations 
our largest classified assets generally are also our largest nonperforming assets 
the following table sets forth the aggregate amount of our classified assets at the dates indicated 
at december  in thousands substandard assets doubtful assets loss assets total classified assets allowance for loan losses 
our board of directors has approved an allowance for loan losses policy designed to provide management with a systematic methodology for determining and documenting the allowance for loan losses each reporting period 
this methodology was developed to provide a consistent process and review procedure to ensure that the allowance for loan losses is in conformity with gaap  our policies and procedures and other supervisory and regulatory guidelines 
on an ongoing basis  the credit administration department  as well as loan officers  branch managers and department heads  review and monitor the loan portfolio for problem loans 
this portfolio monitoring includes a 
table of contents review of the monthly delinquency reports as well as historical comparisons and trend analysis 
on an on going basis the loan officer along with the credit administration department grades or classifies problem loans or potential problem loans based upon their knowledge of the lending relationship and other information previously accumulated 
loans that have been classified as substandard or doubtful are reviewed by the credit administration department for possible impairment 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement including both contractual principal and interest payments 
our loan grading system for problem loans is described above in classification of assets 
if an individual loan is deemed to be impaired  we determine the proper measurement of impairment for each loan based on one of three methods the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if the measure of the impaired loan is more or less than the recorded investment in the loan  we adjust the specific allowance associated with that individual loan accordingly 
if a substandard or doubtful loan is not considered individually for impairment  it is grouped with other loans that possess common characteristics for impairment evaluation and analysis 
this segmentation is accomplished by grouping loans of similar product types  risk characteristics and industry concentration into homogeneous pools 
each pool is then analyzed based on the historical delinquency  charge off and recovery trends over the past three years which are then extended to include the loss realization period during which the event of default occurs  additional consideration is also given to the current economic  political  regulatory and interest rate environment 
this adjusted historical net charge off amount as a percentage of loans outstanding for each group is used to estimate the measure of impairment 
the individual impairment measures along with the estimated losses for each homogeneous pool are consolidated into one summary document 
this summary schedule along with the supporting documentation used to establish this schedule is prepared monthly and presented to the credit committee on a quarterly basis 
the credit committee is comprised of members of senior management from our various departments  including mortgage  consumer and commercial lending  appraising  administration and finance as well as our president and chief executive officer 
the credit committee reviews the processes and documentation presented  reviews the concentration of credit by industry and customer  discusses lending products  activity  competition and collateral values  as well as economic conditions in general and in each of our market areas 
based on this review and discussion  the appropriate allowance for loan losses is estimated and any adjustments necessary to reconcile the actual allowance for loan losses with this estimate are determined 
in addition  the credit committee considers whether any changes to the methodology are needed 
the credit committee also compares our delinquency trends  nonperforming asset amounts and allowance for loan loss levels to our peer group and to state and national statistics 
a similar review is also performed by the risk management committee of the board of directors 
in addition to the reviews by the credit committee and the risk management committee  regulators from either the federal deposit insurance corporation or pennsylvania state department of banking perform a review on an annual basis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and its conformity with regulatory guidelines and pronouncements 
the internal audit department also performs a regular review of the detailed supporting schedules for accuracy and reports their findings to the audit committee of the board of directors 
any recommendations or enhancements from these independent parties are considered by management and the credit committee and implemented accordingly 
we acknowledge that this is a dynamic process and consists of factors  many of which are external and beyond our control  which can change 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon estimates using all the information previously discussed as well as current and known circumstances and events 
there is no assurance that actual portfolio losses will not be substantially different than those that were estimated 
we believe that all known losses as of december  and have been recorded 
we utilize a consistent methodology each period when analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses 
as part of the analysis  we considered the economic data in our markets such as the unemployment and bankruptcies levels as well as the changes in real estate collateral values 
in addition  we considered the overall trend in asset quality  loan charge offs and the allowance for loan losses as a 
table of contents percentage of nonperforming loans 
we also consider the specific reserves already established for criticized loans based upon a three year average of historical charge offs during a period of time in which we have experienced the highest amount of loan losses in our history 
as a result  we decreased the allowance for loan losses during the year by million  or  to million  or of total loans  at december  from million  or of total loans  at december  the decrease in the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses is discussed above in the section provision for loan losses

table of contents allocation of allowance for loan losses 
the following tables set forth the allocation of allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated 
the allowance for loan losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category 
effective january   we revised our methodology for calculating the allowance for loan losses 
prior to that date  we established the allowance for loan losses based on ranges applicable to various loan categories as opposed to single amounts applicable to the loan categories  which resulted in our not having an unallocated component of the allowance prior to that date

liquidity and capital resources northwest savings bank is required to maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets  as determined by management and defined and reviewed for adequacy by the federal deposit insurance corporation during their regular examinations 
the federal deposit insurance corporation  however  does not prescribe by regulation a minimum amount or percentage of liquid assets 
the federal deposit insurance corporation allows us to consider any marketable security  whose sale would not impair our capital adequacy  to be eligible for liquidity 
liquidity is monitored through the use of a standard liquidity ratio of liquid assets to borrowings plus deposits 
using this formula  northwest savings bank s liquidity ratio was as of december  we adjust our liquidity level in order to meet funding needs of deposit outflows  repayment of borrowings and loan commitments 
we also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet our asset and liability management objectives 
liquidity needs can also be met by temporarily drawing upon lines of credit established for such reasons 
as of december   northwest savings bank had billion of additional borrowing capacity available with the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  including a million overnight line of credit  as well as a million borrowing capacity available with the federal reserve bank and million with two correspondent banks 

table of contents in addition to deposits  our primary sources of funds are the amortization and repayment of loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and earnings and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rate levels  economic conditions  and competition 
we manage the pricing of our deposits to maintain a desired deposit balance 
in addition  we invest excess funds in short term interest earning and other assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
short term interest earning deposits amounted to million at december  for additional information about our cash flows from operating  financing  and investing activities  see the statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
a portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  which are a product of our operating  investing  and financing activities 
the primary sources of cash during the current year were net income  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and increases in deposit accounts 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh and the federal reserve bank of cleveland  which provide an additional source of funds 
at december  northwest savings bank had advances of million from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh 
we borrow from the these sources to reduce interest rate risk and to provide liquidity when necessary 
at december   our customers had million of unused lines of credit available and million in loan commitments 
this amount does not include the unfunded portion of loans in process 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year at december   totaled billion 
we believe that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us 
the major sources of our cash flows are in the areas of loans  marketable securities  deposits and borrowed funds 
deposits are our primary source of externally generated funds 
the level of deposit inflows during any given period is heavily influenced by factors outside of our control  such as consumer savings tendencies  the general level of short term and long term market interest rates  as well as higher alternative yields that investors may obtain on competing investments such as money market mutual funds 
financial institutions  such as northwest savings bank  are also subject to deposit outflows 
our net deposits increased by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
similarly  the amount of principal repayments on loans and the amount of new loan originations is heavily influenced by the general level of market interest rates 
funds received from loan maturities and principal payments on loans for the years ended december   and were billion  billion and billion  respectively 
loan originations for the years ended december   and were billion  billion and billion  respectively 
we also sell a portion of the loans we originate  and the cash flows from such sales for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
we experience significant cash flows from our portfolio of marketable securities as principal payments are received on mortgage backed securities and as investment securities mature or are called 
cash flow from the repayment of principal and the maturity or call of marketable securities for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
when necessary  we utilize borrowings as a source of liquidity and as a source of funds for long term investment when market conditions permit 
the net cash flow from the receipt and repayment of borrowings were net decreases of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents other activity with respect to cash flow was the payment of cash dividends on common stock in the amount of million  million and million for the ended december   and  respectively 
at december   stockholders equity totaled billion

we monitor the capital levels of northwest savings bank to provide for current and future business opportunities and to meet regulatory guidelines for well capitalized institutions 
northwest savings bank is required by the pennsylvania state department of banking and the fdic to meet minimum capital adequacy requirements 
at december   northwest savings bank exceeded all regulatory minimum capital requirements and is considered to be well capitalized 
in addition  as of december   we were not aware of any recommendation by a regulatory authority that  if it were implemented  would have a material effect on liquidity  capital resources or operations 
regulatory capital requirements 
northwest savings bank is subject to minimum capital requirements established by the federal deposit insurance corporation

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or re price within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or re pricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to positively affect net interest income 
similarly  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to positively affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
our policy is to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk generally by better matching the maturities of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and by increasing the interest rate sensitivity of our interest earning assets 
we purchase adjustable rate investment securities and mortgage backed securities which at december  totaled million  and originate adjustable rate mortgage loans  adjustable rate consumer loans  and adjustable rate commercial loans  which at december   totaled billion or of our gross loan portfolio 
of 
table of contents our billion of interest earning assets at december   billion  or  consisted of assets with adjustable rates of interest 
when market conditions are favorable  we also attempt to reduce interest rate risk by lengthening the maturities of our interest bearing liabilities by using fhlb advances as a source of long term fixed rate funds  and by promoting longer term certificates of deposit 
at december   total interest earning assets maturing or re pricing within one year exceeded total interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing in the same period by million  representing a positive one year gap ratio of 
we have an asset liability committee with members consisting of various individuals from senior management 
this committee meets monthly in an effort to effectively manage our balance sheet and to monitor activity and set pricing 
we also have a risk management committee comprised of certain members of the board of directors  which among other things  is responsible for reviewing our level of interest rate risk 
the committee meets quarterly and  as part of their risk management assessment  reviews interest rate risks and trends  our interest sensitivity position and the liquidity and market value of our investment portfolio 
the following table sets forth  on a carrying value basis  the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are expected to re price or mature  based upon certain assumptions  in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown that re price or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the term of re pricing or the contractual term of the asset or liability 
we believe that these assumptions approximate the standards used in the savings industry and consider them appropriate and reasonable

table of contents we have an asset liability committee  consisting of several members of management  which meets monthly to review market interest rates  economic conditions  the pricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and our balance sheet structure 
on a quarterly basis  this committee also reviews our interest rate risk position and our cash flow projections 
our board of directors has a risk management committee  which meets quarterly and reviews interest rate risks and trends  our interest sensitivity position  our liquidity position and the market risk inherent in our investment portfolio 
in an effort to assess market risk  we use a simulation model to determine the effect of immediate incremental increases and decreases in interest rates on net income and the market value of our equity 
certain assumptions are made regarding loan prepayments and decay rates of passbook and now accounts 
because it is difficult to accurately project the market reaction of depositors and borrowers  the effect of actual changes in interest rates on these assumptions may differ from simulated results 
we have established the following guidelines for assessing interest rate risk net income simulation 
given a non parallel shift of in interest rates  the estimated net income may not decrease by more than within a one year period 
market value of equity simulation 
the market value of our equity is the present value of our assets and liabilities 
given a non parallel shift of in interest rates  the market value of equity may not decrease by more than from the computed economic value at current interest rate levels 
the following table illustrates the simulated impact of a non parallel or upward or or downward movement in interest rates on net income  return on average equity  earnings per share and market value of equity 
these analyses were prepared assuming that total interest earning asset levels at december  remain constant  while million of interest earning overnight funds will be deployed to loans and investments over the next months 
the impact of the rate movements was computed by simulating the effect of an immediate and sustained shift in interest rates over a twelve month period from december  levels 
non parallel shift in interest rates increase decrease shift in interest rates over the next months projected percentage increase decrease in net income projected increase decrease in return on average equity projected increase decrease in earnings per share projected percentage increase decrease in market value of equity the figures included in the tables above represent projections that were computed based upon certain assumptions including prepayment rates and decay rates 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  we cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates 
actual results may differ significantly due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions 
when assessing our interest rate sensitivity  analysis of historical trends indicates that loans will prepay at various speeds or annual rates depending on the variance between the weighted average portfolio rates and the current market rates 
in preparing the table above  the following assumptions were used i adjustable rate mortgage loans will prepay at an annual rate of to  ii fixed rate mortgage loans will prepay at an annual rate of to  depending on the type of loan  iii commercial loans will prepay at an annual rate of to  iv consumer loans held by northwest savings bank will prepay at an annual rate of to  and v consumer loans held by ncdc will prepay at an annual rate of to 
in regards to our deposits  it has been assumed that i fixed maturity deposits will not be withdrawn prior to maturity  ii the significant majority of money market accounts will re price immediately  iii savings accounts will gradually re price over three years  and iv checking accounts will re price either when the rates on such accounts re price as interest rate levels change  or 
table of contents when deposit holders withdraw funds from such accounts and select other types of deposit accounts  such as certificate accounts  which may have higher interest rates 
for purposes of this analysis  management has estimated  based on historical trends  that million of our checking accounts and million of our savings accounts are interest sensitive and may re price in one year or less  and that the remainder may re price over longer time periods 
the above assumptions are annual percentages based on remaining balances and should not be regarded as indicative of the actual prepayments and withdrawals that we may experience 
moreover  certain shortcomings are inherent in the analysis presented by the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re pricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of or lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as some adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
moreover  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
in addition  we regularly measure and monitor the market value of our net assets and the changes therein 
while fluctuations are expected because of changes in interest rates  we have established policy limits for various interest rate scenarios 
given interest rate shocks of to basis points the market value of net assets is not expected to decrease by more than to 
off balance sheet arrangements as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make 
in addition  we routinely enter into commitments to purchase and sell residential mortgage loans
