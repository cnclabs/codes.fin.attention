item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we are a canadian corporation  with principal assets and operations in the united states  whose primary business is developing  manufacturing and selling our nano lithium titanate battery cells  batteries and battery systems and providing related design  installation and test services 
our primary focus is marketing our large scale energy storage solutions to power companies and electric grid operators throughout the world 
in addition  we market our batteries to electric and hybrid electric bus manufacturers  and are working to expand into new industrial markets 
starting in we began looking at additional opportunities to expand the application of our battery technology into various industrial markets that have a need for the attributes of our battery technology 
we believe that in the aggregate  our target markets are multi billion dollar emerging markets with room for a number of successful suppliers 
at the present time  we perceive no dominant provider and we believe that as a result of our significant differentiated product attributes  the overall strength of our management team  and the recognition we are receiving in the marketplace  that we have a very good chance of becoming one of the successful suppliers 
our proprietary technology platform gives our products a number of unique  highly sought after attributes that clearly differentiate our products from their alternatives 
included in these attributes are substantially longer cycle and calendar lives  a rapid recharge time  the ability to provide instantaneous high power  a wide operating temperature range and increased operational safety 
our historical revenues have been generated by license fees  product sales  commercial collaborations  and government contracts and grants 
we expect future revenues to consist primarily of product sales 
we currently have agreements in place to develop a suite of energy storage solutions for the stationary power market  provide battery modules to a us based bus manufacturer and are negotiating agreements to develop battery modules for various other industrial applications  supply a one megawatt alti ess energy storage system for a test of wind energy integration and supply our nano lithium titanate powder to an early stage chinese battery manufacturer affiliated with canon although deliveries under such agreement are suspended and expect to remain suspended in the foreseeable future  we have also sold a battery system and battery cells under this agreement 
in  we plan to form one or more wholly foreign owned enterprises wfoe in china 
in  our board of directors approved a business plan that included the expansion of business activities into china 
we anticipate this expansion will allow us to participate in the fast growing china market 
we have decided to consolidate our operations  including closing our reno  nv corporate headquarters and combining its corporate functions with our anderson  in facility  for greater efficiency and cost reductions 
general outlook we have generated net losses in each fiscal year since incorporation 
revenues from product sales increased from million in to million in  as a result of continued sales to proterra and increased sales to yte 
commercial collaborations  contracts and grants decreased million from million in to  in  as we wrapped up us army nanosensor grant work 
as a condition to closing the canon investment we have had to abandon all future military business 
we completed our contract with the us office of naval research and most of our nanosensor grant during our current focus is on the development of products in energy storage that we anticipate will eventually bring a substantial amount of higher margin revenues from product sales 
we expect our nano lithium titanate batteries and battery systems to be the source of such higher margin revenues 
as we attempt to significantly expand our revenues from licensing  manufacturing and other sources  some of the key near term events that will affect our long term success prospects include the following based on the success of the aes megawatt frequency regulation trial  as validated in the kema  inc analysis and report  we have experienced a substantial amount of interest in our large scale battery systems from other entities and are in active sales development discussions with a number of them 
in  we accepted purchase orders to supply the university of hawaii hawaii natural energy institute hnei with two megawatt alti ess energy storage system for a test of wind and solar energy integration 
we anticipate shipping one of these systems in the third quarter of and the other in the fourth quarter of on february   we also signed a contract with inversiones energ ticas  sa de sa ine for the supply and installation of a ten megawatt alti ess advanced battery system in el salvador 
total revenues under the contract are million to be recognized over an expected month period following altair s receipt of the notice to proceed 
we anticipate receiving this notice to proceed during the second quarter of under the contract  we are responsible for virtually all of the design  supply  labor  installation and commission of the advanced battery system 
we will provide a one year warranty for the entire system and an additional two year warranty for the batteries and control system 
this project was delayed in as a result of obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to enable energy storage on the el salvador electric grid 
we believe necessary regulatory approvals will be received in the second quarter of permitting the project to move forward 
in june  we signed a contract with proterra  llc  a golden  colorado based leading designer and manufacturer of heavy duty drive systems  energy storage systems  vehicle control systems and transit buses to sell them battery modules for their all electric and hybrid electric buses 
proterra s systems are scalable to all forms of commercial buses and class trucks 
during we sold million of battery modules to proterra 
in we sold million of battery modules to proterra 
we do not expect to sell additional battery modules to proterra during as they work through their inventory of battery modules 
we anticipate battery module sales to expand to proterra in and future years as they gradually scale up their business 
based on the demonstrated success of our battery in the proterra bus application  we have also entered into discussions with a number of other bus manufacturers or systems integrators regarding joint development products or purchases of our battery products for transportation applications 
we are in discussions with a number of industrial manufacturers of forklifts  elevators and other electric equipment whose use requires the long life  rapid recharge  extreme operating temperature range or other differentiating attributes of our battery technology 
although it is not essential that all of these markets become successful for our battery technology in order to permit substantial long term revenue growth  we believe that full commercialization of several of our battery applications will be necessary in order to expand our revenues enough to create a likelihood of our becoming profitable in the long term 
we remain optimistic with respect to our current key projects  as well as others we are pursuing  but recognize that  with respect to each  there are development  marketing  partnering and other risks to be overcome 
liquidity and capital resources current and expected liquidity as of december   we had cash totaling million 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in operating activities for compared to was due in part primarily to an increase in trade account payables million  mostly the result of two outstanding and disputed vendor payments  offset by a decrease in deferred revenues of million in part from yte product shipments made in investing activities for the year ended december  reflect the purchase of property and equipment totaling  our cash and short term investments increased by million  from million at december  to million at december   due primarily to the canon investment of million  offset by cash used in operations of million 
on march  we issued common shares and warrants to purchase common shares for net proceeds of million 
we initially recorded a million warrant liability related to this capital raise and adjusted this warrant liability s fair value down to million as of december  we also received net cash proceeds of million on a note payable secured by our reno  nv facility during april during the nine months ending september  we made the last  payment on our original reno building mortgage 
in relation to the canon investment  we are required to pay a placement agent fee of between  and million  the amount of which is subject to pending litigation  and we are disputing an additional claimed finder s fee of million  which is also subject to pending litigation 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
the net source of cash from financing activities of million for the year ended december  primarily reflects the issuance of common shares  net of issuance costs  for million 
the difference of 
million relates to a net decrease in notes payable and warrants redeemed 
on march  we issued common shares and warrants to purchase common shares for net proceeds of million 
we initially recorded a million warrant liability related to this capital raise and adjusted this warrant liability s fair value down to million as of december  we also received net cash proceeds of million on a note payable secured by our reno  nv facility during april during the nine months ending september  we made the last  payment on our original reno building mortgage 
in  energy storage technology china group limited  an indirect subsidiary of canon  purchased  shares for million 
these proceeds are available to support continuing operations and to invest in manufacturing and product sales efforts in china 
we are currently evaluating manufacturing and product market opportunities in china and expect a significant portion of the proceeds received from canon will be used to capitalize a wholly foreign owned entity  or wfoe  in china 
because of legal limitations on the repatriation of funds used to capitalize a wfoe  if a significant portion of available funds are invested in china  we would likely need to raise capital or obtain financing in to fund our china expansion as well as sustain our us operations 
we plan to retain funds in our us operations sufficient to fund us operations  prior to sending any funds to china 
we evaluate our capital needs and the availability of capital on an ongoing basis and  consistent with past practice  expect to seek capital when and on such terms as we deem appropriate based upon our assessment of our current liquidity  capital needs and the availability of capital 
given that we are not yet in a positive cash flow or earnings position  the options available to us are fewer than to a positive cash flow company 
specifically  we would not generally qualify for long term institutional debt financing 
consistent with past practice we expect to raise additional capital through the sale of common shares  convertible notes  stock options  and warrants 
we do not expect the current economic environment to preclude our ability to raise capital  but the overall cost to the company of doing so will most likely be high 
to the extent we expect shortages in capital and do not have significant order volume  purchases of raw materials would be discontinued and other measures to conserve cash would be implemented as necessary to extend cash availability 
other measures to preserve cash on hand as required would include the following reducing production levels  deferring discretionary expenditures such as capital purchases  internal research costs  training  and routine equipment and building maintenance  eliminating or deferring the filling of non critical positions through attrition  and reductions in workforce 
over the long term  we anticipate substantially increasing revenues by entering into new contracts and increasing product sales in the stationary power  electric bus and selected other industrial markets 
however  this increase in revenues will be dependent on our ability to transition our stationary power products from prototypes into commercial grade products 
during  we continued making significant expenditures for our battery initiative  with our existing staff and some new equipment for the manufacture of nano lithium titanate products and increased our sales and marketing efforts 
in  we intend to increase the level of spending on our battery initiatives by continuing the enhancement of our products and their conversion into commercial grade products

revenues power and energy group product sales increased million from million in to million in this was due primarily to the million sale of lto  battery cells and a one megawatt battery system to a chinese company in early power and energy group contracts and grants revenue decreased million from million in to 
million in  as we completed our contract with the us office of naval research in all other contracts and grants revenue decreased by  from million in to  in this decrease resulted primarily from the completion of our us army nanosensor contract in mid all other license fees increased  from zero in to  in  from license revenue associated with technology licensed to alsher titania  llc 
power and energy commercial collaborations decreased  from  in to  in  primarily due to proterra moving from a commercial collaboration contract to a product revenue contract in cost of goods sold cogs product cogs in the power and energy group product cogs increased from of revenue in to of revenue in this increase was due primarily from the sale of product at a reduced price to a chinese company to enable us to secure our initial order from china 
in addition we recorded a  inventory reserve as of december  for battery cell quality issues 
our product gross margins have been  and are expected to be low during as we expand our production volume along with customer demand  and assuming that we shift certain aspects of our manufacturing to china  where we expect to experience lower costs  we expect our production costs to come down  which should result in higher product gross margins 
operating expenses power and energy group research and development expenses decreased million or from million in to million in due to cost reductions in the business 
we performed less research in our battery business as our products mature and focused more on product development from our existing technology 
consolidated sales and marketing costs decreased  or from to as we emphasized cost reduction throughout our business during total general and administrative costs were up  or from to primarily from employee severance costs associated with our departed ceo and cfo and due to the expense related to stock option accelerated vesting for officers and directors resulting from the change in control equity financing in july power and energy group loss on disposal of assets of  in related to the impairment of specified equipment in our reno  nevada corporate headquarters that will no longer be used due to our planned shift of lto manufacturing to china 
other income and expense other income realized gain on warrants increased million from zero in to million in  due to the change in fair value of the warrant liabilities issued during net loss overall net loss decreased million from million in to million in primarily due to a decrease in overall operating expenses of million  a million realized loss on the sale of auction rate securities in  a million realized gain on warrants during  all offset by a reduction of million in gross profit from to fiscal year vs 
revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were million  up from million for power and energy group revenue increased million from million in to million in this was due primarily to million of increased battery module sales to proterra and a million increase in revenue from our office of naval research onr contract  offset by  in non recurring revenues in with bae systems 
the onr contract was completed as of december  all other contracts and grants revenue increased million from  in to million in due to our us army nanosensor contract 
cost of goods sold cogs product cogs in the power and energy group increased from  in to million in primarily from increased battery module sales to proterra 
commercial collaborations cogs in the power and energy group dropped from  in to  in due primarily to the nonrecurring contract with bae systems during contract and grants cogs in the power and energy group increased from million in to million in related primarily to the million increase in revenue from our office of naval research contract 
all other contracts and grants cogs increased from  in to million in due to our us army nanosensor contract 
operating expenses total research and development expenses decreased million or from million in to million in power and energy group research and development expenses decreased million from million in to million in both trends were due to the transfer of more costs to cost of goods sold that directly related to our office of naval research and us army nanosensor contracts 
total sales and marketing expenses increased million or from to as the result of our effort to enhance our sales penetration into our target markets of electricity generation and distribution and electric buses 
total general and administrative costs were down  or from to as the result of our focus on company wide cost controls 
loss on disposal of assets of  during resulted from the early retirement of various production and research and development related assets no longer used in our power and energy group 
other income and expense the million realized loss on investments during resulted primarily from the sale of our auction rate securities million 
net loss overall net loss of million in versus the overall net loss of million during was the result of our transitions in described above 
overall this transition consisted of eliminating our defense and performance materials businesses as we focused on growing our power and energy group business 
critical accounting policies and estimates management based the preceding discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to long lived assets  share based compensation  revenue recognition  overhead allocation  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory  and deferred income tax 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
changes to these judgments and estimates could adversely affect the company s future results of operations and cash flows 
accounts receivable accounts receivable consists of amounts due from customers for services and product sales  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by reviewing each customer account and specifically identifying any potential for loss 
inventory we value our inventories generally at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we employ a full absorption procedure using standard cost techniques 
the standards are customarily reviewed and adjusted every three months 
overhead rates are recorded to inventory based on normal capacity 
any idle facility costs or excessive spoilage are recorded as current period charges 
as of december  we recorded a  inventory valuation allowance due to quality issues with one of our cell suppliers 
as of december   we recorded a  inventory valuation allowance due to quality issues with our cell supplier  of which  was recorded as a receivable from our vendor covered under their product warranty  which was resolved in research and development expenditures the costs of materials  equipment  or facilities that are acquired or constructed for a particular research and development project and that have no alternative future uses in other research and development projects or otherwise are expensed as research and development costs at the time the costs are incurred 
research and development expenditures related to materials and equipment or facilities that are acquired or constructed for research and development activities and that have alternative future uses in research and development projects or otherwise are capitalized when acquired or constructed 
research and development expenditures  which include the cost of materials consumed in research and development activities  salaries  wages and other costs of personnel engaged in research and development  costs of services performed by others for research and development on our behalf and indirect costs are expensed as research and development costs when incurred 
stock based compensation we measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized over the period during which services are provided in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value 
our estimate of the cash flows is based on the information available at the time including the following internal budgets  sales forecasts  customer trends  anticipated production volumes  and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining useful life of the asset which may range from to years for most equipment and up to years for our building and related building improvements 
if an impairment is indicated  the asset value is written down to its fair value 
events or circumstances that could indicate the existence of a possible impairment include obsolescence of the technology  an absence of market demand for the product or the assets used to produce it  a history of operating or cash flow losses and or the partial or complete lapse of technology rights protection 
as of december   we estimate that our future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  are greater than our million investment in long lived assets 
our estimated future cash flows include anticipated product margins and commercial collaborations  since our long lived asset base  which is primarily composed of production  laboratory and testing equipment is utilized to fulfill customer contracts in all revenue categories 
management evaluates the carrying value and useful lives of its long lived assets annually 
in  the long lived assets on hand were evaluated for their future use 
assets with a net book value of  were impaired as of december  in the first quarter of  we reviewed our four capitalized patents and determined that three of these patents had value in excess of their net book value of  at that time 
in the first quarter  we determined that the fourth patent no longer had value 
the fourth patent had an original cost of  accumulated depreciation of  and a net value of  accordingly  an impairment charge of  was recorded  and is reflected for the twelve months ended december  we reviewed the remaining three capitalized patents and show a net weighted average value of  and  at december  and  respectively 
alsher currently has an exclusive license to use this technology from altair 
property  plant and equipment held and used are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is recorded using the straight line method over the following useful lives furniture and office equipment years vehicles years nanoparticle production equipment years building and improvements years patents related to the nanoparticle production technology are carried at cost and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  for a weighted average amortization period of years 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been performed  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
our revenues were derived from product sales  commercial collaborations and contracts and grants 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon delivery of the product  unless specific contractual terms dictate otherwise 
based on the specific terms and conditions of each contract grant  revenues are recognized on a time and materials basis  a percentage of completion basis and or a completed contract basis 
revenue under contracts based on time and materials is recognized at contractually billable rates as labor hours and expenses are incurred 
revenue under contracts based on a fixed fee arrangement is recognized based on various performance measures  such as stipulated milestones 
as these milestones are achieved  revenue is recognized 
from time to time  facts develop that may require us to revise our estimated total costs or revenues expected 
the cumulative effect of revised estimates is recorded in the period in which the facts requiring revisions become known 
the full amount of anticipated losses on any type of contract is recognized in the period in which it becomes known 
payments received in advance relating to the future performance of services or deliveries of products are deferred until the performance of the service is complete or the product is shipped 
upfront payments received in connection with certain rights granted in contractual arrangements are deferred and revenue is recognized over the related time period in which the benefits are received 
accrued warranty we provide a limited warranty for battery packs and energy storage systems 
a liability is recorded for estimated warranty obligations at the date products are sold 
since these are new products  the estimated cost of warranty coverage is based on cell and module life cycle testing and compared for reasonableness to warranty rates on competing battery products 
as sufficient actual historical data is collected on the new product  the estimated cost of warranty coverage will be adjusted accordingly 
the liability for estimated warranty obligations may also be adjusted based on specific warranty issues identified 
net loss per common share basic loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period 
potentially dilutive shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants 
potentially dilutive shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti dilutive 
we had a net loss for all periods presented herein  therefore  none of the stock options and warrants outstanding during each of the periods presented were included in the computation of diluted loss per share as they were anti dilutive 
stock options and warrants to purchase was a total of  shares as of december    shares as of december   and  shares as of december  were excluded from the calculations of diluted loss per share for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid  and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  management considers all potential sources of taxable income  including income available in carryback periods  future reversals of taxable temporary differences  projections of taxable income  and income from tax planning strategies  as well as all available positive and negative evidence 
positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations  projections of future profitability within the carryforward period  including from tax planning strategies  and the company s experience with similar operations 
existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence 
negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses  projections of future losses  or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income 
deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances  resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance 
tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold 
otherwise  these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled  which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized 
fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents and long term debt  when valued using market interest rates  would not be materially different from the amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements
