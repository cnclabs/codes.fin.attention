rjr tobacco rjr tobacco primarily conducts business in the highly competitive us cigarette market  which has a few large manufacturers and many smaller participants 
the us cigarette market is a mature market in which overall consumer demand has declined since and is expected to continue to decline 
profitability of the us cigarette industry and rjr tobacco continues to be adversely impacted by decreases in consumption  increases in state excise taxes and governmental regulations and restrictions  such as marketing limitations  product standards and ingredients legislation

rjr tobacco s cigarette brand portfolio strategy is based upon three brand categories growth  support and non support 
the growth brands consist of a premium brand  camel  and a value brand  pall mall

the support brands include four premium brands  winston  kool  salem and capri  and two value brands  doral and misty  all of which receive limited marketing support 
the non support brands  consisting of all other brands  are managed to maximize near term profitability
