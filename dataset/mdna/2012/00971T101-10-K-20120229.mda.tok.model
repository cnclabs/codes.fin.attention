item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide content delivery and cloud infrastructure services for accelerating and improving the delivery of content and applications over the internet 
we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer  which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or long term contracts 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum 
in recent years  we have also entered into increasing numbers of customer contracts that have minimum usage commitments that are based on quarterly  annual or longer periods 
having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success 
accordingly  to be successful  we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost recurring revenue due to price reductions and customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services and features that our existing customers purchase 
at the same time  we must manage the rate of growth in our expenses as we invest in strategic initiatives that we anticipate will generate future revenue growth 
accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of quality  price and the attractiveness of our services and technology 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or md a  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see risk factors elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers  acquisitions  divestitures  or other events that may be announced after the date hereof 
recent event on february   we announced the resignation of j 
donald sherman as our chief financial officer effective on february  and the appointment of james benson  akamai s senior vice president of finance  as his successor effective as of march  overview of financial results our increase in net income in as compared to and reflected the success of our efforts to increase our recurring revenues while effectively managing the expenses needed to support such growth 
the following sets forth  as a percentage of revenues  consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated revenues cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of other intangible assets restructuring charge total costs and operating expenses income from operations interest income interest expense other income expense  net loss gain on investments  net loss on early extinguishment of debt income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income we were profitable for fiscal years  and  however  we cannot guarantee continued profitability or profitability at the levels we have recently experienced for any period in the future 
we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future 
table of contents revenues and customers in recent years  we have been able to offset lost committed recurring revenues by adding new customers and increasing sales of incremental services to our existing customers 
a continuation of this trend could lead to increased overall revenues  however  any such increased revenues would be offset if we experience lower traffic from non committed revenues or declines in the prices we charge 
if we do not offset lost committed revenues in this manner  our overall revenues will decrease 
our unit prices offered to some customers have declined as a result of increased competition 
these price reductions primarily impacted customers for which we deliver high volumes of traffic over our network  such as digital media customers 
if we continue to experience decreases in unit prices and are unable to offset such reductions with increased traffic  enhanced efficiencies in our network  lower co location and bandwidth expenses  or increased sales of incremental services to existing customers  our revenues and profit margins could decrease 
during  we experienced a moderation in the rate of traffic growth in our video and software download solutions as compared prior periods 
if this trend continues  our ability to generate revenue growth could be adversely impacted 
historically  we have experienced seasonal variations of higher revenues in the fourth quarter of the year and lower revenues during the summer months 
we primarily attribute such variations to patterns of usage of e commerce services by our retail customers 
if this trend continues  our ability to generate quarterly revenue growth on a sequential basis could be impacted 
during  revenues derived from customers outside the united states accounted for of our total revenues 
for  we anticipate revenues from such customers as a percentage of our total revenues to be consistent with costs and expenses during  we continued to reduce our network bandwidth costs per unit and to invest in internal use software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network 
our total bandwidth costs increased in as compared to due to traffic growth on our network 
we believe that our overall bandwidth costs will continue to increase as a result of expected higher traffic levels  partially offset by anticipated continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit 
if we do not experience lower per unit bandwidth pricing or we are unsuccessful at effectively routing traffic over our network through lower cost providers  total network bandwidth costs could increase more than expected in in  co location costs increased and became a higher percentage of total cost of revenues due to continued expansion of our network 
by improving our internal use software to enable us to use servers more efficiently  we believe we can manage the growth of co location costs by deploying fewer servers 
if we are unable to achieve such cost reductions  our profitability will be negatively impacted 
depreciation and amortization expense related to our network equipment and internal use software development costs increased by million during as compared to due to expected future purchases of network equipment during  we believe that depreciation expense related to our network equipment will continue to increase in we expect to continue to enhance and add functionality to our service offerings  which would increase capitalized stock based compensation expense attributable to employees working on such projects 
as a result  we believe that the amortization of internal use software development costs  which we include in cost of revenues  will be higher in as compared to all of these increased costs could negatively affect our profitability 
we expect to continue to grant restricted stock units  or rsus  to employees in the future  therefore  we anticipate that stock based compensation expense will increase 
as of december   our total unrecognized compensation costs for stock based awards were million  which we expect to recognize as expense over a weighted average period of years 
this expense is expected to be recognized through for fiscal  our effective income tax rate was 
we expect our annual effective income tax rate in to increase due to the expiration of the federal research and development credit at the end of  as well as the change in mix of income in various jurisdictions  this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of our compliance with the accounting guidance for stock based compensation  any tax planning strategies or the effect of changes in tax laws and regulations 
based on our analysis of  among other things  the aforementioned trends and events  as of the date of this annual report on form k  we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly and annual basis during  however  our future results are likely to be affected by many factors identified in the section captioned risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including our ability to 
table of contents increase our revenue by adding customers through recurring revenue contracts and limiting customer cancellations and terminations  offset unit price declines for our services with higher volumes of traffic delivered on our network as well as increased sales of our value added solutions  prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents or intentional attacks  and maintain our network bandwidth costs and other operating expenses consistent with our revenues 
as a result  there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives  including generating positive net income  in any future period 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates overview our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and related reserves  valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities  capitalized internal use software costs  goodwill and other intangible assets  tax reserves  impairment and useful lives of long lived assets  loss contingencies and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
definitions we define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles 
our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 
review of critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize service revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition  including guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we primarily derive revenues from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly  quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly  quarterly or annual minimum 
for these services  we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month  provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the service has been delivered to the customer  the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
should a customer s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum  we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage 
for annual or other non monthly period revenue commitments  we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 
we typically charge customers an integration fee when the services are first activated 
the integration fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement 
we also derive revenue from services sold as discrete  non recurring events or based solely on usage 
for these services  we recognize revenue once the event or usage has occurred 
when more than one element is contained in a revenue arrangement  we determine the fair value for each element in the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  for each respective element  including any renewal rates for services contractually offered to the customer 
for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe  third party evidence  or tpe  of the fair value of each element is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately by another vendor 
for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe or tpe for each element  we use the best estimate of selling price  or besp  to determine the fair value of the separate deliverables 
we allocate arrangement consideration across the multiple elements using the relative selling price method 

table of contents at the inception of a customer contract for service  we make an estimate as to that customer s ability to pay for the services provided 
we base our estimate on a combination of factors  including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review  our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance 
upon the completion of these steps  we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received from the customer 
changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 
we also sell our services through a reseller channel 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller s contracted non refundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract  plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments 
amounts attributable to this excess usage are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 
from time to time  we enter into contracts to sell our services to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies 
if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently  we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor  unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor s product or service can be objectively established 
we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties 
we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service  such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service 
if these conditions are present  we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees  prepayments made by customers for future periods  deferred integration and activation set up fees and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms 
accounts receivable and related reserves trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest 
in addition to trade accounts receivable  our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month 
we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance 
these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cash basis 
increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses 
increases in the reserve for cash basis customers are recorded as reduction of revenue 
the reserve for cash basis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer reasonably assured 
the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 
estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer specific  account by account basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers 
if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided  any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 
valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities that have been classified as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in accessible active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves 
fair values determined by level inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability 
investments and marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other than temporary 
we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other than temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including  among other factors  the duration of the period that  and extent to which  the fair value is less than cost basis  the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors  overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  a write down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established 
assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty 
write downs  if recorded  could be materially different 
table of contents from the actual market performance of investments and marketable securities in our portfolio if  among other things  relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 
impairment and useful lives of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets and intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset 
when such events occur  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset 
if this comparison indicates that impairment is present  the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
if a readily determinable market price does not exist  fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset 
the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long lived assets  the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
as of december  and  we concluded that we had one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of december  and we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of each of such dates  and the tests did not indicate an impairment of goodwill 
other intangible assets consist of completed technologies  customer relationships  trademarks and non compete agreements arising from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights 
purchased intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets 
goodwill is carried at its historical cost 
loss contingencies we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation 
we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote  we do not record a liability  but we disclose the nature of these loss contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
tax reserves our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion 
the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 
we currently have net deferred tax assets  comprised of net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions 
these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions 
our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated 
uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our financial statements under guidance that prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
as of december   we had unrecognized tax benefits of million  including accrued interest and penalties 
accounting for stock based compensation we issue stock based compensation awards including stock options  rsus and deferred stock units 
we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards 
determining the fair value of stock based awards 
table of contents at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock 
our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods 
changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock based awards  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock options that are expected to be forfeited 
should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates  our stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted 
in addition  for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions  we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved 
changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stock based compensation expense recorded and could materially impact our result of operations 
for stock options  rsus and deferred stock units that contain only a service based vesting feature  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the awards vesting period 
for awards with a performance condition based vesting feature  we recognize compensation cost on a graded vesting basis over the awards expected vesting period  commencing when achievement of the performance condition is deemed probable 
capitalized internal use software costs we capitalize the salaries and payroll related costs  as well as stock based compensation expense  of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal use software projects 
if a project constitutes an enhancement to previously developed software  we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software  thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization 
once the project is complete  we estimate the useful life of the internal use software  and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired 
changes in our estimates related to internal use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 
results of operations revenues 
total revenues increased  or million  to  million for the year ended december  as compared to  million for the year ended december  total revenues increased  or million  to  million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the following table quantifies the increase in revenues attributable to the different industry verticals in which we sell our services in millions for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  as compared to media entertainment commerce enterprise high tech public sector total net increase we believe that the continued growth in use of the internet by businesses and consumers was the principal factor driving increased purchases of our services during each of the last several years 
we expect this trend to continue in but at lower rates of growth due to general economic conditions and competitive factors 
the increase in revenues for as compared to  as well as as compared to  was driven by increased revenues from our media and entertainment vertical due to traffic growth  partially offset by reduced prices charged to our customers 
revenues from our commerce and enterprise verticals increased due to growth in application and cloud performance solutions sold to customers in these verticals 
revenues from our high tech vertical in as compared to remained relatively flat as increased demand for application and cloud performance solutions offset the decline in software download revenues 
the increase in revenues from our high tech vertical in as compared to  was due to an increase in traffic growth as well as an increase in demand for our application and cloud performance solution services 
our revenues from the public sector vertical did not materially change as compared to the increase in revenues from public sector customers as compared to was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers and government contracts 
for  and   and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from our operations located outside of the united states 
revenue from our operations in europe represented  and of total revenues for  
table of contents and  respectively 
other than the united states  no single country accounted for or more of our total revenues during these periods 
we expect international sales as a percentage of our total sales in to remain consistent as compared to resellers accounted for of total revenues in  in and in for  and  no single customer accounted for or more of total revenues 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and co location of our network equipment 
cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and stock based compensation expense for network operations personnel  cost of software licenses  depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internal use software 
cost of revenues was comprised of the following in millions for the years ended december  bandwidth and service related fees co location fees payroll and related costs of network operations personnel stock based compensation  including amortization of prior capitalized amounts depreciation and impairment of network equipment amortization of internal use software total cost of revenues cost of revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  cost of revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  in each instance  these increases were primarily due to an increase in the amounts paid to network providers due to higher traffic levels  partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit  an increase in co location costs as we deployed more servers  and increases in depreciation expense of network equipment and amortization of internal use software as we continued to invest in our infrastructure 
additionally  in each of  and  cost of revenues included stock based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock based compensation  such expense decreased by million in as compared to and increased by million in as compared to cost of revenues during each of  and also included credits received of approximately million  million and million  respectively  from settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts 
credits of this nature may occur in the future  however  the timing and amount of future credits  if any  are unpredictable 
we have long term purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and co location with various networks and internet service providers 
as of december   our current minimum commitments for the years ending december    and were approximately million  million  million and million  respectively 
we believe cost of revenues will increase in as compared to we expect to deploy more servers and to deliver more traffic on our network  which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic and co location fees  however  such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit 
additionally  for  we anticipate increases in depreciation expense related to our network equipment and amortization of internal use software development costs  along with increased payroll and related costs  as we continue to make investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and stock based compensation expense for research and development personnel who design  develop  test  deploy and enhance our services and our network 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  except for certain internal use software development costs eligible for capitalization 
during the years ended december   and  we capitalized software development costs of million  million and million  respectively  net of impairments 
these development costs consisted of external consulting  payroll and payroll related costs for personnel involved in the development of internal use software used to deliver our services and operate our network 
additionally  for the years ended december   and  we capitalized as internal use software million  million and million  respectively  of non cash stock based compensation  net of impairments 
we amortize these capitalized internal use software costs to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years 

table of contents research and development expenses decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in research and development expenses in as compared to was due to higher capitalized salaries and a decrease in stock based compensation  partially offset by increases in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth 
the increase in research and development expenses in as compared to was due to increases in payroll and related costs and stock based compensation  partially offset by higher capitalized salaries 
the following table quantifies the net changes in the various components of our research and development expenses for the periods presented in millions increase decrease in research and development expenses to to payroll and related costs stock based compensation capitalized salaries and other total net decrease increase we believe that research and development expenses will increase in as compared to because we expect to continue to hire additional development personnel in order to make improvements in our core technology  develop new services and make refinements to our other service offerings 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs  stock based compensation expense and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and support functions  as well as advertising and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses during as compared to was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs  particularly commissions for sales and sales support personnel  attributable to revenue growth  largely offset by a decrease in stock based compensation  marketing and related costs and other expenses 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses during as compared to was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs  particularly higher commissions for sales and sales support personnel  an increase in stock based compensation  marketing and related costs and an increase in other expenses  such as travel costs  which was partially offset by a reduction in training and conference costs 
the following table quantifies the net increase in the various components of our sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented in millions increase decrease in sales and marketing expenses to to payroll and related costs stock based compensation marketing and related costs other expense total net increase we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in due to an expected increase in commissions on higher forecasted sales of our services and an increase in payroll and related costs due to continued growth in the number of our sales and marketing personnel 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the following components payroll  stock based compensation expense and other related costs  including expenses for executive  finance  business applications  network management  human resources and other administrative personnel  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment we use internally  
table of contents fees for professional services  rent and other facility related expenditures for leased properties  the provision for doubtful accounts  insurance costs  and non income related taxes 
general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses during as compared to  was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth  an increase in facilities related costs and other expenses such as acquisition related costs  an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts  and an increase in legal fees 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation and non income tax expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses during as compared to was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth and increases in stock based compensation  facilities related costs and other expenses such as non capitializable equipment purchases and maintenance 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in the provision for doubtful accounts during as compared to the following table quantifies the net increase in various components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods presented in millions increase decrease in general and administrative expenses to to payroll and related costs stock based compensation non income taxes facilities related costs depreciation and amortization provision for doubtful accounts legal fees consulting and advisory services other expenses total net increase we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in as compared to due to increased payroll and related costs attributable to increased hiring 
amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and amortization of acquired license rights 
amortization of other intangible assets increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  amortization of other intangible assets remained consistent at million for each of the years ended december  and the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in as compared to was due to the acquisition of velocitude in june as of december   we anticipate that amortization expense will be approximately million  million  million  million and million for the years ending december     and  respectively 
restructuring charge 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million for the year ended december  primarily in connection with a workforce reduction we implemented in december this charge included million of employee severance benefits and million of restructuring charges attributable to vacated facility leases 
during the year ended december   we recorded a restructuring charge of million in connection with employee severance benefits 
we did not have any restructuring charges in we expect that our restructuring liabilities associated with employee severance benefits will be fully paid in restructuring liabilities associated with facility leases will be fully paid through december interest income 
interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities 
interest income 
table of contents decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  interest income decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decreases in as compared to and in as compared to were primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments during the comparable periods 
interest expense 
interest expense includes interest that was paid on our former debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs 
during the year ended december   we had no outstanding interest bearing indebtedness requiring the payment of interest and therefore had no interest expense 
interest expense decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense during these periods was primarily attributable to interest payable on the outstanding amount of our convertible senior notes 
the decrease in interest expense in resulted from the conversion into common stock of an aggregate of million in principal amount of our convertible notes during that year 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses incurred  gains and losses from legal settlements  and other non operating income expense items 
other income expense  net increased million to million of income for the year ended december  as compared to million of expense for the year ended december  other income expense  net decreased million to million of expense for the year ended december  as compared to million of income for the year ended december  other income expense  net for the year ended december  consisted of foreign exchange losses and net funds received and paid as part of litigation settlements 
other income expense  net for the year ended december  consisted of foreign exchange losses 
other income  net for the year ended december  consisted of million of gains on legal settlements and million of gains on divesture of certain assets  offset by million of foreign exchange losses 
other income expense  net may fluctuate in the future based upon movements in foreign exchange rates  the outcome of legal proceedings and other events 
loss gain on investments  net 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net loss on investments of million primarily related to the sale of marketable securities and a write off of an equity investment 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net gain on investments of million primarily related to the sale of marketable securities 
additionally  during we recorded a gain of million due to a decrease in the other than temporary impairment of certain auction rate securities  or ars  offset by a loss of million on a put option related to our ars holdings 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net gain on investments of million  which primarily related to an unrealized gain of million from a decrease in the other than temporary impairment of certain marketable securities offset by an unrealized loss of million on a put option related to our ars holdings 
provision for income taxes

for the year ended december   our effective tax rate of was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to state income taxes and the effect of non deductible stock based compensation  partially offset by the benefit recorded for research and development tax credits 
provision for income taxes increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  provision for income taxes remained consistent at million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase from to was primarily due to an increase in operating income 
the slight decrease from to was due to a decrease in the effective tax rate  offset by an increase in operating income 
we expect our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in to increase due to the expiration of the federal research and development credit at the end of  as well as the change in mix of income in various jurisdictions  this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of stock based compensation or any potential tax planning strategies 
our effective tax rate could be materially different depending on the nature and timing of the disposition of incentive and other employee stock options 
further  our effective tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events  including settlements of tax audits and assessments  the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 
in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  annualized effective tax rates  and cash paid for income taxes  management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies 
judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain  therefore  actual results could differ materially from our projections 
we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions 
these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations by different 
table of contents taxing jurisdictions 
our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount that we have estimated 
non gaap measures in addition to the traditional financial measurements reflected in our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap  we also compile and monitor certain non gaap financial measures related to the performance of our business 
we typically discuss the non gaap financial measures described below on our quarterly public earnings release calls 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s historical or future financial performance that excludes amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in the gaap statement of operations 
we believe that making available the non gaap financial measures described below helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our past performance and future prospects  especially when comparing such results to previous periods  forecasts or competitors financial information 
our management uses these non gaap measures  in addition to gaap financial measures  as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors 
these measures are also used by management in its financial and operational decision making 
we consider normalized net income and normalized net income per diluted common share to be important indicators of our overall performance as they eliminate the effects of events that are either not part of our core operations or are non cash items 
we define normalized net income as net income determined in accordance with gaap excluding the following pre tax items amortization of other acquired intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  stock based compensation reflected as a component of amortization of capitalized internal use software  restructuring charges and benefits  acquisition related costs and benefits  certain gains and losses on investments  loss on early extinguishment of debt and gains and losses on legal settlements 
these non gaap financial measures should be used in addition to  and in conjunction with  results presented in accordance with gaap

adjusted ebitda eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income determined in accordance with gaap excluding interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  stock based compensation reflected as a component of amortization of capitalized internal use software  restructuring charges and benefits  acquisition related costs and benefits  certain gains and losses on investments  foreign exchange gains and losses  loss on early extinguishment of debt and gains or losses on legal settlements

liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities  proceeds from exercises of stock awards and cash generated by operations 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which consisted of corporate debt securities  united states treasury and government agency securities  commercial paper  corporate debt securities and money market funds  totaled  million  the majority of which is located in the united states

net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the change in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in net income and depreciation and amortization expense and a decrease in our excess tax benefits from stock based compensation  offset by a decrease in our provision for deferred income taxes

table of contents deferred income taxes 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities will increase as a result of an expected increase in cash collections related to higher revenues  partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries and higher commissions 
current economic conditions could negatively impact our cash provided by operating activities if we are unable to manage our days sales outstanding or our business otherwise deteriorates

changes in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in  among other things  working capital items such as deferred revenue  accounts payable  accounts receivable and various accrued expenses  as well as changes in our capital and financial structure  including debt and equity repurchases and issuances  stock option exercises  sales of equity investments and similar events 
the following table represents the net inflows and outflows of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented in millions

we do not expect to recognize any of these tax benefits in we are not  however  able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations 
letters of credit as of december   we had outstanding million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries  primarily related to facility leases 
these irrevocable letters of credit are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect until december off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties  including vendors  customers  landlords  our officers and directors  shareholders of acquired companies and third party licensees of our technology 
generally  these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events  such as lawsuits arising 
table of contents from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence 
these indemnification obligations are considered off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
to date  we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any significant liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 
litigation we are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business 
management does not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
see legal proceedings elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further discussion on litigation 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued an accounting standard update for business combinations specifically related to the disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
this guidance specifies that pro forma disclosures should be reported as if the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period  and the pro forma disclosures must include a description of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments 
this standard was effective for business combinations with an acquisition date of january  or later 
the adoption of the guidance did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued amended guidance and disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
this guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements  particularly for level fair value measurements 
this standard will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and will be applied prospectively 
the adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued amended disclosure requirements for the presentation of comprehensive income 
the amended guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income  or oci  as part of the statement of changes in equity 
under the amended guidance  all changes in oci are to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
the changes will be effective january  and early adoption is permitted 
there will be no impact on our consolidated financial results as the amendments relate only to changes in financial statement presentation 
in september  the fasb issued amended guidance that will simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
under the amended guidance  after assessment of certain qualitative factors  if it is determined to be more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  entities must perform the quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the quantitative test s are optional 
the guidance is effective january  with early adoption permitted 
we intend to adopt this guidance effective january  the adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our portfolio of cash equivalents and short and long term investments is maintained in a variety of securities  including government agency obligations  high quality corporate bonds and money market funds 
investments are classified as available for sale securities and carried at their fair market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair market value of certain securities in our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk growth in our international operations will incrementally increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues and operating expenses 
conversely  our net revenues and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
transaction exposure the company enters into short term foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re measurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in non functional currencies 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives  as well as re measurement gains and losses  are recognized in other expense  net 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were determined to be immaterial during the year ended december  translation exposure foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet 
these gains or losses are recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity which is reflected in our balance sheet under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
credit risk concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited to certain customers to which we make substantial sales 
our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across numerous industries 
to reduce risk  we routinely assess the financial strength of our customers 
based on such assessments  we believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited 
as of december  and december   one customer had an account receivable balance greater than of our accounts receivable 
we believe that  at december   concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable was not significant
