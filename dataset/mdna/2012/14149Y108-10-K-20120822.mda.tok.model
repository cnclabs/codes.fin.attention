table of contents part i item business general cardinal health  inc is an ohio corporation formed in as used in this report  we  our  us and similar pronouns refer to cardinal health  inc and its subsidiaries  unless the context requires otherwise 
we are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies  hospitals  surgery centers  physician offices and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs  enhancing efficiency and improving quality 
our fiscal year ends on june references to fiscal  and are to the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
except as otherwise specified  information in this form k is provided as of june  pharmaceutical segment in the united states  including puerto rico  the pharmaceutical segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical  over the counter healthcare  and consumer products through its pharmaceutical distribution business to retailers including chain and independent drug stores and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers  hospitals  and other healthcare providers including mail order pharmacies 
this business maintains prime vendor relationships that streamline the purchasing process resulting in greater efficiency and lower costs for our customers  and renders services to pharmaceutical manufacturers including distribution  inventory management  data reporting  new product launch support  and contract pricing and chargeback administration 
operates nuclear pharmacies and cyclotron facilities that manufacture  prepare and deliver radiopharmaceuticals for use in nuclear imaging and other procedures in hospitals and clinics  distributes specialty pharmaceutical products and provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers  third party payors and healthcare service providers supporting the marketing  distribution  and payment for specialty pharmaceutical products  franchises retail pharmacies under the medicine shoppe and medicap brands  and provides pharmacy services to hospitals and other healthcare facilities 
in china  the pharmaceutical segment distributes branded  generic and specialty pharmaceuticals  over the counter and consumer products as well as provides logistics  marketing and other services through cardinal health china 
pharmaceutical distribution our pharmaceutical distribution business generates gross margin primarily when the aggregate selling price to our customers exceeds the aggregate cost of products sold  net of cash discounts  generic manufacturer margin and margin under branded pharmaceutical agreements 
cash discounts are price reductions that manufacturers may offer to us for prompt payment of purchased products 
generic manufacturer margin refers to price discounts  rebates and other consideration that we receive under our agreements with manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals 
our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally highest during that period and tend to decline over time  although this may vary 
margin under branded pharmaceutical agreements refers primarily to fees we receive for rendering a range of distribution and related services to manufacturers 
in addition  margin under branded pharmaceutical agreements may include benefits from pharmaceutical price appreciation  which occurs when a manufacturer increases its published price for a product after we have purchased that product for inventory 
bulk and non bulk sales the pharmaceutical segment differentiates between bulk and non bulk sales based on the nature of our customers operations 
bulk sales consist of sales to retail chain customers centralized warehouse operations and customers mail order businesses in the united states 
all other sales are classified as non bulk 
sales to a retail chain pharmacy customer are classified as bulk sales with respect to its warehouse operations and non bulk sales with respect to its retail stores 
substantially all bulk sales consist of products shipped in the same form that we receive them from the manufacturer  a small portion of bulk sales are broken down into smaller units prior to shipping 
in contrast  non bulk sales require more complex servicing 
for non bulk sales  we may receive inventory in large or full case quantities and break it down into smaller quantities  warehouse the product for a longer period of time  pick individual products specific to a customer s order  and deliver that smaller order to a customer location 
bulk sales generate significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than non bulk sales 
customers receive lower pricing on bulk sales of the same products than non bulk sales  as bulk sales require less services to be provided to these customers  and hence  less costs are incurred by us in providing these products 
in addition  bulk sales in aggregate generate higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than non bulk sales  due to the mix of products sold within the bulk category 
segment distribution  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk sales are substantially lower than from non bulk sales because bulk sales require substantially fewer services to be rendered by us than non bulk sales 

table of contents the following table shows the revenues  segment expenses  segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and non bulk sales for fiscal  and in millions non bulk sales revenue from non bulk sales segment expenses allocated to non bulk sales segment profit from non bulk sales segment profit from non bulk sales as a percentage of revenue from non bulk sales bulk sales revenue from bulk sales segment expenses allocated to bulk sales segment profit from bulk sales segment profit from bulk sales as a percentage of revenue from bulk sales segment expenses and profit required complex and subjective estimates and allocations based upon assumptions  past experience and judgment that we believe are reasonable 
specialty pharmaceutical products and services we refer to products and services offered by our specialty solutions division as specialty pharmaceutical products and services 
the specialty solutions division currently distributes oncology  rheumatology and other pharmaceutical products to physician offices  distributes human plasma products and some limited distribution pharmaceutical products to hospitals and other healthcare providers  and provides various consulting and other services to pharmaceutical manufacturers  third party payors and healthcare providers primarily supporting the marketing  distribution and payment for these products 
our use of this terminology may not be comparable to the use by other industry participants

our two largest gpo relationships in terms of member revenue are with novation  llc  and premier purchasing partners  lp sales to members of these two gpos collectively accounted for percent of our revenue in fiscal suppliers we rely on many different suppliers 
products obtained from our five largest suppliers accounted for an aggregate of approximately percent of our revenue during fiscal  but no single supplier s products accounted for more than percent of that revenue 
overall  we believe our relationships with our suppliers are good 
the pharmaceutical distribution business is a party to distribution service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
these agreements generally have terms ranging from one year  with an automatic renewal feature  to five years 
generally  these agreements are terminable before they expire only if the parties mutually agree  if there is an uncured breach of the agreement  or if one party is the subject of a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event 
some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate the agreement without cause within a defined notice period 
competition we operate in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services 
we also operate in a highly competitive environment in the development  manufacturing and distribution of medical and surgical products 
we compete on many levels  including service offerings  support services  breadth of product lines  and price 
in the pharmaceutical segment  we compete with national  full line wholesale distributors including mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation  regional wholesale distributors including hd smith and morris dickson co  hd  self warehousing chains  direct selling manufacturers  specialty distributors  third party logistics companies including united parcel service  inc  and nuclear pharmacies  among others

employees as of june   we had approximately  employees in the united states and approximately  employees outside of the united states 
overall  we consider our employee relations to be good 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of trade secret  patent  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual provisions  and technical measures to protect our products  services and intangible assets 
we hold patents relating to the distribution of our nuclear pharmacy products and service offerings  and relating to medical and surgical products  such as fluid suction and irrigation devices  surgical waste management systems  surgical and medical examination gloves  surgical drapes  gowns and facial protection products  and patient temperature management products 
we also operate under licenses for certain proprietary technologies  and in certain instances we license our technologies to third parties 
we believe that we have taken all necessary steps to protect our proprietary rights  but no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights in the event that they are subject to third party infringement claims 
while all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations  we do not consider any particular patent  trademark  license  franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 

table of contents regulatory matters our business is highly regulated in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries 
depending upon their specific business  our subsidiaries may be subject to regulation by government entities including the united states food and drug administration the fda  the united states drug enforcement administration the dea  the united states nuclear regulatory commission the nrc  the united states department of health and human services hhs  united states customs and border protection  state boards of pharmacy  state controlled substance agencies  state health departments  insurance departments or other comparable state agencies  and foreign agencies that are comparable to those listed above 
these regulatory agencies have a variety of civil  administrative and criminal sanctions at their disposal 
they can suspend our ability to distribute products or can initiate product recalls  they can seize products or impose criminal  civil and administrative sanctions  and they can seek injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products 
distribution the fda  dea and various state authorities regulate the marketing  purchase  storage and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products under various state and federal statutes including the prescription drug marketing act of and the federal controlled substances act the csa 
wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea registrations and state level licenses  meet various security and operating standards  and comply with the csa which governs the sale  packaging  storage and distribution of controlled substances 
as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  on may   we entered into a settlement agreement with the dea pursuant to which our lakeland  florida pharmaceutical distribution center s registration to distribute controlled substances will be suspended until may  during this suspension  our lakeland facility will continue to distribute pharmaceutical products other than controlled substances while controlled substances will be shipped to customers from our other distribution centers 
our pharmaceutical segment s china distribution operations are subject to similar national  regional and local regulations  including licensing and regulatory requirements of the china ministry of health  ministry of commerce  ministry of finance  the state food and drug administration and the general administration of customs 
manufacturing and marketing our subsidiaries that manufacture and source medical devices are subject to regulation by the fda and comparable foreign agencies including regulations regarding compliance with good manufacturing practices and quality systems 
the fda and other domestic and foreign governmental agencies administer requirements that cover the design  testing  safety  effectiveness  manufacturing  labeling  promotion and advertising  distribution  importation and post market surveillance of some of our manufactured products 
we need specific approval or clearance from regulatory authorities before we can market and sell many of our products in particular countries 
even after we obtain approval or clearance to market a product  the product and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued regulatory review 
to assess and facilitate compliance with federal  state and foreign regulatory requirements  we routinely review our quality and compliance systems to evaluate their effectiveness and to identify areas for improvement or remediation 
as part of our quality review  we assess the suppliers of raw materials  components and finished goods that are incorporated into the medical devices we manufacture 
in addition  we conduct quality management reviews designed to highlight key issues that may affect the quality of our products and services 
from time to time  we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications  regulatory requirements  or published standards 
when we or a regulatory agency identify a quality or regulatory issue  we investigate and take appropriate corrective action  such as withdrawing the product from the market  correcting the product at the customer location  revising product labeling  and notifying customers 
for example  in august  the fda notified us that it was halting entry into the united states of all presource procedure kits that we assemble in mexico and import through el paso  texas 
the fda indicated that we had not supplied adequate documentary support for certain components of these procedure kits  but did not indicate any concerns about patient safety 
in response to the fda s concerns we took remedial actions and have resumed importing procedure kits 
nuclear pharmacies and related businesses our nuclear pharmacies and cyclotron facilities require licenses or permits and must abide by regulations from the nrc  applicable state boards of pharmacy  and the radiologic health agency or department of health of each state in which we operate 
in addition  our cyclotron facilities must comply with the fda s good manufacturing practices regulations for positron emission tomography pet drugs that became effective in december prescription drug pedigree tracking and supply chain integrity the fda amendments act of requires the fda to establish standards to identify and validate technologies for securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs 
these standards may include track and trace or authentication technologies  such as radio frequency identification devices 
in march  the fda issued guidance establishing standardized numerical identifiers for prescription pharmaceutical packages 
some states also have adopted or are considering adopting pedigree tracking laws 
for example  effective july  california will require that pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers implement electronic track and trace capabilities for pharmaceutical products 

table of contents healthcare fraud and abuse laws we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws 
these laws generally prohibit companies from soliciting  offering  receiving or paying any compensation in order to induce someone to order or purchase items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare  medicaid or other united states government sponsored healthcare programs 
they also prohibit submitting or causing to be submitted any fraudulent claim for payment by the federal government 
violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties  as well as claims under the federal false claims act and similar state acts under which private persons may file suit on behalf of the federal and state governments 
health and personal information practices services and products provided by some of our businesses  including some provided by our nuclear and pharmacy services and specialty solutions divisions  involve access to patient identifiable healthcare information 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  as augmented by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act  as well as some state laws  regulate the use and disclosure of patient identifiable health information  including requiring specified privacy and security measures 
federal and state officials have increasingly focused on how patient identifiable healthcare information should be handled  secured and disclosed 
some of our businesses collect and maintain other sensitive personal information that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information 
security and disclosure of personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate 
environmental  health and safety laws in the united states and other countries  we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws  as well as laws relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices 
laws relating to foreign trade and operations united states and international laws require us to abide by standards relating to the import and export of finished goods  raw materials and supplies and the handling of information 
we also must comply with various export control and trade embargo laws  which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within some countries or with some counterparties 
similarly  we are subject to laws concerning the conduct of our foreign operations  including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and foreign anti bribery laws 
these laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering  promising or making payments to officials of foreign governments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
other information although our agreements with manufacturers sometimes require us to maintain inventory levels within specified ranges  our distribution businesses are generally not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements 
certain supply contracts with united states government entities require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands  but we do not believe those requirements materially affect inventory levels 
our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned  subject to restocking fees 
we only allow customers to return products that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value  or that can be returned to vendors for credit 
we offer market payment terms to our customers

item a risk factors the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and cash flows 
these are not the only risks we face 
our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations 
we could suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 
as described in greater detail in item business above  we operate in markets that are highly competitive 
because of competition  our businesses face continued pricing pressure from our customers and suppliers 
if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as effective sourcing and enhanced cost control measures  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  in recent years  the healthcare industry has continued to consolidate 
further consolidation among our customers and suppliers including branded pharmaceutical manufacturers could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power  which may adversely impact our results of operations 
we have a few large customers that generate a significant amount of our revenue 
our sales and credit concentration is significant 
cvs and walgreens accounted for approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our fiscal revenue 
the aggregate of our five largest customers  including cvs and walgreens  accounted for approximately percent of our fiscal revenue 
in addition  walgreens and cvs accounted for percent and percent  
table of contents respectively  of our gross trade receivable balance at june  our contracts with cvs and walgreens are scheduled to expire in june and august  respectively 
if cvs  walgreens or one of our other large customers terminates or does not renew its contract  defaults in payment  or significantly reduces its purchases of our products  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
for example  in july  express scripts  inc informed us that it had not awarded us the combined pharmaceutical distribution contract following its merger with medco health solutions  inc our contract with express scripts  inc 
expires on september  and provided approximately billion of revenue in fiscal  all of which was classified as bulk sales 
the expiration of that contract will have an adverse effect on our results of operations and operating cash flow 
our pharmaceutical segment s margin may be affected by fewer or less profitable generic pharmaceutical launches  prices established by manufacturers and other factors that are beyond our control 
as described in greater detail in item business above  margin in our pharmaceutical segment consists  in part  of generic manufacturer margin and margin from branded pharmaceutical price appreciation 
the number of new generic pharmaceutical launches varies from year to year  and the margin impact of new launches varies from product to product 
fewer generic pharmaceutical launches or launches that are less profitable than those previously experienced will have an adverse effect on our year over year margins 
additionally  prices for existing generic pharmaceuticals generally decline over time  although this may vary 
price deflation on existing generic pharmaceuticals will have an adverse effect on our margins 
with respect to branded pharmaceutical price appreciation  if branded manufacturers increase prices less frequently or by amounts smaller than have been experienced historically  we will earn less margin on branded pharmaceuticals 
the united states healthcare environment is changing in many ways  some of which may not be favorable to us  including changes resulting from federal healthcare legislation 
the healthcare industry continues to undergo significant changes designed to increase access to medical care  improve safety and contain costs 
medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels have declined  the use of managed care has increased  distributors  manufacturers  healthcare providers and pharmacy chains have consolidated  and large purchasing groups are prevalent 
in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the healthcare reform acts were enacted 
among other things  the healthcare reform acts seek to expand health insurance coverage to over million uninsured americans 
many of the significant changes in the healthcare reform acts do not take effect until  including a requirement that most americans carry health insurance 
we expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services  but other provisions of the healthcare reform acts could affect us adversely 
the healthcare reform acts contain many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions  including  as discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below  a tax to be paid by medical device manufacturers 
in addition  the healthcare reform acts have provisions designed to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid  including changing the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement to no less than percent of the average weighted manufacturer s price amp from percent of the lowest amp for generic pharmaceuticals 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services is also considering providing states with alternatives to traditional reimbursement metrics 
we could be adversely affected directly or indirectly if our customers are adversely affected by these and other changes in the delivery or pricing of  or reimbursement for  pharmaceuticals  medical devices or healthcare services 
our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated 
as described in greater detail in item business above  we are subject to regulation in the united states at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries 
in addition  the united states federal and state governments are devoting greater resources to the enforcement of these laws 
if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements  or if allegations are made that we fail to comply  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
to lawfully operate our businesses  we are required to hold permits  licenses and other regulatory approvals from  and to comply with operating and security standards of  governmental bodies 
failure to maintain or renew necessary permits  licenses or approvals  or to comply with required standards  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for example  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of regulatory matters relating to our distribution of controlled substances 
products that we manufacture  source  distribute or market are required to comply with regulatory requirements 
noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance may result in suspension of our ability to distribute  import or manufacture products  product recalls or seizures  or criminal and civil sanctions 
we are required to comply with laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse 
if we fail to comply with them  we could be subject to federal or state government investigations  or false claims act proceedings initiated by private parties  which could result in civil and criminal sanctions  including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 
the requirements of these laws are complicated and subject to interpretation and may be applied by a regulator  prosecutor or judge in a manner that could negatively impact us or require us to change our operations 

table of contents our global operations are required to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions and with united states and foreign export control  trade embargo and customs laws 
if we fail to comply with them  we could suffer civil and criminal sanctions 
we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions 
we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries 
as a result  we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions 
from time to time  legislative initiatives are proposed  such as the repeal of last in  first out lifo treatment of inventory or the current us taxation of income earned by foreign subsidiaries  that could adversely affect our tax positions  effective tax rate  tax payments or financial condition 
tax laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations 
tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others 
these challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate  tax payments or financial condition 
carefusion may not satisfy its contractual obligations 
in august  we entered into a tax matters agreement pursuant to which carefusion is obligated to indemnify us for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes prior to the spin off 
the indemnification receivable was million at june  the failure of carefusion to perform its obligations under this agreement could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the spin off may have unexpected tax consequences 
in connection with the spin off  we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs to the effect that the contribution by us of the assets of the clinical and medical products businesses to carefusion and the distribution of carefusion shares to our shareholders would qualify as a tax free transaction under sections and a d of the internal revenue code the code 
in addition  we received opinions of tax counsel to the effect that the spin off would qualify as a transaction that is described in sections a and a d of the code 
the irs private letter ruling and the opinions of counsel rely on certain facts  assumptions  representations and undertakings from us and carefusion regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters 
if any of these facts  assumptions  representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied  we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs ruling or the opinions of tax counsel 
similarly  the irs could determine on audit that the spin off is taxable if it determines that any of the facts  assumptions  representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if the irs disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions of counsel that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons 
if the spin off is determined to be taxable for united states federal income tax purposes  we and our shareholders that are subject to united states federal income tax could incur significant tax liabilities 
our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems and critical facilities 
we rely on information systems to obtain  rapidly process  analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of inventory items from numerous distribution centers  receive  process and ship orders on a timely basis  manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers  process payments to suppliers  facilitate the manufacturing and assembly of medical products  and generate financial information 
our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities  including our national logistics center 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems or facilities  or our customers access to them  are interrupted  damaged by unforeseen events  cyber security incidents or other actions of third parties  or fail for any extended period of time 
any data security breach could adversely impact our operations  results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal requirements  including those related to patient identifiable health information 
as further described below in item a controls and procedures  the medical segment has implemented a medical business transformation project  which includes a new information system for certain supply chain and financial processes 
if the system fails to operate as intended  it could adversely affect medical segment profit and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
because of the nature of our business  we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 
due to the nature of our businesses  which includes the manufacture and distribution of healthcare products  we may from time to time become involved in disputes or legal proceedings 
for instance  some of the products we manufacture or distribute may be alleged to cause personal injury or violate the intellectual property rights of another party  subjecting us to product liability or infringement claims 
while we generally obtain indemnity rights from the manufacturers of products we distribute and we carry product liability insurance  it is possible that liability from such claims could exceed those protections 
litigation is inherently unpredictable  and the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these legal proceedings could adversely affect our cash flows or results of operations 
acquisitions are not always as successful as we expect them to be 
an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses 
acquisitions involve risks we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition  or we may encounter unforeseen accounting  internal control  regulatory or compliance issues 

table of contents we depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products 
we depend on the availability of various components  compounds  raw materials including radioisotopes and energy supplied by others for our operations 
any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to events beyond our control  including natural disasters  or could be terminated 
a sustained supply interruption could have an adverse effect on our business 
our manufacturing businesses use oil based resins  cotton  latex  and other commodities as raw materials in many products 
prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs 
prices of these commodities are volatile and have fluctuated significantly in recent years  so costs to produce and distribute our products also have fluctuated 
due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations  we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices 
if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions  or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our global operations are subject to economic  political and currency risks 
our global operations are affected by local economic environments  including inflation  recession  currency volatility and competition 
political changes also can disrupt our global operations  as well as our customers and suppliers  in a particular location 
we may not be able to hedge or obtain insurance to protect us against these risks  and any hedges or insurance may be expensive and may not successfully mitigate these risks 
economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services 
deterioration in general economic conditions in the united states and other countries in which we do business could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions filled and the number of medical procedures undertaken and  therefore  reduce purchases of our products and services by our customers  which could adversely affect our results of operations

for additional information regarding discontinued operations  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as noted above  on august   we completed the distribution to our shareholders of percent of the then outstanding common stock of carefusion and retained the remaining million shares of carefusion common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis presented below refers to  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
unless otherwise indicated  throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we are referring to our continuing operations 
overview we are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies  hospitals  surgery centers  physician offices and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs  enhancing efficiency and improving quality 
we report our financial results in two segments pharmaceutical and medical 
during fiscal  we achieved revenue of billion and increased our operating earnings by percent to billion 
our growth in revenue was due to increased volume from existing customers billion and acquisitions billion 
the increase in operating earnings reflects strong performance in our pharmaceutical segment generic programs  the positive impact of acquisitions  and a million gain realized upon adjusting the contingent consideration obligation associated with the p healthcare acquisition 
earnings from continuing operations were up percent for the twelve months ended june  due to the factors discussed above 
our cash and equivalents balance was billion as of june   compared to billion as of june  the increase in cash and equivalents was primarily attributable to net cash provided by operating activities of billion  partially offset by share repurchases of million and cash dividends of million 
we plan to continue to execute a balanced deployment of available capital to position ourselves for sustainable competitive advantage and to enhance shareholder value 
trends within our pharmaceutical segment  we expect revenue to decrease in fiscal the factors contributing to this decrease include reduced revenue as a result of branded to generic pharmaceutical conversions and the expiration on september  of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts  inc branded to generic pharmaceutical conversions impact our revenues because generic pharmaceuticals generally sell at a lower price than the corresponding branded product and because some of our customers source generic products directly from manufacturers rather than purchasing from us 
our contract with express scripts  inc was not renewed in connection with the combined pharmaceutical distribution contract that was not awarded to us following that company s merger with medco health solutions  inc we recognized approximately billion of revenue from sales to express scripts  inc in fiscal  all of which was classified as bulk sales 
in our pharmaceutical segment  we also anticipate fewer significant new generic pharmaceutical product launches in fiscal however  the impact of these launches on our gross margin can vary depending on the timing  size and number of entrants 
within our medical segment  variability in the cost of commodities such as oil based resins  cotton  latex  diesel fuel and other commodities can have a significant impact on the cost of products sold 
although commodity prices fluctuate  we do not expect changes in commodity prices to have a significant impact on our year over year results of operations in fiscal the healthcare reform acts include a tax to be paid by medical device manufacturers equal to percent of the price for which manufacturers sell their products  which is scheduled to begin january  we manufacture and sell devices that  based on the currently proposed rules  will be subject to this tax 
there have been proposals to repeal this tax and modify the proposed rules  which if adopted  may reduce the impact of this tax on us 
acquisitions we have completed several acquisitions since july   the largest of which were kinray  p healthcare and cardinal health china  each of which was completed in fiscal in this management s discussion and analysis  we identify the contribution of an acquisition until the one year anniversary of the acquisition 
using this definition  for fiscal and  acquisitions contributed revenues of billion and billion  respectively  and operating earnings of million and million  respectively 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on acquisitions 
spin off of carefusion effective august   we separated our clinical and medical products business through the distribution to our shareholders of percent of the then outstanding common stock of carefusion and retained the remaining million shares of carefusion common stock 
during fiscal and  we disposed of million and million shares of carefusion common stock  respectively 
we entered into a separation agreement with carefusion on july  to effect the spin off and provide a framework for our relationship with carefusion after the spin off 
in addition  on august   we entered into a transition services agreement  a tax matters agreement and an accounts receivable factoring agreement with carefusion  among other agreements 
under the transition services agreement  during fiscal  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  in transition service fee income 

table of contents under the tax matters agreement  carefusion is obligated to indemnify us for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes prior to the spin off 
the indemnification receivable was million and million at june  and  respectively  and is included in other long term assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
under the accounts receivable factoring agreement  during fiscal and  we purchased million and million of carefusion trade receivables  respectively 
the accounts receivable factoring arrangement expired on april  results of operations revenue change revenue in millions pharmaceutical medical total segment corporate nm nm consolidated fiscal compared to fiscal pharmaceutical segment revenue was positively impacted during fiscal by acquisitions billion and increased sales to existing customers billion 
revenue from bulk sales was billion and billion for fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  revenue from bulk sales decreased percent as a result of the conversion of branded pharmaceuticals to generic pharmaceuticals as well as a shift in sales mix for certain retail chain pharmacy customers to non bulk from bulk 
revenue from non bulk sales was billion and billion for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from non bulk sales increased percent during fiscal  primarily due to acquisitions and the previously mentioned shift in sales 
see item business for more information about bulk and non bulk sales 
medical segment revenue was positively impacted during fiscal by increased volume from existing customers million  including the positive impact from sales of self manufactured and private brand products and the transition during the fourth quarter of fiscal of our relationship with carefusion from a fee for service arrangement to a traditional distribution model million 
this transition had minimal impact on medical segment profit 
fiscal compared to fiscal pharmaceutical segment during fiscal  pharmaceutical revenue was positively impacted by acquisitions  net of divestitures billion and increased sales to existing customers billion 
revenue was negatively impacted by losses of customers in excess of gains million 
medical segment medical revenue was positively impacted during fiscal by increased volume from existing customers million 
these revenue gains were partially offset by the impact of lost customers in excess of gains million and decreased volume as a result of strong demand for flu related products in the prior year million

these costs are retained at corporate 
investment spending generally includes the first year spend for certain projects which require incremental strategic investments in the form of additional operating expenses 
we encourage our segments to identify investment projects which will promote innovation and provide future returns 
as approval decisions for such projects are dependent upon executive management  the expenses for such projects are often retained at corporate 
in addition  spin off costs included within sg a are not allocated to our segments 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on segment profit 
pharmaceutical segment profit the principal drivers for the increase in fiscal and were strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs  including the impact of new product launches  the positive impact of acquisitions  and increased margin under branded pharmaceutical agreements  offset by the unfavorable impact of pharmaceutical distribution customer pricing changes 
see the discussion of gross margin above for further information on these drivers 
segment profit from bulk sales increased million in fiscal over fiscal and was percent of pharmaceutical segment profit in both years 
segment profit from non bulk sales increased million in fiscal over fiscal and was percent of pharmaceutical segment profit in both years 
the generic pharmaceutical programs and acquisitions discussed above primarily impacted segment profit from non bulk sales 
medical segment profit the principal drivers for the decrease in fiscal were the increased cost of commodities used in our self manufactured products and an increase in sg a expenditures  including the impact of business system investments 
these items were partially offset by the favorable impact of product sales mix and increased net sales volume 
see the discussion above for further information on these drivers 

table of contents results for fiscal were adversely affected by increased cost of commodities used in our self manufactured products partially offset by increased sales volume 
results also were impacted by the negative year over year impact of recognizing in fiscal a one time gain related to previously deferred intercompany revenue for sales to carefusion 
consolidated operating earnings in addition to revenue  gross margin and sg a discussed above  operating earnings were impacted by the following in millions restructuring and employee severance acquisition related costs impairments and loss on disposal of assets litigation recoveries charges  net restructuring and employee severance fiscal and restructuring and employee severance charges included million and million  respectively  of costs arising from the spin off 
acquisition related costs acquisition related costs for fiscal included income realized upon adjusting the contingent consideration obligation incurred in connection with the p healthcare acquisition 
the former owners of p healthcare had the right to receive certain contingent payments based on targeted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda 
as a result of changes in our estimate of performance in future periods due in large part to the loss of revenue from a significant customer of the p healthcare legacy business in fiscal  we revised the timing and amount of ebitda estimates and made changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the ebitda targets 
these changes  coupled with the progress of discussions with the former owners regarding an early termination and settlement of the contingent consideration obligation  resulted in a million decrease in the fair value of the obligation to million at june  in early july  we reached final settlement and payment of the remaining contingent consideration liability for million

gain on sale of investment in carefusion common stock we recognized million and million of income during fiscal and  respectively  related to the sale of our investment in carefusion common stock 
provision for income taxes generally  fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and united states state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items 
a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows for fiscal  and see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed disclosure of the effective tax rate reconciliation provision at federal statutory rate state and local income taxes  net of federal benefit foreign tax rate differential nondeductible nontaxable items change in measurement of an uncertain tax position and an irs settlement valuation allowances unremitted foreign earnings other effective income tax rate

the year over year comparison of the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the release in fiscal of a previously established deferred tax valuation allowance 
fiscal compared to fiscal the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by million  or percentage points  attributable to recognizing no income tax expense on the sale of carefusion stock due to the release of a previously established deferred tax valuation allowance 
an unfavorable charge of million  or percentage points  attributable to earnings no longer indefinitely invested offshore in fiscal favorably impacted the year over year comparison of the effective tax rate 
ongoing audits during fiscal  the irs closed audits of fiscal and  and is currently conducting audits of fiscal years through we have received proposed adjustments from the irs for fiscal through related to our transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among subsidiaries of an acquired entity prior to its acquisition by us 
the irs has proposed additional taxes of million  excluding penalties and interest 
if this tax ultimately must be paid  carefusion is liable under the tax matters agreement for million of the total amount 
we disagree with these proposed adjustments  which we are contesting  and have accounted for the unrecognized tax benefits related to them 
earnings loss from discontinued operations carefusion operating results are included within earnings from discontinued operations for all periods through the date of the spin off  and had a significant impact on earnings from discontinued operations for fiscal see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources we currently believe that  based upon available capital resources cash on hand  projected operating cash flow  and access to committed credit facilities  we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs  currently anticipated capital expenditures  business growth and expansion  contractual obligations  payments for tax settlements  and current and projected debt service requirements  dividends and share repurchases 
during fiscal  we completed several small acquisitions with cash on hand 
if we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions  depending on the size and timing of such transactions  we may need supplemental funding 
cash and equivalents our cash and equivalents balance was billion at june   compared to billion at june  at june   our cash and cash equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality  short term liquid investments 
the increase in cash and equivalents during fiscal was primarily attributable to net cash provided by operating activities of billion and net proceeds of million from the sale and repayment of notes

table of contents we use days sales outstanding dso  days inventory on hand dioh and days payable outstanding dpo to evaluate our working capital performance 
dso is calculated as trade receivables  net divided by average daily revenue during the last month of the reporting period 
dioh is calculated as inventories divided by average daily cost of products sold and chargeback billings during the last quarter of the reporting period 
dpo is calculated as accounts payable divided by average daily cost of products sold and chargeback billings during the last quarter of the reporting period 
chargeback billings are the difference between a product s wholesale acquisition cost and the contract price established between the vendors and the end customer 
days sales outstanding days inventory on hand days payable outstanding changes in working capital can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of inventory purchases  customer payments of accounts receivable  and payments to vendors in the regular course of business 
dso increased in fiscal as a result of the medical segment s business transformation project implementation  which led to an increase in trade receivables at june  dioh increased in fiscal as a result of inventory increases related to on boarding a new pharmaceutical customer and the medical segment s business transformation project implementation 
the increase in dso in fiscal was driven by the impact of acquisitions and the increase in dpo was due to the timing of payments to vendors in the regular course of business 
the cash and equivalents balance at the end of fiscal included million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states 
although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation  permanently bringing the money into the united states could trigger us federal  state and local income tax obligations 
as a us parent company  we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without becoming subject to us federal income tax through intercompany loans 
in fiscal  we expect two matters to adversely affect our operating cash flows by approximately million compared to fiscal specifically  we anticipate that we will make cash payments to the irs as we work to reach resolution on audits of fiscal through  however  we can provide no assurance regarding the likelihood or timing of reaching resolution 
we also expect a negative working capital impact from the expiration of our contract with express scripts  inc ownership of carefusion common stock during fiscal and  we disposed of million and million shares of carefusion common stock for cash proceeds of million and million  respectively 
we have no remaining ownership in carefusion 
credit facilities and commercial paper our sources of liquidity include a billion revolving credit facility and a million committed receivables sales facility program 
at times  availability under our committed receivables sales facility program may be less than million based on receivables concentration limits and our outstanding eligible receivables balance

the notes mature on june  these notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
we used the proceeds to repay million of our notes due june  the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes  which may include repayment of other indebtedness  including million aggregate principal of our notes due june  
table of contents capital expenditures capital expenditures during fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively  primarily related to information technology projects 
we expect capital expenditures in fiscal to be less than in fiscal we anticipate that we will be able to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities 
fiscal capital expenditures will be largely focused on information technology projects 
dividends during fiscal  we paid quarterly dividends of per share  or per share on an annualized basis  an increase of percent from fiscal on may   our board of directors approved a percent increase in our quarterly dividend to per share  or per share on an annualized basis  payable on july  to shareholders of record on july  on august   our board of directors approved our th consecutive regular quarterly dividend  payable to shareholders of record on october  share repurchases during fiscal and  we repurchased million and million of our common shares  respectively 
at june   we had million remaining under our then current repurchase authorization which was to expire november  on august   our board of directors approved a new million share repurchase program  which expires august   and canceled the share repurchase program which was to expire november  interest rate and currency risk management we use foreign currency forward contracts  interest rate swaps and commodity swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability 
we also use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of our existing foreign currency assets and liabilities and interest rate swaps to protect the value of our debt 
see item a below as well as notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives as well as foreign currency  interest rate and commodity exposures

represents cash outflows by period for certain of our long term liabilities in which cash outflows could be reasonably estimated 
certain long term liabilities  such as unrecognized tax benefits and deferred taxes  including those related to the audits of fiscal through  have been excluded from the table above because of the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions or because of the inability to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash outflows 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes

purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and specifying all significant terms  including the following fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and approximate timing of the transaction 
the purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur 
purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table

recent financial accounting standards see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent financial accounting standards 

table of contents critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations for continuing operations and ii require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
because estimates are inherently uncertain  actual results may differ 
in this section  we describe the policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us through our distribution businesses and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million at june  and  respectively 
we also provide financing to various customers 
such financing arrangements range from days to years at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation 
interest income on these arrangements is recognized as it is earned 
financings may be collateralized  guaranteed by third parties or unsecured 
finance notes and accrued interest receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million at june  and  respectively  and are included in other assets current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other 
we must use judgment when deciding whether to extend credit and when estimating the required allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts includes portfolio and specific reserves 
we determine the appropriate allowance by reviewing accounts receivable aging  industry trends  customer financial strength and credit standing  historical write off trends and payment history 
we also regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risks 
our methodology for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts is assessed annually based on historical losses and economic  business and market trends 
in addition  the allowance is reviewed quarterly and updated if appropriate 
we may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if changes in customers financial condition or general economic conditions make defaults more frequent or severe 
the following table gives information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years 
in millions  except percentages allowance for doubtful accounts allowance as a percentage of customer receivables allowance as a percentage of revenue reduction to allowance for customer deductions and write offs addition to allowance a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables  sales type leases and finance notes receivables at june   would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of million 
we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal are appropriate 
at this time  we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 
inventories a substantial portion of inventories percent and percent at june   and  respectively are stated at the lower of cost  using the lifo method  or market 
these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment 
the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year depends on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory 
prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise  which results in an increase in cost of products sold  whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline  which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 
the lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold  so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue 
using lifo  if branded pharmaceutical inventory levels decline  the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise over time  so our older inventory is held at a lower cost 
conversely  if generic pharmaceutical inventory levels decline  future cost of products sold generally will increase prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline over time  so our older inventory is held at a higher cost 
we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation reasonably approximates the current cost of replacing inventory within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities 
accordingly  the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 
the remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost  using the fifo first in  first out method  or market 
if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities  the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal or primarily because prices for our generic pharmaceutical inventories have continued to decline  inventories at lifo were million and million higher than the average cost value as of june   and  respectively 
we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost 
as such  we did not record any changes in our lifo reserve in fiscal and inventories recorded on the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  which were million and million at june   and  respectively 
we determine reserves for inventory obsolescence based on historical experience  sales trends  specific categories of inventory and age of on hand inventory 
if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions  additional inventory reserves may be required 

table of contents business combinations the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition  including identifiable intangible assets 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions 
critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for trade names  customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets  discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows  and estimates of useful lives 
when an acquisition involves contingent consideration  we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the date of acquisition 
the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration obligation requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results  discount rates and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios 
subsequent revisions to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration obligations and therefore could materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our acquisitions 
goodwill and other intangibles purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist 
intangible assets with finite lives  primarily customer relationships  trademarks and patents  and non compete agreements  are amortized over their useful lives 
goodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount 
if estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount  then no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value  then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment  if any  which would be recorded as an expense to our results of operations 
application of goodwill impairment testing involves judgment  including the identification of reporting units and estimating the fair value of each reporting unit 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component 
we have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical 
these operating segments are comprised of divisions components  for which discrete financial information is available 
components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics 
our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear and pharmacy services division and cardinal health china pharmaceutical division  nuclear and pharmacy services division  cardinal health china pharmaceutical division  and medical operating segment 
fair value can be determined using market  income or cost based approaches 
our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the income based and market based approaches 
under the market based approach  we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets 
under the income based approach  we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods  plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon  are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return 
to further confirm the fair value  we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization 
the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment 
we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal  and and concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
for our fiscal testing  we elected to bypass the optional qualitative assessment  as permitted by the amended accounting guidance adopted during the year 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 
if we alter our impairment testing by increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis by percent  there still would not be any impairment indicated for any of our reporting units for fiscal  or vendor reserves in the ordinary course of business  our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other billing disputes 
these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon our policy and findings of the research performed 
at any given time  there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution 
in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors  we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims 
we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review 
though the transaction types are relatively consistent  we periodically refine our estimate methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience 
changes to the estimate percentages affect the cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 
vendor reserves were million and million at june  and  respectively 
approximately percent of the vendor reserve at the end of fiscal pertained to the pharmaceutical segment compared to percent at the end of fiscal the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from period to period  timing of settlements  and specific vendor issues  such as bankruptcies 
the ultimate outcome of specific claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment 
we believe  however  that reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

table of contents provision for income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
the following table presents information about our tax position in millions net deferred income tax assets net deferred income tax liabilities net loss and credit carryforwards included in net deferred income tax assets net valuation allowance against deferred tax assets this valuation allowance primarily relates to federal  state and international loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually 
after applying the valuation allowances  we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
however  other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued 
tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed disclosure of the unrecognized tax benefits 
if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change  an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by percent on earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations would have caused income tax expense to increase or decrease by million for fiscal share based compensation all share based payments to employees  including grants of options  are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair value of stock options is determined using a lattice valuation model 
we believe the lattice model provides reasonable estimates because it has the ability to take into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptions 
we analyzed historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to be used within the lattice model 
the expected life of the options granted was calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding 
expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant up to ten years 
as required  the forfeiture estimates will be adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests 
the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than our current estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding share based compensation 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our businesses are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks 
these market risks primarily relate to foreign exchange  interest rate and commodity price related changes 
we maintain a hedging program to manage volatility related to these market exposures which employs operational  economic and derivative financial instruments in order to mitigate risk 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our use of derivative instruments 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity by nature of our global operations  our businesses are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation 
these exposures are transactional and translational in nature 
principal drivers of this foreign exchange exposure include the canadian dollar  chinese renminbi  european euro  japanese yen  malaysian ringgit  mexican peso  and thai baht 
transactional exposure our businesses transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
as part of our risk management program  at the end of each fiscal year we perform a sensitivity analysis on our forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year 
the fiscal and fiscal analyses utilized a currency portfolio model  encompassing both implied volatility and historical correlation to estimate the net potential gain or loss 
these analyses included the estimated impact of our hedging program  which mitigates our transactional exposure 
at each of june  and  we had hedged approximately percent of our businesses transactional exposures 
the following table summarizes the analysis as it relates to our transactional exposure and the impact of a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in millions net estimated transactional exposure sensitivity gain loss estimated offsetting impact of hedges estimated net gain loss translational exposure we have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into us dollars  our functional currency 
we perform a similar analysis as described above related to this translational exposure 
we do not typically hedge any of our translational exposure and no hedging impact was included in our analysis at june  and the following table summarizes our translational exposure and the impact of a hypothetical percent strengthening or weakening in the us dollar in millions net estimated translational exposure sensitivity gain loss interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
the nature and amount of our long term and short term debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
our policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management 
we utilize interest rate swap instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate movements 
as part of our risk management program  we perform an annual sensitivity analysis on our forecasted exposure to interest rates for the following fiscal year 
this analysis assumes a hypothetical percent change in interest rates 
at june  and  the potential increase or decrease in net annual interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was million and million  respectively 
commodity price sensitivity we are exposed to market price changes for commodities  including oil based resins  cotton  latex  and diesel fuel 
we typically purchase raw materials at market prices and some finished goods at prices based in part on a commodity price index 
as part of our risk management program  we perform sensitivity analysis on our forecasted commodity exposure for the following fiscal year 
our forecasted commodity exposure as of june  decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of commodity prices and changes in purchasing volumes 
at june  and  we had hedged a portion of these commodity exposures see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the table below summarizes our analysis of these forecasted commodity exposures and a hypothetical percent fluctuation in commodity prices as of june  and in millions estimated commodity exposure sensitivity gain loss estimated offsetting impact of hedges estimated net gain loss we have additional exposure to commodities through the purchase of finished goods and various other energy related commodities  including natural gas and electricity through our normal course of business where our contracts are not directly tied to a commodity index 
we believe our total gross range of exposure to commodities  including the items listed in the table above  is million to million as of june
