this section provides information necessary to evaluate our ability to generate cash and to meet existing and known future cash requirements over both the short and long term 
references to   and refer to the weeks period ended january  and january   and the week period ended january  overview the company we are trusted by the world s leading companies to advance their reputations by aligning their communications with corporate standards and priorities 
by partnering with our customers  we help them increase efficiency  comply with regulatory requirements  improve the way they communicate with and serve their customers  employees  and stakeholders  and ultimately thrive in today s competitive business climate 
we continue to build a portfolio of solutions to address the changing business landscape for our primary markets 
we help companies migrate from paper based to digital processes by providing innovative tools to manage the entire lifecycle of their documents from concept to delivery 
to accomplish this  we utilize our market expertise to provide products and services including printed documents and communications  labels  nationwide warehousing and custom delivery services  consulting  and software solutions 
our operations include four reportable segments based upon the primary markets we serve healthcare  financial services  commercial markets  and industrial 
our business challenges advances in on demand technologies have accelerated the adoption of electronic distribution of documents and digital printing  therefore reducing the market for longer run traditional business forms  a legacy product offering of the company 
in addition  the downturn in the economy and turmoil in the credit markets in recent years have created highly competitive conditions in an already over supplied  price competitive industry 
we have taken substantial measures to transform our company to be leaders in our primary markets 
going forward  we believe our success is dependent upon addressing the following key challenges transformation of our portfolio of solutions future pension funding requirements and amortization of actuarial gains and losses generating positive cash flow expanding market share in core markets developing a targeted approach in global expansion transformation of our portfolio of solutions traditional business documents and information driven processes are essential in order to conduct business 
however  many printed documents and related services are being replaced or commoditized by advances in digital technologies  causing significant price pressures and steady declines in demand for a large portion of our legacy product line 
the same digital advances also introduce new opportunities with significant growth potential for us  such as print on demand services and solutions that assist customers in their transition to digital business environments 
these growth opportunities are particularly enhanced within our four market segments due to our extensive history and experience 
at the end of  we began the process of evolving into a market focused innovator 
in  we transformed from a product driven company to one focused on the key markets we serve and we aligned management roles and resources to create an intense focus on customer needs within our four primary markets 
in and  we continued our transformation and focused on providing and developing new solutions for growth and durability 
a key example of this in is our investment in new digital color equipment and technology 
the investment supports our strategy for growth in core marketing solutions by helping our customers manage their brand through effective color execution and increased security and efficiency in their critical communications 
optimization of our manufacturing footprint and implementation of new workflow and print technology in our print on demand centers in was an important first step operationally 
we transformed five of our regional print centers into super centers  equipping each with high speed  high quality color printing  and in line finishing and bindery capabilities 
in addition  the regional centers and our three largest satellite facilities were upgraded with the latest high speed  monochrome printing equipment as well as wide format printers 
advances in production were complemented by new digital workflow technology  which was rolled out across our entire digital print network 
the software allows web based orders to move from customer desktops through the production process with minimal intervention 
it automatically routes orders to the print center most convenient to the customer  which dramatically improves fulfillment times and reduces freight costs for the customer 
these investments create a strategic advantage for us by allowing us to capitalize on growth opportunities in web publishing 
during and  we renewed our emphasis on leveraging our intellectual property to further develop and enhance our solution portfolio  resulting in new inventions and patents 
we also made strategic acquisitions 
in  we acquired of the ownership interest in dialog medical 
dialog medical provides solutions for managing the patient informed consent process 
we believe this acquisition strengthens and broadens our leadership in the healthcare market  compliments our portfolio of solutions  and enhances our ability to continue to advance our core growth products in the healthcare market 
in  we purchased the assets of fusion graphics  inc the assets consisted primarily of patented in mold label products and intellectual property  including the grafilm in mold labeling system 
the acquisition is expected to allow us to serve a much broader group of customers worldwide and continue to develop new products within our industrial business unit 
building on these technologies  we launched our new grafilm roto in mold labeling product in the fourth quarter of we have also developed strategic relationships with outside partners and invested in additional talent to further drive growth and development of innovative solutions that address the needs of our core markets 
as a result of these investments  we expect to continue to grow and develop innovative solutions  specifically in the areas of patient identification and safety solutions  secure document solutions  marketing and critical communication solutions  and industrial in mold labeling 
these solutions address important business needs and are positioned for future growth 
they have also contributed to the shift in our revenue from legacy to core solutions 
core solutions  as a percent of total revenue  were in  compared with in and in we believe our extensive expertise within our markets combined with our continued focus on targeted solutions for those markets will differentiate us from our competitors and will continue to produce growth opportunities outside of our legacy solutions 
future pension funding and loss amortization during   and most recently in and  our qualified pension plan became underfunded due to weak stock market returns and historically low long term interest rates 
the amortization of these actuarial losses has resulted in significant pension loss amortization in recent years million in  million in  and million in we expect this trend to continue and that pension loss amortization will continue to materially impact our operating profit in future years 
based upon current estimates of funding  asset performance  and interest rates  we project pension loss amortization to be million in due to the high degree of variability and uncertainty regarding the assumptions used to determine these amounts  actual results could differ significantly from those expected 
the pension protection act of became effective in and increased the minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plan 
in response to the weak economic conditions  the pension relief act of pra was passed in the pra provides funding relief specifically for plan years by allowing plan sponsors to stretch out funding over a longer period of time for two of these years 
based upon the new requirements and current estimates  our minimum funding is estimated to be million in  million in  and million in our estimates of minimum funding requirements are also dependent upon investment return and interest rate assumptions that have a high degree of variability and uncertainty  as evidenced in the recent economic climate 
unexpected gains or losses in asset values or changes in factors affecting interest rates could materially impact the actual required contributions 
in response to these challenges  in we modified our qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans 
as a result  participants in these plans ceased accruing additional pension benefits in july  and the final pension amounts will be based upon pay and service through june  the effect of these actions eliminated pension service costs for these plans for and beyond  resulting in annualized net savings of approximately million in retirement costs 
in addition  some variability in the actuarial gains and losses of these plans were eliminated as estimates of service periods and compensation levels are no longer required since plan benefits have been frozen 
despite these changes  settlement of our pension obligations will still present uncertainty and variability in our financial results in future years  with the ultimate outcome determined by actual asset performance in our qualified plan  interest rates  and the level of our pension contributions 
generating positive cash flow transforming our product portfolio and funding our pension plan creates additional challenges related to generating and maintaining positive cash flow due to the significant cash investments required 
pricing pressures in our legacy product line as these products are further commoditized create additional pressures on cash 
our core solutions generally generate higher profit margins  therefore  our continued shift from legacy to core solutions will help offset these pressures 
we continue to undertake aggressive actions to accelerate our transition  reduce costs  and align resources around our core solutions business 
significant restructuring actions have been implemented to improve our cost structure  most recently late in the plan is expected to reduce costs by approximately million annually and allow us to continue to maintain sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund near term operations and growth initiatives 
additionally  due to the lack of a statutory surplus required under ohio law  we have suspended our dividend  which will result in the retention of approximately million of capital annually 
expanding market share in core markets in and  we continued to grow market share  optimize operations and earnings  and develop new solutions for growth and durability 
we achieved positive results  as we acquired new customers and expanded business with existing customers across all of our segments 
we continued to advance our market positions by developing key partnerships and alliances  providing us with new opportunities for growth targeted products and increased market share in our legacy print products 
additionally  we continued investing in system and infrastructure enhancements  including a refresh of our web based smartworks platform 
these enhancements provide advanced web based capabilities for our customers  reduce costs  and create operating efficiencies  all of which allow us opportunities to expand our market share through client service and reinvestment in solutions 
as demand for traditional print products is projected to decline approximately to per year  the continued expansion of our market share is a key factor to our success 
we believe our current strategic plans will continue to drive further expansion of our market share in the us going forward 
developing a targeted approach to global expansion since many of our customers have a global presence  we believe we must also increase our ability to provide solutions that support global requirements and are working to develop plans to achieve this 
our focus in  we continued to focus on our customers  creating cost and operational improvements and efficiencies  and cash flow 
as a result of aligning our organization around our key markets  implementing and progressing with our go to market strategy  and creating an internal structure for continuous cost and revenue improvement  we have made substantial progress in these areas 
building on this success  our priorities continue to center around our customers and operational and profit improvement acquire new customers defend and expand current business optimize cost structure 
to offset expected declines in legacy product demand  we will continue plans to acquire new customers 
we have made investments in our business development and marketing organizations and will continue to invest in alternate sales channels 
by successfully combining legacy print product capabilities with technological capabilities  we offer complete solutions that we expect to give us a competitive advantage in acquiring new customers 
we believe the key to our success is our customers 
our intense focus on our customers needs is intended to foster customer loyalty  and we have developed processes and tools to assist in building loyalty  extending our relationships  and measuring and ensuring customer satisfaction 
we will continue to monitor our progress and sponsor additional market focused customer councils to further enhance our understanding of customer needs and how we can better serve them 
by focusing on customer loyalty  we are ensuring that we have a clear understanding of how our customers view us and can develop specific action plans regarding retaining and expanding our business 
we expect to continue to optimize our cost structure and align our operations around our core solutions 
our realignment around vertical markets has enabled us to focus our efforts on providing valuable solutions to markets where we are trusted industry leaders and have extensive understanding of document and information management needs 
in  organizational excellence continues to be our goal  and we expect to continue refining our processes to ensure that each person and process in the company is aligned with our strategic goals 
we will also continue to critically evaluate costs and improve productivity in order to stay cost competitive and most importantly  generate positive cash flow 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we applied the accounting policies disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based on information presently available  and actual results may differ significantly from those estimates 
we consider the estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they place the most significant demands on management s judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and the impact of different estimates or assumptions is material to our financial condition or results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates are discussed throughout this discussion and analysis where such estimates affect reported and expected financial results 
the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions discussed below for the pension plan  fair value measurements  deferred taxes  and environmental liabilities generally do not affect segment results 
however  changes in revenue recognition could impact individual segment results 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
pension benefit plan assumptions included in our financial statements are significant pension obligations and benefit costs which are measured using actuarial valuations 
the use of actuarial models requires us to make certain assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments 
such assumptions include the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in addition  the actuarial calculation includes subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to estimate the projected benefit obligation 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may have a significant impact on the amount of pension obligations and benefit expense recorded in future periods 
discount rate one of the principal components of calculating the projected benefit obligation and certain components of pension benefit costs is the assumed discount rate 
the discount rate is the assumed rate at which future pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate established at year end for the benefit obligations is also used in the calculation of the interest component of benefit cost for the following year 
discount rates are established based on prevailing market rates for high quality  fixed income instruments with maturities equal to the future cash flows to pay the benefit obligations when due 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets one of the principal components of the net periodic pension cost calculation is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the required use of an expected long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and therefore result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by our employees 
our qualified defined benefit pension plan s assets are invested in a broadly diversified portfolio consisting primarily of publicly traded common stocks and fixed income securities 
we use long term historical actual return experience and estimates of future long term investment return  with consideration to the expected investment mix of the plan s assets  to develop our expected rate of return assumption used in the net periodic pension cost calculation 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the pension cost calculation over five years using a five year  market related asset value method of amortization 
the amortization of these differences has  and will continue to have  a significant effect on net periodic pension cost 
our non qualified pension benefit plans are unfunded plans and have no plan assets 
therefore  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is not a factor in accounting for these benefit plans 
assumptions regarding mortality one of the assumptions made in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation is an estimate of mortality rates for the population of pension participants 
our actuaries use mortality tables  which include death rates for each age  in estimating the amount of pension benefits that will become payable 
the mortality tables include the proportion of the number of deaths in a specified group to the number living at the beginning of the period in which the deaths occur 
we use the rp mortality table to determine benefit obligations and to determine pension and postretirement benefit cost 
we review the assumptions used to account for our pension obligations and benefit cost each fiscal year end 
weighted average assumptions projected benefit obligation discount rate used for pension obligations holding all other assumptions constant a increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation recorded by approximately million 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase the pension obligation recorded by approximately million 
net periodic pension benefit cost discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets the discount rate was through march  and april through december due to settlements that occurred on march  as a result  pension expense was adjusted to reflect the updated discount rate at that time 
holding all other assumptions constant a increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase pension cost by approximately million 
a increase or decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase pension benefit cost by million 
the long term rate of return on plan assets we expect to use to determine fiscal net periodic pension cost is  the same as in in  we recorded non cash actuarial losses of million to accumulated other comprehensive income 
we currently have a total of million of actuarial losses  net of deferred tax benefits  related to our pension plans that will be amortized to expense in future years 
amortization of actuarial losses is expected to be approximately million in we expect amortization expense to trend higher in future periods based on current estimates of funding  asset performance  and interest rates 
due to the high degree of variability and uncertainty in these assumptions  actual results could differ significantly 
goodwill during the second quarter of  we performed the annual impairment test for goodwill 
the test was performed at the reporting unit level using the two step approach required by generally accepted accounting principles 
the first step of the test required us to compare the fair value of the reporting units to the carrying value of the assets assigned to those reporting units  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value  step two is completed to determine the amount of the impairment loss 
to determine fair value  we followed an income approach utilizing a discounted future cash flow methodology 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units required us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  and future economic and market conditions 
in addition  we made certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
though we believe our assumptions are reasonable  actual financial results could be different due to unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 
the following describes the key assumptions used in our fair value calculations revenue and cost assumptions using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques  we projected revenue and costs for the remainder of through factory cost revenue forecasts were based on both historical information and the company s current strategic plan 
a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream based on the three year cash flow 
we calculated three outcomes a most likely  a best case  and a worst case based on future cash flow projections 
all outcomes were weighted to arrive at an overall projected cash flow 
discount rate determination we used the industry weighted average cost of capital that reflects the weighted average return on debt and equity of our peer group from a market participant perspective 
the results of our test indicated that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying value  therefore  goodwill was not impaired 
in addition to calculating a range of possible outcomes  we also performed a sensitivity analysis designed to understand the relative impact of the major assumptions used in our calculations 
if our estimate of expected future cash flows had been lower  or there was a variation in either the terminal value or the discount rate  the expected future cash flows would still have exceeded the carrying value of the assets  including goodwill 
deferred taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and mexico 
significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities  any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  and our provision for income taxes  including tax positions taken or to be taken in our tax returns 
at january   we had net deferred tax assets of million attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we review the potential future tax benefits of all deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
the company concluded after evaluating all positive and negative evidence regarding the potential realization of the company s deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is necessary primarily based on cumulative losses in recent years  defined as the current and two preceding years and current year actuarial pension losses 
a valuation allowance is being recorded against the entire us net deferred tax asset except for million related to the pension liability 
we are forecasting that the pension liability will be reduced by future actuarial gains prior to funding the related liability  therefore  the deferred tax asset will be realized without the need for future taxable income 
because of the cumulative losses in recent years  the company is not relying on forecasts of future taxable income to realize any us deferred tax assets 
the amount of our deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could change if our estimates of business results or future taxable income change 
we also have a canadian capital loss carryforward that has an indefinite carryforward period 
a full valuation allowance has been provided for the tax benefit associated with this capital loss as it is more likely than not that this capital loss will not be utilized 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates 
since the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted  changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
as the economic recovery continues to be sluggish and as issues of debt reduction  global competitiveness  and job creation dominate the national discussion  pressure is clearly building for congress to lower the corporate rate 
president obama s deficit reduction commission recommended a rate between and  while others have suggested a drop to 
if enacted  the effect of a change in corporate tax rates on our tax expense and deferred taxes will be dependent on the amount of our tax valuation allowance 
environmental remediation we are currently involved in the remediation of three environmental sites that are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with accounting standards for environmental liabilities  we have recorded an estimate of the total costs to remediate these sites 
however  due to the lengthy nature in settling environmental obligations and the fact that final remedies have not been determined for two of the sites  determining total costs requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
areas requiring the most significant judgments and estimates include the extent and timing of final remediation actions and the estimation of our share of the final remedy 
due to the complexity of environmental issues  monitoring costs can extend for many years 
we must also estimate all costs related to the final remedy  which frequently involves complex procedures that can vary significantly from original plans depending on actual conditions encountered on the site 
until final remediation approaches are approved and final agreements are reached among all prps  it is reasonably possible that one or more of these factors could change our estimates  however  we are unable to determine the impact at this time 
revenue recognition we enter into arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as software  professional services  and ongoing maintenance and post contract customer support 
we account for the licensing of software arrangements in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards for software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element  and allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 
changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could change the timing or amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
we also enter into arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as custom printed products  warehousing services  and custom delivery services 
during  we adopted a new accounting standard that requires us to use a hierarchy to allocate arrangement consideration to each element in the arrangement 
the hierarchy requires the use of vsoe  third party evidence of selling price tpe  or best estimate of selling price besp 
vsoe represents the price of the deliverable when sold on a stand alone basis  while tpe represents the price that outside vendors charge on a stand alone basis 
besp is management s best estimate of the selling price on a stand alone basis using available internal and external data and should be used only when vsoe or tpe cannot be established 
two of our deliverables  custom printed products and warehousing services  require the use of besp 
determining besp requires us to make judgments and assumptions regarding the value of these deliverables on a stand alone basis 
to determine besp  we consider internally generated data such as estimated costs for materials  labor  manufacturing and administrative costs  as well as external data such as observable pricing for similar products and current industry and competitive market conditions 
in addition  we consider product life cycle stages  profit margins  assumed volume activity levels  and typical agreement terms 
we routinely update  analyze  and weight this data based on the significance we believe each assumption bears on the selling prices we ultimately could charge 
as such  our determination of besp requires significant judgment 
we adopted the new accounting standard on a prospective basis for new or materially modified arrangements beginning in the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements  however  future changes in the assumptions utilized or judgments could change the timing or amount of revenue that we report in future periods 
results of operations the discussion that follows provides information which we believe is relevant to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this analysis is presented in the following sections consolidated summary a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for   and segment operating results an analysis of revenue  cost of sales  gross margin  and operating income by segment 
consolidated results the following summarizes our consolidated results for   and in addition  the following table presents non gaap net income  which is a non gaap financial measure and represents net income excluding pension loss amortization  pension settlements and curtailments  postretirement plan termination  restructuring charges  asset impairments  and the deferred tax valuation allowance 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position  or cash flows where amounts are either excluded or included not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the presentation of non gaap information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we believe that this non gaap financial measure provides a more complete understanding of our current underlying operating performance  a clearer comparison of current period results with past reports of financial performance  and greater transparency regarding information used by management in its decision making 
this presentation is similar to the manner in which our board of directors internally evaluates performance

see note inventories of the notes to financial statements includes impairment recorded in other income in in and  we remained focused on transforming our product portfolios within all of our segments and launched new solutions 
economic conditions also showed improvement across our markets  which corresponded to increased order levels 
however  as the recovery in the economy has been slow  customers have continued to focus on cost containment  resulting in pressure on price 
additionally  cost reduction initiatives implemented by our customers and the continued proliferation of technology have driven declines in the use of certain legacy print products  as technology was utilized to reduce or eliminate the need for printed products 
these conditions have led to accelerated rates of decline in our legacy products  particularly during the last half of as a result  overall declines in revenue in legacy print products continue to offset progress made in our core solutions 
the following table details the estimated changes in revenue and cost of sales for and revenue change cost of sales change units price mix revenue the acquisition of new customers  expansion of new business with existing customers  and an upward trend in order levels due to improved economic conditions drove improvement in our unit sales during and however  due to continued pressures on legacy print products  overall units declined 
excluding the extra week of revenue in  the unit decline in was only 
increases in revenue due to price in were driven primarily by the pass through of material price increases 
declines in pricing in were driven by intense price competition and customer efforts to minimize costs  particularly in our commercial markets segment which operates in highly competitive market conditions 
we experienced increased material costs during and successfully passed through these costs  which offset pricing pressures during the following table provides further insight into the changes in revenue by major categories 
chg chg print labels software services other core legacy core print revenue increased in and as we progressed with our go to market strategy and acquired new customers and expanded sales to existing customers 
marketing solutions increased approximately million in and million in critical communication solutions increased approximately million in  but decreased slightly in however  declines in legacy print  primarily business forms and documents  declined approximately million in and million in despite expanding our market share and acquiring new customers 
labels revenue increased in and driven by improved economic conditions and advancement of new solutions such as our in mold labels 
core label products increased approximately million in and million in  which was offset by declines in legacy label products of million and million 
services revenue  primarily warehousing and custom delivery services  declined in and as print revenue volume declined 
many of these services are bundled with printed products and therefore fluctuate with the changes in print revenue 
cost of sales and gross margin in  cost of sales decreased primarily as a result of units due to lower sales volume 
these decreases were offset partially by increases in price resulting from higher material costs and increased costs associated with newly acquired customers and unabsorbed costs due to lower sales volume 
we realized savings from previously implemented cost reduction initiatives  which partially offset these increases 
as a result  the gross margin percentage declined slightly as compared with the decline in cost of sales in was driven primarily by units and price 
units declined due to the overall decrease in sales volume 
we estimate that the reduction in production costs through our restructuring actions  workforce reductions  and cost reduction initiatives taken during accounted for substantially the entire decline in price 
cost reductions were partially offset by an unfavorable product mix 
due to increased opportunities in certain marketing solutions  product mix shifted from some lower cost internally produced products to other higher cost products that are primarily outsourced 
the gross margin percentage in remained consistent with  despite the decline in revenue 
selling  general and administrative expense selling expense general and administrative expense depreciation amortization of pension net actuarial losses other expense total selling  general and administrative expense in  selling compensation and related expenses decreased due to reduced revenue volume and changes in selling compensation plans during the year 
in addition  communication and facility costs were lower as compared to as we continued to realize benefits from previously implemented restructuring and cost reduction initiatives 
these savings were partially offset by increases in business development and training costs 
in  our cost reduction initiatives reduced expenses approximately million  primarily in compensation related expenses  communication service costs  and facility costs 
reductions in communication service costs were enabled in large part by the increased infrastructure investments reported in general and administrative expenses 
product management costs on key priority solutions  new deal support costs in client satisfaction  and business development costs were higher by approximately million as we moved forward with planned investments related to our go to market strategy 
general and administrative expenses declined in as a result of lower employee healthcare costs  planned technology investments  and incentive compensation as compared with in  our restructuring plans and cost reduction initiatives resulted in steady declines in general and administrative expenses 
however  a significant portion of the savings was used for planned investments and increased compensation and related expenses 
investments in system infrastructure projects accounted for an increase of approximately million  of which approximately million was focused on advancing our client facing technology through smartworks 
amortization of pension net actuarial losses increased in and as expected due to significant net actuarial losses recorded in recent years that are required to be amortized in future periods 
based upon current estimates of funding  asset performance  and interest rates  we project pension loss amortization to be million in other expense consists primarily of research and development and other pension and postretirement costs 
primarily as a result of plan modifications  other pension and postretirement costs declined in and these savings were partially offset in as a result of the termination of our postretirement healthcare plan  which is more fully discussed under pension curtailments and settlements 
due to the termination  amortization of unrecognized prior service credits and actuarial losses were approximately million less favorable in we will no longer amortize any unrecognized prior service credits and actuarial losses for this plan in future periods 
this amortization previously had been favorably impacting operating expenses by approximately million per quarter or annually 
pension curtailments and settlements as a result of associates retiring and electing a lump sum payment of their pension benefit  we recorded non cash settlement charges of million and million in and related to our non qualified retirement plan and million in related to our qualified  non qualified  and supplemental executive retirement plans 
a pension settlement charge is recorded when the total lump sum payments for a year exceed total service and interest costs recognized for that year 
the settlement charge recognizes a pro rata portion of the unrecognized actuarial losses at the date of the settlement 
in  we also terminated our postretirement healthcare plan and will no longer offer medical benefits to currently retired employees  effective as of december  because the elimination of these benefits reduced benefits previously earned  this action was treated as a negative plan amendment that reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million 
in addition  the plan amendment also resulted in a net credit of to net postretirement benefit cost for the immediate recognition of previously unrecognized prior service credits and actuarial losses 
this credit was offset by an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income and deferred tax liabilities 
restructuring and other exit costs the company has undertaken cost reduction initiatives and restructuring actions as part of ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies  reduce costs  and maintain a strong financial condition 
we recorded million  million  million  of restructuring and other exit costs in   and related to these initiatives 
we intend to continue to critically evaluate operations and costs and may initiate additional cost reducing initiatives or restructurings in the future 
plans in late  we developed a strategic restructuring program that was announced in january the restructuring program is designed to better align our resources in support of our growing core solutions business and to reduce costs to offset the impact of declining revenue in our legacy operations 
the restructuring program is expected to result in an estimated million in annual savings and the elimination of to of our workforce over the next six to nine months 
approximately million of the savings is expected to be realized in cost of sales  with the remainder realized in sg a expenses 
total costs of the restructuring program are expected to be approximately million  of which million is for involuntary termination costs and million is for contract termination and other associated costs  primarily costs for the relocation of equipment and inventory and fees to a third party to assist with the program implementation 
plans in  we launched a company wide review of business practices and growth acceleration opportunities designed around the priorities of client satisfaction  cost reduction  and increased market coverage 
as a result  we implemented a restructuring plan and numerous organizational improvements to simplify business  move closer to the customer  grow revenue  and improve overall efficiency of our business 
restructuring costs primarily included severance related to workforce reductions  contract termination and other exit costs from the strategic closure of production and distribution facilities and the subsequent relocation of equipment and inventory  and fees to the third party that assisted with the development and implementation of the plan 
all of our plans were completed by the end of  and we have realized substantially all of the projected savings expected 
environmental remediation we currently participate in the remediation of two environmental sites for which final remedies have not yet been determined pasco site and valleycrest site 
prior to  our expenses related to these matters had not been significant 
however  in  we recorded noncash charges of million for estimated costs for environmental remediation 
of this amount  million related to the valleycrest landfill site 
we had participated with other potentially responsible parties of this site from through in  gm stepped into the company s position under the site participation agreement and agreed to indemnify the company against certain future liability in connection with the site 
therefore  we did not previously record a liability for potential remediation costs 
in  we were notified that in connection with gm s bankruptcy filing  gm did not plan to continue contributions to the site  including its contractual obligation to indemnify the company for future liability 
due to this development  we recorded an estimate of our potential liability for remediation costs 
determining the amount of these costs required significant estimates  as we are in the early stages of developing a remediation plan with other potentially responsible parties  and final potentially responsible parties and their respective shares are unknown 
during  we obtained updated information regarding currently proposed remediation and our expected share of the remediation for these sites 
as a result  we updated the estimates of our total costs to remediate these sites  which resulted in a net noncash credit of million 
of this amount  the pasco site accounted for a credit of million  and the valleycrest site accounted for a charge of million 
as we are still in the early stages of developing a remediation plan with other potentially responsible parties for the valleycrest site  estimates of total projected costs are difficult to determine 
additionally  since the final potentially responsible parties and their respective shares of the remediation costs have not been determined at this time for either site  uncertainty exists as to what our final share of the total costs may be 
therefore  we could experience increased costs in future periods as the remediation processes progress  although we are unable to estimate the amounts at this time 
income taxes the effective tax rate used to calculate our tax benefit or expense was   and for   and the reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate follows statutory federal income tax rate state and local income taxes change in cash surrender value meals and entertainment change in unrecognized tax benefits adjustment to prior year tax accruals foreign statutory rate differential rate adjustment to deferred taxes deficiencies on equity awards valuation allowance permanent and other items effective tax rate the effective tax rate for was significantly impacted by an adjustment to establish a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets except for million related to the pension liability 
after evaluating all positive and negative evidence regarding the potential realization of our deferred tax assets  we concluded that a valuation allowance is necessary primarily based on cumulative losses in recent years and current year actuarial pension losses 
because of the cumulative losses in recent years  the company is not relying on forecasts of future taxable income to realize any us deferred tax assets

a complete description of our reportable segments is included in item  business 
components of segment operating income production costs of our manufacturing and supply chain shared services functions are accumulated on a customer basis and reported in the applicable business unit s cost of sales 
our business units incur a portion of selling  general and administrative expense directly 
each business unit also receives an allocation of sg a expense as follows each business unit has its own sales regions 
selling expense incurred by each sales region is allocated to other business units based on the percentage of revenue generated for the other business unit 
we use an activity based method to allocate expense associated with our client satisfaction function to business units 
finance  technology  and other corporate general and administrative expenses are allocated based on the business unit s budgeted revenue as a percentage of actual consolidated revenue 
general and administrative expense of our remaining shared services is allocated based on a percentage of actual revenue 
in  we reclassified certain customers between our segments to better align them with the core markets served 
segment information for prior years has been revised from previously reported information to reflect the current presentation 
in addition  we changed the allocation methodology for our finance  technology  and other corporate general and administrative expenses 
previously  these expenses were allocated based on the business unit s actual revenue as a percentage of actual consolidated revenue 
beginning in  these expenses are now allocated based on the business unit s budgeted revenue as a percentage of budgeted consolidated revenue 
variability in the segment s actual revenue or the level of selling or corporate sg a expense to allocate can have a significant impact on segment profitability

healthcare our healthcare segment serves hospitals and other providers of healthcare and related services 
this market is undergoing fundamental change as advancing technologies and the focus on patient safety and cost efficiencies are transforming how patient information is obtained and maintained throughout the patient care process 
these factors  combined with legislative actions in the us  are leading to a shift from printed patient documents and records to electronic medical records  steadily reducing demand for most legacy print products while increasing demands for digital document solutions and safety products 
in  we continued to see the effects of these factors  with declines in legacy print products accelerating as the year progressed 
since reorganizing around our markets in  we have continued to build on our extensive expertise in healthcare and address the needs of our customers in this changing market by focusing on solutions that ease the transition to electronic medical records  enhance patient care and safety  and reduce overall costs 
we have also taken efforts to increase our market share by extending existing solutions to current customers  securing additional gpo agreements  and creating strategic partnerships 
in  we acquired of the ownership interest in dialog medical 
dialog medical provides solutions for managing the patient informed consent process 
we believe this acquisition strengthens and broadens our leadership in the healthcare market  compliments our portfolio of solutions  and enhances our ability to continue to advance our core growth products in the healthcare market 
the following table details the estimated changes in revenue and cost of sales for and changes in product mix did not materially contribute to the changes in either revenue or cost of sales 
revenue change cost of sales change units price acquisition revenue during and  units increased as we continued efforts to retain and expand our customer base by pursuing new opportunities provided by the novation contract secured late in and by expanding sales in core solutions 
however  these increases were more than offset by declines in our administrative and clinical forms due to adoption of digital technologies and lower than expected rates of expansion in label and wristband products 
additionally  of the unit decline in related to the additional week in the decrease in pricing in was primarily the result of an increase in discounts related to new customers acquired as a result of new gpo agreements  as well as other new customers 
the following table provides further insight into the changes in revenue by major categories 
chg chg print labels software services other core legacy we continued executing our go to market strategy by acquiring new customers and expanding our offerings to existing customers in and these efforts produced positive results as print revenue in core communication solutions increased million in and million in however  overall revenue in legacy print products  primarily administrative and clinical forms  declined million in and million in  which more than offset these gains 
these declines were driven by the continued adoption of digital technologies and are expected to continue at accelerated rates in future periods 
labels revenue increased slightly in as we began to see the effects of our focus on developing and expanding core patient identification solutions 
declines in labels in resulted from decreases in legacy labels and lower than expected rates of expansion in core labels and wristbands  due in part to limitations under our gpo agreements 
services declined in and due to declines in legacy print products and the associated services with these products  primarily storage and freight 
although currently only of total revenue  software sales have increased in and as we continue to expand our core solutions in this area 
revenue from our recent acquisition of dialog medical accounted for an increase of approximately million 
cost of sales cost of sales decreased in and primarily due to units from lower sales volume 
material prices increased approximately in and  however  lower production expenses realized from our cost reduction initiatives offset these costs 
operating income operating income was down million in compared with due to lower gross margin on lower sales volume 
the decline was partially offset by lower compensation related selling expenses and lower allocated sg a expenses 
operating income was down million in compared with the decline resulted from lower sales volume and higher sg a costs 
compensation related selling expenses declined substantially in from sales optimization initiatives implemented as a result of our structured cost improvement processes 
however  these savings were offset by planned investments in technology sales and product management costs 
financial services our financial services segment operates in a market where advancing technologies and changing regulatory requirements continue to transform the products and services desired by our customers 
the unstable economic conditions in and particularly impacted financial services customers leading to consolidations within the industry  intense customer focus on cost reductions  and highly competitive conditions 
these factors also led to an increase in the adoption of digital technologies further impacting demand and prices for traditional print products 
during and  we utilized our extensive experience to continue to develop our product portfolio and address the changing needs of this market 
we expanded sales to existing customers in marketing solutions and also began to expand our customer base 
although the economy in general improved in and  economic conditions within this market still remain weak 
combined with cost pressures related to regulatory compliance requirements  financial services institutions continue to struggle which continues to impact this segment 
the following table details the estimated changes in revenue and cost of sales for and revenue change cost of sales change units price mix revenue we saw positive effects from our go to market strategy in and as we increased our customer base slightly and expanded sales to existing customers 
however  we continued to see the effects of weak economic conditions and technology erosion which offset these gains and resulted in unit declines  particularly in in  unit declines were further impacted by the significant erosion in volume with a few customers that occurred during the lack of an extra week in as compared with also resulted in a decline in units 
recently  one of our significant customers announced a major restructuring 
we do not know the exact impact this may have on the segment s financial results  however  we anticipate lower revenue of approximately million from this customer in the following table provides further insight into the changes in revenue by major categories 
chg chg print labels software services other core legacy expansion of sales to existing customers and acquisition of new customers contributed to increases in our core print solutions in and marketing solutions increased approximately million in and million in critical communication solutions also increased million in however  these gains were outpaced by declines in legacy print of approximately million in and million in cost of sales in  costs declined due to units as a result of lower sales volume 
this decline was offset by an increase in price  driven by higher material costs and initial costs associated with newly acquired customers 
these increases offset continued improvements in cost of sales from previously implemented cost reduction initiatives 
as a result  the gross margin percentages declined slightly as compared to in  cost of sales declined primarily due to units on lower sales volume 
the decrease attributable to price was primarily driven by our internal cost reduction initiatives and restructuring plans 
these reductions were partially offset by increased costs related to product mix resulting from our go to market strategy for marketing solutions 
some of these solutions are lower margin products that are primarily outsourced at a higher cost than internally produced products 
as a result  the gross margin percentage in improved only slightly as compared with operating income operating income in was consistent with the decline in gross margin as a result of lower volume was offset by lower allocated sg a expenses 
operating income decreased by million in compared with  due primarily to planned increases in selling and administrative expenses related to business development activities and improvements in our infrastructure during the first half of increased costs were offset somewhat by lower commissions on reduced revenue and cost savings realized from our cost reduction initiatives taken in and commercial markets our commercial markets segment also operates in a market being affected by digital advances 
customer adoption of digital technologies has reduced demand in traditional print products creating excess capacity and increased price competition  while at the same time creating new opportunities for print on demand and digital based products 
additionally  products sold in this segment are heavily weighted toward customer spending on transactional documents  training  advertising  and payroll services 
therefore  a strong correlation exists between the demand for most of our products and the economic conditions within the market and unemployment rates 
a slow economic recovery and high unemployment rates continue to have a negative impact on our customers 
reduced demand has resulted in consolidations and divestitures as a means to control costs and create efficiencies 
during and  economic conditions slowly improved  and we continued to focus on our customers needs and the development of new solutions 
we extended solutions to existing customers and acquired new customers 
however  intense price competition and continued technological erosion in our traditional print products led to revenue declines 
the following table details the estimated changes in revenue and cost of sales for and revenue change cost of sales change units price mix revenue revenue declined in primarily due to lower units 
non repeat orders in marketing solutions  lost revenues from a few large customers  and reduced demand for legacy products drove the declines 
increases in revenue due to price resulted primarily from the pass through of material cost increases 
in  units increased primarily as a result of improved economic conditions and a small expansion in our customer base 
however  this increase was offset by price declines 
intense competition within the industry resulted in higher discounts on new business  as well as with existing customers 
the following table provides further insight into the changes in revenue by major categories 
chg chg print labels software services other core legacy declines in legacy solutions negatively impacted print revenue in and  accounting for declines of approximately million and million 
marketing solutions increased in approximately million but declined million in services declined in primarily due to declines in distribution services associated with unit declines in print products 
cost of sales in  cost of sales decreased overall primarily driven by lower sales volume 
we did experience some higher costs as a result of material cost increases during the year and increased production costs related to newly acquired customers and unabsorbed costs due to lower unit volume 
however  changes in product mix from some lower margin legacy products to higher margin core growth products offset some of the higher costs 
in  cost of sales decreased overall primarily driven by lower production costs of approximately resulting from our workforce reductions and other cost reduction initiatives 
these savings were offset by a shift in product mix from some internally produced products to higher cost outsourced products 
despite the reduction in cost of sales  the gross margin percentage declined in as compared with  as pricing concessions in revenue outpaced the cost savings 
operating income the operating loss for was million higher compared with due to the decline in sales volume and unabsorbed sg a costs 
the operating loss for was million higher than due the decline in sales volume and increased administrative expenses related to planned investments in infrastructure in industrial our industrial segment has experienced growth as we continued to execute our go to market strategy and expand our in mold product line 
our acquisition of selected assets of fusion graphics in and the development of new applications has supported these efforts 
additional growth has been realized as economic conditions in the us have slowly improved from the economic downturn in primary customers for this segment are manufacturers of products directly affected by discretionary spending levels of consumers and products supporting the housing industry 
as a result  as conditions improved  order levels for most of our products increased 
although manufacturing has continued to expand in the us in and is expected to expand in  some industrial segments that we focus on have continued to show slow growth or declines  especially hvac  electrical distribution  and appliances 
the following table details the estimated changes in revenue and cost of sales for and revenue change cost of sales change units price mix revenue revenue increased in and primarily due to units 
growth was driven by increased sales of core solutions  the acquisition of new customers  and expansion of sales to existing customers 
units also increased  particularly in  as economic conditions in manufacturing improved from the downturn in due to slow economic growth and some declines experienced by our hvac  electrical distribution  and appliance customers  revenue increases were lower in as compared to pricing increased in and primarily due to targeted efforts to improve profit margins and the pass through of material price increases 
we expect this trend to continue in the following table provides further insight into the changes in revenue by major categories 
chg chg print labels software services other core legacy increases in print products in and were driven primarily by increases in marketing solutions and critical communications 
these solutions increased approximately million in and million in the increases were partially offset by declines in legacy print products of million in and marketing solutions and critical communications increased due to increased sales efforts around these core solutions as we implemented our go to market strategy 
increases in labels in and were primarily driven by increased sales in printed production parts as a result of the acquisition of new customers and improved economic conditions 
the rate of increase in was lower as economic growth in some of our primary industrial segments weakened as progressed 
sales of our in mold labels continued to increase with the acquisition of new customers  although at lower than anticipated rates 
revenue from in mold labels was million  million  and million in   and cost of sales the increase in cost of sales due to units in and was driven by higher sales volume 
in  costs also increased due to pricing as a result of higher material costs of approximately and higher production costs of 
higher production costs resulted from unabsorbed costs due to lower than anticipated volume in our in mold product line and temporarily higher costs associated with certain customer accounts 
due to the increase in costs  the gross margin percentage declined approximately in as compared with in  volume increases throughout the year improved cost absorption rates  particularly in our in mold product line 
we incurred higher material costs of approximately resulting from supplier price increases during however  we successfully offset these increases with reduced production costs of approximately resulting from our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives 
due to these cost improvements  the gross margin percentage increased from in to in operating income operating income improved from a loss of million in to income of million in as a result of higher sales volume and targeted cost reduction efforts 
improvements in gross margin drove the increase in operating income in although  higher administrative costs and increases in selling expenses during offset some of these gains 
administrative costs increased as part of planned investments in infrastructure and increased costs related to the acquisition of fusion graphics 
selling expenses increased due to planned investments in business development activities associated with implementing our go to market strategy and higher commissions due to the increase in revenue in liquidity and capital resources our discussion of liquidity and capital resources will include an analysis of our cash flows and capital structure 
this discussion also presents financial measures that are considered non gaap 
because our credit facility is borrowed under a revolving credit agreement which currently permits us to borrow and repay at will up to a balance of million subject to limitations related to receivables  inventories  and letters of credit  we take the measure of cash flow performance prior to borrowing or repayment of the credit facility 
in effect  we evaluate cash flow as the change in net debt credit facility less cash and cash equivalents 
cash flows the major elements of the statements of cash flows are summarized below cash inflow outflow net income plus non cash items working capital restructuring payments contributions to qualified pension plan other net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures acquisitions proceeds from sale of property and equipment net cash used in investing activities net change in borrowings under credit facility principal payments on long term debt dividends paid other net cash provided by used in financing activities net effect of exchange rate changes net change in cash memo add back credit facility borrowed cash flow on a net debt basis includes deferred compensation and non qualified pension payments and changes in other non current assets and liabilities 
operating activities restructuring payments were lower in and as we completed previously initiated restructuring plans 
in january  we announced a restructuring program that when fully implemented is expected to result in an estimated million in annual savings 
total costs of the restructuring program are expected to be approximately million  the majority of which will be incurred contributions to the company s qualified pension plan were million  million  and million in   and we have elected to take advantage of the funding relief provisions of the pension relief act of based upon these provisions and current estimates  our minimum funding is estimated to be million in  million in  and million in deferred compensation balances paid to employees and payments of supplementary pension benefits were significantly higher in due to employees retiring and electing lump sum payments of their benefits during that year 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities were primarily driven by capital expenditures in   and in and  we made strategic investments in our infrastructure and product portfolio 
in  our capital spending primarily related to projects with higher returns on invested capital and those required to maintain operations 
in  we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million 
in the last half of  we also entered into several capital lease obligations for digital color equipment and technology 
the new investment supports our strategy for growth in core marketing solutions 
the capital lease obligations provide for aggregate payments  including interest  of approximately million over the next five years 
as part of our go to market strategy to expand our product portfolio  we invested in acquisitions totaling million and million in and in  we acquired of the ownership interest in dialog medical as an addition to our healthcare segment 
we paid approximately million at the time of purchase 
we also signed a note payable for million  which will be paid in two annual installments beginning on the first anniversary date of the agreement 
in addition  in accordance with the contingent consideration arrangement  we will pay two additional annual payments based upon the achievement of certain revenue targets by the acquired business 
the agreement provides for maximum contingent consideration of million 
however  based on current revenue forecasts  we have recorded a liability in the amount of million 
in  we purchased selected assets  primarily patents  of fusion graphics  inc for approximately million 
the purchase represents an important part of transforming our product portfolio specifically related to our in mold product line of our industrial segment 
we expect to continue considering other acquisition opportunities that further expand and improve our product portfolio 
financing activities in and  borrowings increased under our revolving credit facility  driven by lower operating profit  increased contributions to our qualified pension plan  and increases in capital expenditures and acquisitions 
although  savings from our cost reduction initiatives and lower dividend payments allowed us to partially absorb these costs 
dividend payments to shareholders in were consistent with dividend payments in were lower compared with  as our board of directors elected to reduce the quarterly dividend from to per share beginning in the second quarter of this decision was made after giving consideration to the economic environment and the company s strategy  equity position  and capital needs 
in january  we announced the suspension of our quarterly dividend in keeping with ohio law  which requires that cash dividends be paid only out of a corporation s statutory surplus 
because of the decline in shareholder s equity related to actuarial losses in our pension plan and the valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets  there is not currently a statutory surplus 
we have a  four year senior secured revolving credit facility credit facility with five banks that matures in the credit facility is secured by accounts receivable  inventories  fixed assets  and certain other assets 
the credit facility contains a fixed charge coverage covenant test that becomes applicable if the sum of available unborrowed credit plus certain cash balances falls below of aggregate commitments or million  whichever is greater 
the credit facility provides for the payment of interest on amounts borrowed under london interbank offered rate libor contracts and base rate loans 
payment of interest on libor contracts is at an annual rate equal to the libor rate plus to based on our level of liquidity 
payment of interest on base rate loans is based on the prime rate plus to based upon our level of liquidity 
we are also required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility 
such fee is payable at an annual rate of basis points if the unused portion is equal to or less than of the aggregate commitment or basis points if the unused portion is greater than of the aggregate commitment 
at year end  we had million available under the credit facility 
we believe that the combination of internally generated funds  available cash reserves  and our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  including capital expenditures  and investments in growth initiatives over the next year 
we believe our major long term cash requirements consist of investing in our growth initiatives aimed at transforming our product portfolio and our pension funding 
while we have taken steps to enable us to adequately fund these items  actual amounts required may be higher than estimated due to the uncertainty in determining the exact amounts needed
