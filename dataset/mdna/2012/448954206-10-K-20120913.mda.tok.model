item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our corporate mission is to provide energy for the future by exploring for  developing new  and re establishing pre existing sources of energy 
we are currently exploring for oil and gas offshore guinea  which will be our primary focus for the remainder of calendar year we intend to continue acquiring  exploring and developing oil and gas properties 
at this time  we have no source of operating revenue and there is no assurance when we will  if ever 
we have no operating cash flows and require substantial additional funds  through additional participants  securities offerings  or through other means  to fulfill our long term business plans 
our operating plan within the next months includes the following evaluating the data from the sabu exploratory well drilled in our concession offshore guinea during fiscal process and interpret the most recent d seismic survey covering approximately  square kilometers on our contract area 
the new deep water survey acquired during fiscal is adjacent to our survey a  where we acquired our initial  square kilometer d seismic survey in the most recent d survey allows us to study upper cretaceous submarine fan structures along the transform margin trend of guinea in northwest africa 
we seek to sell  or farm out  a interest in the concession to an experienced oil and gas company that would also serve as operator of the project going forward 
the farm out process is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 
table of contents analysis of changes in financial position our current assets decreased by  from  on june  to  on june  the decrease in current assets is due to our fiscal capital expenditures  which lead to a decrease in cash from  at june   to  at june   and a decrease in short term investments from  at june  to zero at june  our long term assets increased  from  on june   to  on june  this increase was primarily due to our drilling activity related to the sabu exploratory well and our  square kilometer d seismic acquisition and processing  partially offset by our full cost ceiling test amortization of  million resulting from the non commercial drilling outcome  as required by full cost accounting rules 
additionally  the increase can be attributed to an increase in long term restricted cash from  at june  to  at june  restricted cash as of june  and consists of cash held in escrow relating to our drilling contract with agr 
under the terms of the drilling contract  we funded the escrow account for the sole purpose of funding our drilling project as overseen by agr 
our current liabilities increased  from  on june  to  on june  accounts payable at june   included amounts payable related primarily to our investments in our concession and corporate activities  whereas accounts payable at june  includes costs associated with the drilling of our first well as well as seismic processing 
additionally  the increase in current liabilities can be attributed in part to an increase in accrued employee bonus expense resulting from the timing of bonus payments and increase in staff 
our long term liabilities decreased from  at june   to  at june   due to the amortization of deferred rent during the year 
results of operations based on the factors discussed below the net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended june   increased  to a net loss of  or per share in the period from a net loss of  or per share in the period  primarily relating to the amortization and write off of costs 
reportable segments we have one reportable segment our international operations in guinea conducted through our subsidiary scs 
scs is engaged in oil and gas exploration activities pertaining to offshore guinea 
results of operations comparison for fiscal year and revenues 
there were no revenues for the years ended june  and depreciation 
depreciation increased  or  due to additional depreciation associated with assets placed in service in which relate primarily to assets put in place to drill our first exploratory well 
depreciation expense was  and  in the years ended june  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this represents an increase of  or  from the fiscal period to the fiscal period 
the increase in expense was primarily attributable to a  increase in employee related costs  of which approximately  was non cash stock based compensation related to options granted to employees and others 
this was driven by an increase in our full time staff from employees as of july  to employees as of june  the staffing increase primarily related to personnel required for our activities in guinea and our support staff 
additionally  we incurred approximately  in costs with respect to several prospective oil and gas investment opportunities in the current fiscal period 

table of contents amortization and write off of costs 
we fully amortized our proved oil and gas properties of  as a result of the non commercial sabu well drilling outcome  as required by full cost accounting rules  we evaluated and moved to proved properties  of costs which were then fully amortized though our full cost ceiling test 
additionally we have written off a prospective investment deposit of  other income expense 
other income expense totaled  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily the result of a loss on the warrant derivative liability in the prior fiscal period 
in the fiscal period  we recognized a non cash loss on the warrant derivative liability of  no such gain or loss was incurred on the warrant derivative liability in fiscal as the remaining warrants underlying the derivative were exercised during the second quarter of fiscal however  we recognized an other than temporary impairment of available for sale securities of  during fiscal loss from continuing operations 
primarily as a result of the full amortization of proved oil and gas properties and the write off of the prospective investment deposit discussed above  which together total  and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  our loss from continuing operations increased by  from  in the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  discontinued operations 
there were no discontinued operations for the or periods 
comparison for fiscal year and revenues 
there were no revenues for the years ended june  and depreciation 
depreciation increased  or  due to additional depreciation associated with assets placed in service in depreciation expense was  and  in the years ended june  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this represents a decrease of  or  loss from operations 
our loss from operations increased  from  in to  in during the period  we recognized a  gain on sale of a participation interest in unevaluated oil and gas properties resulting from the participation interest in our concession being assigned to dana 
this gain was recognized in may and represented the excess of the million proceeds received over the amount of our investment in the concession as of that date 
other income expense 
other income expense totaled  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
in  we recognized a non cash loss on the derivative liability related to the ya global warrants of  all of which related to the exercise of warrants classified as derivative liabilities 
in  we recognized a non cash gain on the derivative liability of   of which was unrealized gain on the change in fair value of the liability and  loss which was related to the exercise of warrants classified as derivative liabilities 
interest income expense was  for the period  versus  for the period 
the higher interest income in was primarily attributable to the interest income on short term investments on hand during the fourth quarter 
the lower interest expense in is primarily due to the early conversion of convertible debentures outstanding during the fiscal period and the expensing of the associated debt discount and we recognized a loss on extinguishment of the remaining convertible debenture balance of  primarily attributable to the expensing of the remaining discount associated with these debentures 

table of contents loss from continuing operations 
based on the items discussed above  our loss from continuing operations increased by  or  from  in the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  discontinued operations 
there were no discontinued operations for the period  while there was a gain of  for the period 
liquidity and capital resources capital resource considerations we completed drilling of our first exploration well  the sabu well in february the cost incurred on the sabu well is million  or approximately million for our interest 
the high cost of the sabu well adversely affected our cash position and liquidity 
on february   we closed the sale of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  of our common shares in a registered direct public offering 
the net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately  the february offering improved our cash position and liquidity  and we have adequate funds to conduct our current operations 
however  our ability to drill additional wells will depend on obtaining additional resources through sales of additional interests in the concession  equity or debt financings  or through other means 
if we farm out additional interests in the concession  our percentage will decrease 
although we have been successful in raising capital and in entering into a key participation arrangement with dana  we have no firm commitments for additional capital resources 
the terms of any such arrangements  if made  are unknown  and may not be advantageous 
in april  we announced the engagement of bank of america merrill lynch as an advisor to assist us in connection with the potential sale of an interest in the concession 
we seek to sell  or farm out  a interest in the concession to an experienced oil and gas company that would also serve as operator of the project going forward 
several companies are reviewing data  and we expect the farm out process to be completed by the end of calendar year liquidity on june   we had  in cash and  in restricted cash  which is held in escrow in connection with our drilling contract with agr 
we had  in liabilities  which are comprised of current liabilities of  and noncurrent liabilities of  we plan to use our existing cash to fund our portion of the remaining expenditures related to the sabu well 
the cost incurred on the sabu well is million  or million for our interest 
we have paid approximately million of the well costs on a gross basis  or approximately million based on our current interest  as of june  as described in legal proceedings  we have filed suit against agr following unsuccessful negotiations to address the cost overruns associated with the sabu well 
payment of the remaining drilling costs is pending resolution of this dispute 
to date  agr has not yet filed its defense in this matter  however  agr has made claims for additional cost of million on a gross basis or million based on our share which we dispute and have excluded from cost incurred to date 
resolution of this dispute may result is the recovery of a portion of the costs incurred to date  however  it is possible that the resolution of this dispute may result in additional liability associated with disputed costs 
additionally  we entered into an agreement for the supply of marine seismic data with cgg veritas 
the cost for acquiring the survey  processing and other services is expected to total approximately million gross  or million based upon our current interest in the guinea concession  of which  we have paid million on a gross basis as of june  or million based upon our share 
we plan to use our existing cash to fund these remaining expenditures 

table of contents after giving effect for the remaining liabilities and excess supplies associated with the sabu well and for the remaining costs associated with the d seismic survey  our cash would be in the range of million 
we are currently involved in various legal proceedings 
we are unable to predict the outcome of such matters  however  an adverse development could have an impact on liquidity 
net cash used in operating activities for continuing operations for the year ended june  was  compared to  for the year ended june  cash used in investing activities for continuing operations for the year ended june  was  compared to  in the year ended june  this decrease was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities in the current year as compared to the purchase of available for sale securities in the prior year 
this was offset by an increase in expenditures associated with the drilling of our first well 
there was net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  of  compared to  during the year ended june  we received approximately  in proceeds from the issuance of stock during fiscal additionally  we received approximately  in proceeds from the exercise of warrants during the prior year period 
this compares to the current period where we received  from the issuance of stock 
contractual commitments and obligations our subsidiary  scs  has  remaining of a contingent note payable due to the former owners of scs corporation s assets 
it is payable in our common stock and it is payable only if scs has net income in any given quarter 
if scs experiences net income in a quarter  of the income will be paid against the note  until the contingency is satisfied 
disclosure of contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years installment obligations operating lease obligations total we are subject to certain commitments under the psc as discussed in item above 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those estimates that may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion of critical accounting policies addresses those policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates 
we base our estimates and judgment on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents oil and gas properties we account for oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting as prescribed by the united states securities and exchange commission sec 
accordingly  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of proved oil and natural gas properties  including the costs of abandoned properties  dry holes  geophysical costs  and annual lease rentals are capitalized 
all selling  general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred 
sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change  or to the extent that the sale proceeds exceed our capitalized costs 
depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on proved reserves 
the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at  net of tax considerations 
in accordance with sec release  prices based on the preceding months average price based on closing prices on the first day of each month  or prices defined by existing contractual arrangements  are used in deriving future net revenues discounted at  net of tax 
the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rates compared to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
costs excluded costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves 
we review our unevaluated properties at the end of each quarter to determine whether the costs incurred should be transferred to the full cost pool and thereby subject to amortization 
we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant 
the assessment includes consideration of the following factors  among others intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  the assignment of proved reserves  and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned 
we assess our unevaluated properties on a country by country basis 
during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment  the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 
however  if proved reserves have not yet been established in a full cost pool  these costs are charged against earnings 
for international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
at june    we had  of capitalized costs associated with our guinea operations  which is net of  in current period amortization as a result of moving costs incurred on previously unevaluated properties to proved properties during the period 
environmental obligations and other contingencies management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation  litigation and other contingent matters 
provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters  including  but not limited to  the stage of investigation  the stage of the remedial design  evaluation of existing remediation technologies  and presently enacted laws and regulations 
in future periods  a number of factors could significantly change our estimate of environmental 
table of contents remediation costs  such as changes in laws and regulations  or changes in their interpretation or administration  revisions to the remedial design  unanticipated construction problems  identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater  and changes in costs of labor  equipment and technology 
consequently  it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from our estimates 
fair value of our debt and equity transactions many of our various debt and equity transactions require us to determine the fair value of a debt or equity instrument in order to properly record the transaction in our financial statements 
fair value is generally determined by applying widely acceptable valuation models  eg  the black scholes and binomial lattice valuation models using the trading price of the underlying instrument or by comparison to instruments with comparable maturities and terms 
share based compensation we follow asc which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award presumptively the vesting period 
asc also requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we account for non employee share based awards based upon the provisions of asc  equity based payments to non employees 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our functional currency is the us dollar 
we have some foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from our in country offices in guinea and the united kingdom 
us dollars are accepted in guinea and many of our purchases and purchase obligations  such as our office lease in guinea  are denominated in us dollars 
however  our costs for labor  supplies  and fuel could increase if the guinea franc or the pound sterling significantly appreciates against the us dollar 
we do not hedge the exposure to currency rate changes 
we do not believe our exposure to market risk to be material
