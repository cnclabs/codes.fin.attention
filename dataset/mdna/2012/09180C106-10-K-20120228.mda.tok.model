item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general as of february  we owned and operated restaurants located in states california  texas  arizona  colorado  oregon  nevada  florida  ohio  oklahoma  kentucky  indiana  louisiana and washington 
each of our restaurants is operated either as a bj s restaurant brewery  a bj s restaurant brewhouse  a bj s pizza grill  or a bj s grill restaurant 
our menu features our award winning  signature deep dish pizza  our own proprietary handcrafted beers as well as a wide selection of appetizers  entrees  pastas  sandwiches  specialty salads  desserts  non alcoholic beverages  wine  other craft beers and spirits 
the first bj s restaurant was opened in orange county  california in as a small full service restaurant focusing on a lighter  bakery crust style deep dish pizza 
we acquired the original bj s restaurants in from their original owners 
our initial public offering of common stock occurred in additionally  in  we opened our first large format restaurant and brewery in brea  california and began to expand the menu to include our own handcrafted beer  appetizers  entrees  pastas  sandwiches  specialty salads and desserts 
of the restaurants we operated as of february   are bj s restaurant brewery restaurants of which three are currently manufacturing our proprietary handcrafted beer for some of our restaurants  are bj s restaurant brewhouse restaurants which are similar to our brewery restaurants except that they do not manufacture beer  seven are bj s pizza grill restaurants which are primarily our original  smaller format legacy restaurants  of which one has an operating brewery and one is bj s grill a smaller format full service restaurant intended to serve as a live research and development restaurant at the current time 
in the near term  our future restaurant growth will focus principally on our bj s restaurant brewhouse format 
however  we may continue to build additional bj s restaurant brewery locations in certain areas where we believe it may be more appropriate to brew our own beer 
we may also consider opening smaller format bj s pizza grill or bj s grill formats as fill in locations in certain densely populated  urban trade areas  or in smaller cities  where a larger format location could not be obtained or is not appropriate 
we also have contract brewing arrangements in which we utilize other qualified craft brewers to produce our proprietary handcrafted beers and sodas under our proprietary recipes and our indirect supervision 
we currently believe that  over the long run  it will become more beneficial to increase our contract brewing due to the economies of scale that can be obtained from brewing beer in large quantities while also avoiding potential liquor licensing complications in some states where we desire to operate 
table of contents restaurants 
as such  we expect to gradually increase our contract brewing relationships over the next several years 
as a result of this expected increase in contract brewing  we intend to rebalance our internal beer production activities on an ongoing basis 
in addition  we may decide to eventually decommission certain additional internally operated breweries  which may result in additional disposals of related assets in the future 
we intend to continue developing and opening new bj s restaurants in high profile locations within densely populated areas in both existing and new markets 
since most of our established restaurants currently operate close to full capacity during the peak demand periods of lunch and dinner  and given our relatively high average sales per productive square foot  we generally do not expect to achieve sustained increases in comparable sales in excess of our annual effective menu price increases for our mature restaurants  assuming we are able to retain our guest traffic levels in those restaurants 
therefore  we currently expect that the majority of our year over year revenue growth for fiscal will be derived from new restaurant openings and the carryover impact of partial year openings during newly opened restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher cost of sales  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs for several months after their opening in both percentage and dollar terms when compared with our more mature  established restaurants 
accordingly  the number and timing of newly opened restaurants has had  and is expected to continue to have  an impact on restaurant opening expenses  cost of sales  labor and occupancy and operating expenses 
additionally  initial restaurant openings in new markets may experience even greater inefficiencies for several months  if not longer  due to lower initial sales volumes  which results from initially low consumer awareness levels  and a lack of supply chain and other operating cost leverage until additional restaurants can be opened in the markets 
our revenues are comprised of food and beverage sales at our restaurants 
revenues from restaurant sales are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale 
revenues from our gift cards are recognized upon redemption in our restaurants 
gift card breakage is recognized as other income on our consolidated statements of income 
gift card breakage is recorded when the likelihood of the redemption of the gift cards becomes remote  which is typically after months from original gift card issuance 
cost of sales is comprised of food and beverage costs 
the components of cost of sales are variable and typically fluctuate directly with sales volumes 
labor and benefit costs include direct hourly and management wages  bonuses and payroll taxes and fringe benefits for restaurant employees including stock based compensation that is directly related to restaurant level team members 
occupancy and operating expenses include restaurant supplies  credit card fees  marketing costs  fixed rent  percentage rent  common area maintenance charges  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related restaurant costs 
general and administrative costs include all corporate  field supervision and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include corporate management  field supervision and corporate hourly staff salaries and related employee benefits including stock based compensation expense  travel and relocation costs  information systems  the cost to recruit and train new restaurant management employees  corporate rent and professional and consulting fees 
depreciation and amortization principally include depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants 
restaurant opening expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist of the costs of hiring and training the initial hourly work force for each new restaurant  travel  the cost of food and supplies used in training  grand opening promotional costs  the cost of the initial stocking of operating supplies and other direct costs related to the opening of a restaurant  including rent during the construction and in restaurant training period 
while we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases  no guarantee can be given that such leases will be renewed or  if renewed  that rents will not increase substantially 
we currently have a lease for one of our smaller format bj s pizza grill restaurants scheduled to expire during the next twelve months 
our plan is to close and relocate this smaller format restaurant to another location in the same general trade area that can accommodate a large format bj s restaurant brewhouse restaurant during fiscal year 
table of contents in calculating comparable company owned restaurant sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable base once it has been open for months 
guest traffic for our restaurants is estimated based on values assigned to certain menu items or individual guest tickets 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  our consolidated statements of income expressed as percentages of total revenues 
fiscal consists of weeks 
all other fiscal years presented consist of weeks 
fiscal year consolidated statements of income data revenues costs and expenses cost of sales labor and benefits occupancy and operating general and administrative depreciation and amortization restaurant opening loss on disposal of assets natural disaster and related legal settlements and terminations total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense gain loss on investment settlement other income  net total other income expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income weeks ended january  fiscal compared to the weeks ended december  fiscal revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase in revenues consisted of an increase of approximately million in sales from new restaurants not yet in our comparable sales base  an approximate million  or  increase in comparable restaurant sales on a week basis  and million of sales due to the rd week 
on a week basis  the increase in comparable restaurant sales resulted from an estimated effective menu price increase factor of approximately  coupled with an estimated benefit from increased guest traffic and an estimated benefit from a favorable menu mix shift and guest purchase incidence rates 
our restaurants  like most in casual dining  are impacted by inflationary pressures for the costs of certain commodities  labor and other operating expenses 
we attempt to offset the impact of inflation on our cost structure with purchasing economies of scale  productivity and efficiency improvements  menu merchandising and menu price increases 
if our guests do not accept our menu price increases  either by reducing their visits to our restaurants or by changing their purchasing patterns at our restaurants  the expected benefit of any menu price increase could be negated and our operating margins could be adversely impacted 
we currently expect our estimated effective menu price increase for fiscal to be in the range on an annualized basis 
however  depending on inflationary pressures  costs for key inputs and general economic conditions for consumer 
table of contents discretionary spending  our actual menu pricing for fiscal may be greater or less than our current expectations 
additionally  to help protect guest traffic and to respond to the actions of our competitors  we may consider the promotion of selective menu offerings or introduce new menu offerings at reduced or lower price points which could have the effect of further reducing any benefit from menu price increases 
as a relatively small casual dining restaurant chain  we do not have the financial resources to match the marketing and advertising spending levels of our larger casual dining competitors 
accordingly  increased marketing and advertising spending by our larger competitors may also adversely impact general levels of guest traffic in our restaurants 
furthermore  we believe that our guest traffic levels  among other items  will also be dependent upon consumer confidence  discretionary consumer spending and other economic conditions including energy prices  commodity inflation and overall employment 
all potential menu price increases must be carefully considered in light of their ultimate acceptability by our restaurant guests 
additionally  other factors outside of our control  such as inclement weather  shifts in the holiday calendar  competitive restaurant intrusions into our trade areas  heavy promotional and discounting activities by our competitors  general economic and competitive conditions and other factors  as described in the risk factors section in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  can impact comparable sales 
as of february   the cost of many food commodities and gasoline were experiencing significant increases in general  both domestically and internationally 
this could result in reduced consumer discretionary income and less restaurant visits in general  as well as increased resistance to menu price increases 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that increases in comparable sales will be achieved as a result of increased menu prices or other factors 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to the opening of new restaurants during fiscal coupled with the impact of the rd week 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales increased slightly to during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this slight percentage increase was primarily due to increased commodity costs which were partially offset by increased revenues from our estimated effective menu price increases  a favorable menu mix shift and efficiencies gained from the rollout of our automated food preparation system that enabled us to reduce food waste 
we do anticipate that cost of sales in our new restaurants will typically be higher during the first several months of operations than in our mature restaurants  as our restaurant management teams become accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing sales volumes at our new restaurants 
accordingly  a comparatively large number of new restaurant openings in any single quarter may significantly impact total cost of sales comparisons for our entire business 
additionally  restaurants opened in new markets may initially experience higher commodity costs than our established restaurants  where we have greater market penetration that generally results in greater purchasing and distribution economies of scale 
we provide our customers a large variety of menu items and  as a result  we are not overly dependent on a single group of commodities 
however  based on current trends and expectations  we believe the overall cost environment for food commodities will likely remain under significant pressure during  primarily due to domestic and worldwide agricultural  supply demand and other macroeconomic factors that are outside of our control 
while we continue to work with our suppliers to control food costs  and while we have taken steps to enter into longer term agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not significantly increase due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
additionally  there are some commodities that we are unable to contract for long periods of time  such as fluid dairy items  fresh seafood and many produce items  or where we have currently chosen not to contract for long periods of time 
there are also certain commodity items  such as certain produce items  in which the contracts principally consist of collar agreements whereby the costs are subject to floors and ceilings 
it is our current intention to attempt to offset our expected commodity cost increases through certain cost savings and productivity efficiency initiatives and menu mix shifts  coupled with selective menu price increases 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be entirely successful in this respect 

table of contents the cost to produce and distribute our proprietary handcrafted beer is included in our cost of sales 
we currently have qualified three contract brewers to produce our high quality handcrafted beer 
during fiscal  we currently anticipate that our qualified contract brewers will produce approximately of our estimated requirement of approximately  barrels of our proprietary handcrafted beer 
our longer term objective is to have large contract brewers produce substantially all of our larger volume beers 
we currently expect to continue to create and brew our smaller volume seasonal and specialty beers  however  we may eventually decide to also move the majority of this production to contract brewers as we continue to grow our restaurant base and therefore increase our demand for our proprietary handcrafted beer 
we believe the larger scale contract brewers have greater economies of scale  stronger quality control systems and more effective  leverageable supply chain relationships than we have as a relatively small restaurant company 
additionally  this allows our brewery department to focus on creating and developing distinctive and unique beer flavors for us as opposed to focusing on the production and logistics of large scale brewing 
as a result  over the next several years  we expect that the production cost of our larger volume proprietary handcrafted beers can be gradually reduced  while simultaneously providing an improvement in the overall consistency of our beer 
however  freight costs from our contract brewing locations will likely absorb a large portion of those production cost savings for a period of time until we can further increase the number of restaurants we operate and negotiate more favorable terms with our transportation vendors 
contract brewers also produce substantially all of our handcrafted soda and cider products  the costs of which are also included in our cost of sales 
labor and benefits 
labor and benefit costs for our restaurants increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to the opening of new restaurants during fiscal coupled with the impact of the rd week 
as a percentage of revenues  labor and benefit costs decreased slightly to during fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
this slight percentage decrease was primarily related to our ability to leverage our fixed and semi fixed labor costs over a higher revenue base as a result of comparable sales increases 
included in labor and benefits for fiscal and was approximately million and million or and of revenues  respectively  of stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock units granted in accordance with our gold standard stock ownership program for certain restaurant management team members 
our restaurants can be affected by increases in federal and state minimum wages  and also by increases in federal and state unemployment insurance taxes 
additionally  some states have annual minimum wage increases correlated with either state or federal increases in the consumer price index 
in the past  we have been able to react to changes in our key operating costs  including minimum wage increases by gradually increasing our menu prices and improving our productivity in our restaurants 
however  we cannot guarantee that all or any future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be accepted by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
for new restaurants  labor expenses will typically be higher than normal during the first several months of operations  if not longer in some cases  until our restaurant management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the sales volumes expected at our new restaurants 
accordingly  a comparatively large number of new restaurant openings in any single quarter may significantly impact labor cost comparisons for the entire company 
occupancy and operating 
occupancy and operating expenses increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to the opening of new restaurants during fiscal coupled with the impact of the rd week 
as a percentage of revenues  occupancy and operating expenses decreased to for fiscal from for the prior fiscal year 
this percentage decrease was principally a result of our ability to leverage the fixed component of these expenses as a result of higher comparable sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal also included in general and 
table of contents administrative costs for fiscal and was million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense 
the increase in general and administrative costs was primarily due to planned higher field supervision and support personnel  coupled with higher levels of recruiting and training costs related to our managers in training program  additional travel and lodging costs to support our new restaurant openings and the impact of the rd week 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal from for the prior fiscal year 
this percentage decrease was due to our ability to leverage the fixed component of these expenses over a higher revenue base 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal depreciation and amortization increased as a result of our construction costs for new restaurants and depreciation on our new operating toolsets  restaurant remodels and initiatives 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization slightly decreased to for fiscal from for the prior fiscal year 
this percentage decrease was principally a result of our ability to leverage the fixed component of these expenses as a result of higher comparable sales 
restaurant opening 
restaurant opening expenses increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal we opened and new restaurants during fiscal and  respectively 
our opening costs will fluctuate from period to period  depending upon  but not limited to  the number of restaurant openings  the size and concept of the restaurants being opened  the location of the restaurants and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process 
see business restaurant opening expenses in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
loss on disposal of assets 
loss on disposal of assets decreased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal these costs were primarily related to the disposal of certain unproductive restaurant assets in connection with our ongoing productivity efficiency initiatives and facility image enhancement activities 
legal settlements 
legal settlements of approximately million or of revenues  during fiscal were primarily related to the proposed settlements of certain california employment practices lawsuits 
we agreed to these settlements  which are subject to court approval  in order to avoid the costs  risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation and to eliminate the further diversion of company management s time and attention  and without admitting any liability on the part of the company 
see part i item legal proceedings of this form k for additional information regarding pending and recently settled legal proceedings 
interest income 
interest income increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to slightly higher interest rates and investment balances compared to last year 
interest expense

gain loss on investment settlement 
gain loss on investment settlement of approximately million during fiscal relates to the settlement agreement reached in december with our former broker dealer for the full liquidation of our auction rate securities investment portfolio 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we are entitled to potential future recoveries of our loss on that portfolio based on the performance of those auction rate securities through december in connection with this settlement  during fiscal certain of these aforementioned securities were redeemed at par  resulting in additional cash recoveries 
other income  net 
net other income consists primarily of gift card breakage income and remained stable at million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal based on an analysis of our gift card program since its inception  we determined that months after issuance date  the likelihood of gift card redemption is remote 

table of contents income tax expense 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal differed from the statutory income tax rate primarily due to additional tax credits 
we currently estimate our effective tax rate to be in the approximate range of for fiscal however  our actual effective tax rate for fiscal may be different than our current estimate due to actual revenues  pre tax income and tax credits achieved during the year and the deductibility of any subsequent disqualified dispositions related to incentive stock options 
weeks ended december  fiscal compared to the weeks ended december  fiscal revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase in revenues consisted of an increase of approximately million in restaurant sales from new restaurants not yet in our comparable sales base  combined with an approximate million  or  increase in comparable restaurant sales 
the increase in comparable restaurant sales resulted from estimated increases in both guest traffic and the average amount spent per guest  which also included an estimated effective menu price increase factor of approximately 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales decreased to during fiscal from for the prior fiscal year

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  a summary of our key liquidity measurements dollar amounts in thousands january  december  cash and cash equivalents total marketable securities net working capital current ratio for the weeks ended for the weeks ended january  december  cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures our fundamental corporate finance philosophy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet in order to support our long term restaurant expansion plan with sufficient financial flexibility  to provide the financial resources necessary to protect and enhance the competitiveness of our restaurant and brewing operations  to provide our restaurant landlords with confidence as to our intent and ability to honor all of our financial obligations under our restaurant leases  and to provide a prudent level of financial capacity to manage the risks and uncertainties of conducting our business operations on a larger scale 
we obtain capital resources from our ongoing operations  employee stock option exercises and tenant improvement allowances from our landlords 
additionally  in the past we have obtained capital resources from public stock offerings 
as an additional source of liquidity  we also have a million credit facility in place that expires on january  our capital requirements are principally related to our restaurant expansion plans and restaurant enhancements and initiatives 
while our ability to achieve our growth plans is dependent on a variety of factors  some of which are outside of our control  our primary growth objective is to achieve an approximate increase in total restaurant operating weeks during fiscal from the development and opening of new restaurants  coupled with the carryover impact of partial year openings and to some extent offset by the impact of the additional operating week in fiscal since fiscal was a week fiscal year 
depending on the expected level of future new restaurant development and expected tenant improvement allowances that we receive from our landlords  as well as our other planned capital investments including ongoing maintenance capital expenditures  our base of established restaurant operations may not yet be large enough to generate enough cash flow from operations to totally fund our planned expansion over the longer run 
accordingly  we will continue to actively monitor overall conditions in the capital markets with respect to the potential sources and timing of additional financing for our planned future expansion 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available when required or available on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to secure additional capital resources  we may be required to reduce our longer term planned rate of expansion 
similar to many restaurant chains  we typically utilize operating lease arrangements principally ground leases for the majority of our restaurant locations 
we believe our operating lease arrangements continue to provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
however  we are not limited to the use of lease arrangements as our only method of opening new restaurants 
while our operating lease obligations are not currently required to be reflected as indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheets  the minimum rents and other related lease obligations  such as common area expenses  under our lease agreements must be satisfied by cash flows from our ongoing operations 
accordingly  our lease arrangements reduce  to some extent  our capacity to utilize funded indebtedness in our capital structure 
in an exposure draft issued in  the financial accounting standards board fasb  together with the international accounting standards board  has proposed a comprehensive set of changes in accounting for leases 
the lease accounting model contemplated by the new standard is a right of use model that assumes that each lease creates an asset the lessee s right to use 
table of contents the leased asset and a liability the future rental payment obligations which should be reflected on a lessee s balance sheet to fairly represent the lease transaction and the lessee s related financial obligations 
all of our restaurant leases and our home office lease are accounted for as operating leases  with no related assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
see critical accounting policies leases in this form k 
changes in these accounting rules or their interpretation  or changes in underlying assumptions  estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 
we also require capital resources to evolve  maintain and to increase the productive capacity of our existing base of restaurants and brewery operations and to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures 
our requirement for working capital is not significant since our restaurant guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or credit cards at the time of the sale 
thus  we are able to sell many of our inventory items before we have to pay our suppliers for such items 
we typically seek to lease our restaurant locations for primary periods of to years under operating lease arrangements 
our rent structures vary from lease to lease  but generally provide for the payment of both minimum and contingent percentage rent based on sales  as well as other expenses related to the leases for example  our pro rata share of common area maintenance  property tax and insurance expenses 
in addition  many of our lease arrangements include the opportunity to secure tenant improvement allowances to partially offset the cost of developing and opening the related restaurants 
generally  landlords recover the cost of such allowances from increased minimum rents 
we currently expect to secure approximately million of committed tenant improvement allowances from our planned new restaurant openings during fiscal however  in light of current conditions in the credit and real estate development markets  there can be no assurance that such allowances will continue to be available to us 
from time to time  we may also decide to purchase the underlying land for a new restaurant if that is the only way to secure a highly desirable site 
currently  we own the land that underlies four of our current restaurants and we currently own the land for one restaurant that is expected to be opened in fiscal we disburse cash for certain site related work  buildings  leasehold improvements  furnishings  fixtures and equipment to build out our leased and owned premises 
we own substantially all of the equipment  furniture and trade fixtures in our restaurants and currently plan to do so in the future 
our cash flows from operating activities  as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows  provided million of net cash from operations during the weeks ended january   representing a million increase from the million provided by during the week period of the increase in cash from operating activities for the weeks ended january   in comparison to weeks ended december   is primarily due to the increase in net income and higher depreciation expense as a result of more restaurants in operation 
for the weeks ended january   total capital expenditures were approximately million  of which expenditures for the acquisition of restaurant and brewery equipment and leasehold improvements to construct new restaurants were million 
these expenditures were primarily related to the construction of our new restaurants that opened during the weeks ended january   as well as expenditures related to one additional restaurant expected to open in the first quarter of fiscal  plus the purchase of one parcel of real estate for a new restaurant expected to open in fiscal in addition  total capital expenditures related to the maintenance and key productivity initiatives of existing restaurants and expenditures for restaurant and corporate systems were million and million  respectively 
we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the us securities and exchange commission sec on january  with respect to various types of securities not to exceed an aggregate value of million 
we do not have any immediate intentions or commitments to sell securities and will be required to file a post effective amendment or file a new registration statement in the event we desire to publicly sell securities 
the terms of any future offering of securities would be established at the time of such offering subject to market conditions 
in addition  the form s also included the registration of  shares of common stock previously acquired by certain shareholders from the company in various transactions several years ago 
we registered those shares to fulfill our contractual obligations under a registration rights agreement with those shareholders 

table of contents in we maintained a million unsecured revolving line of credit with a major financial institution the line of credit which was scheduled to expire on september  as of january   there were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit and there were outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million 
any borrowings under the line of credit will bore interest at the financial institution s prime rate or at libor plus a percentage not to exceed based on a lease adjusted leverage ratio as defined in the line of credit agreement 
the line of credit agreement also required compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio  a lease adjusted leverage ratio and certain non financial covenants 
at january   we were in compliance with these covenants 
any interest on the line of credit was payable quarterly and all related borrowings were required to be repaid on or before september  on february   we entered into a new million unsecured revolving line of credit new line of credit with that same financial institution  which replaces our existing line of credit 
the new line of credit expires on january   and may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we expect to utilize the new line of credit principally for letters of credit that are required to support certain of our self insurance programs and for working capital and construction requirements as needed 
the terms of the new line of credit are substantially similar to the prior line of credit 
however  any borrowings under the new line of credit will bear interest at either libor plus a percentage not to exceed  or at a rate ranging from the financial institution s prime rate to below the financial institution s prime rate based on a lease adjusted leverage ratio as defined in the line of credit agreement 
the new line of credit agreement also requires compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio  a lease adjusted leverage ratio and certain non financial covenants 
while we have the new line of credit in place and it can be currently drawn upon  it is possible that creditors could place limitations or restrictions on the ability of borrowers in general to draw on existing credit facilities 
at this time  however  we have no indication that any such limitations or restrictions are likely to occur 
our capital expenditures during fiscal will continue to be significant as we currently plan to open as many as new restaurants including one relocation of an existing restaurant during the year  in addition to our necessary maintenance and key initiative related capital expenditures 
as of february   we have entered into seven signed leases for new restaurant locations expected to open in fiscal additionally we expect to enter into several more leases during fiscal we currently anticipate our total capital expenditure for fiscal  including all expenditure categories and net of expected tenant improvement allowances we may receive from landlords  will be approximately million to million 
we expect to fund our expected capital expenditures for fiscal with current cash and investment balances on hand  expected cash flow from operations and expected tenant improvement allowances of approximately million 
our future cash requirements will depend on many factors  including the pace of our expansion  conditions in the retail property development market  construction costs  the nature of the specific sites selected for new restaurants  and the nature of the specific leases and associated tenant improvement allowances available  if any  as negotiated with landlords 
we significantly depend on our expected cash flow from operations  coupled with agreed upon landlord tenant improvement allowances  to fund the majority of our planned capital expenditures for and if our business does not generate enough cash flow from operations as expected  or if our landlords are unable to honor their agreements with us  and replacement funding sources are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our credit facility or other alternatives  we may not be able to expand our operations at the pace currently planned 
as of february   we had an uncollected outstanding tenant improvement allowance from one landlord in the amount of million for one of our restaurants which opened in fiscal our lease with that landlord allows us to offset or reduce our rent payable in the event that our tenant improvement allowances cannot be collected 
we do not believe that this matter will have a material impact on our overall liquidity  and we are currently seeking the legal enforcement of all of our rights under the lease as we concurrently attempt to negotiate a final settlement of this matter 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities including money market funds  treasury bills  agency bonds  municipal and bank securities and domestic corporate obligations totaled approximately million  as of january  we currently believe that our expected cash flow from operations  cash and investment balances on hand  agreed upon tenant improvement allowances and our new million credit facility  should be sufficient  in the 
table of contents aggregate  to finance our planned capital expenditures and other operating activities through the next months 
our base of established restaurant operations may not yet be large enough to sufficiently generate enough cash flow from operations to totally fund our planned expansion depending on the rate over the long run 
accordingly  we will continue to actively monitor overall conditions in the capital markets with respect to the potential sources and timing of additional financing for our planned future expansion 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available when required or available on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to secure additional capital resources  we may be required to reduce our longer term planned rate of expansion 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow limited purposes 
as of january   we are not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of inflation our profitability is dependent  among other things  on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources  including food and other raw materials  labor  energy and other supplies and services 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our restaurant guests 
while we have taken steps to enter into agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
we are currently unable to contract for certain commodities  such as fluid dairy  fresh seafood and most fresh produce items  for long periods of time 
consequently  such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations 
the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect the profitability of our restaurant operations 
many of our restaurant team members are paid hourly rates related to the federal or state minimum wage 
in addition  numerous state and local governments have their own minimum wage requirements that are generally greater than the federal minimum wage and are subjected to annual increases based on changes in their local consumer price indices 
additionally  a general shortage in the availability of qualified restaurant management and hourly workers in certain geographical areas in which we operate has caused related increases in the costs of recruiting and compensating such team members 
certain operating and other costs  such as health benefits  taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase with the general level of inflation and may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
while we have been able to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
from time to time  competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility 
in addition  macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer discretionary spending for food away from home could make additional menu price increases imprudent 
there can be no assurance that all of our future cost increases can be offset by higher menu prices  or that higher menu prices will be accepted by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
many of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
seasonality and adverse weather our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
our results of operations have historically been impacted by seasonality  which directly impacts tourism at our coastal california locations 
the summer months june through august have traditionally been higher volume periods than other periods of the year 
additionally  our restaurants in the midwest and eastern states  including florida will be impacted by weather and other seasonal 
table of contents factors that typically impact other restaurant operations in those regions 
holidays and shifts in the holiday calendar  severe winter weather  hurricanes  tornados  thunderstorms and similar conditions may impact restaurant sales volumes seasonally in some of the markets where we operate 
many of our restaurants are located in or near shopping centers and malls that typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated restaurant opening expenses 
as a result of these and other factors  our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management and are important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
fair value of marketable securities and cash equivalents we measure the fair value of our marketable securities using quoted market prices in active markets 
all of our marketable securities are currently classified as held to maturity  included as short term and long term marketable securities in the consolidated balance sheets and reported at amortized cost with related gains and losses reflected in earnings once realized in accordance with us gaap 
we believe that the fair value of our marketable securities equaled the quoted market price of our marketable securities at january  we believe the carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short term nature of those instruments 
property and equipment we record all property and equipment at cost 
property and equipment accounting requires estimates of the useful lives for the assets for depreciation purposes and selection of depreciation methods 
we believe the useful lives reflect the actual economic life of the underlying assets 
we have elected to use the straight line method of depreciation over the estimated useful life of an asset or the primary lease term of the respective lease  whichever is shorter 
renewals and betterments that materially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized while maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred 
judgment is often required in the decision to distinguish between an asset which qualifies for capitalization versus an expenditure which is for maintenance and repairs 
when property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of  the asset account and related accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts are relieved  and any gain or loss is included in earnings 
additionally  any interest capitalized for new restaurant construction would be included in property and equipment  net on the consolidated balance sheets 
impairment of long lived assets we assess potential impairments of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
the assets are generally reviewed for impairment in total as well as on a restaurant by restaurant basis 
factors considered include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance by the restaurant relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the recoverability is assessed in most cases by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future restaurant cash flows and estimated useful lives  which are subject to a significant degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets or for the entire restaurant 

table of contents self insurance liability we are self insured for a portion of our general liability insurance and our employee workers compensation programs 
we maintain coverage with a third party insurer to limit our total exposure for these programs 
the accrued liability associated with these programs are based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr claims as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liability is based on information provided by our insurance broker and a third party actuary  combined with our judgments regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  our claims development history  case jurisdiction  related legislation  and our claims settlement practice 
significant judgment is required to estimate ibnr claims as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be significantly impacted 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
our estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
we usually file our income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
we file our tax returns with the advice and compilation of tax consultants 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretation of the tax laws 
deferred tax accounting requires that we evaluate net deferred tax assets to determine if these assets will more likely than not be realized in the foreseeable future 
this test requires projection of our taxable income into future years to determine if there will be taxable income sufficient to realize the tax assets future tax deductions and fica tax credit carryforwards 
the preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws 
the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our consolidated financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
as of january   unrecognized tax benefits recorded was approximately million 
leases we lease the majority of our restaurant locations 
we account for our leases in accordance with us gaap  which require that our leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases 
we disburse cash for leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures and equipment to build out and equip our leased premises 
tenant improvement allowance incentives may be available to partially offset the cost of developing and opening the related restaurants  pursuant to agreed upon terms in our leases 
tenant improvement allowances can take the form of cash payments upon the opening of the related restaurants  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us or a combination thereof 
all tenant improvement allowances received by us are recorded as a deferred rent obligation and amortized over the term of the lease 
the related cash received from the landlord is reflected as landlord contribution for tenant improvements  net within financing activities of our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we obtain possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
we expense rent from possession date through restaurant open date as preopening expense 
once a restaurant opens for business  we record straight line rent over the lease term plus contingent rent to the extent it exceeded the minimum rent obligation per the lease agreement 
there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period  which begins on the possession date and ends on the restaurant open date  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
factors that 
table of contents may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period and lesser occupancy expense during the rest of the lease term post opening 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon our possession of the premises  and record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as a lease obligation 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rentals 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred  in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 
this results in some variability in occupancy expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in restaurants where we pay contingent rent 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
in an exposure draft issued in  the fasb  together with the international accounting standards board  has proposed a comprehensive set of changes in accounting for leases 
while the exposure draft addresses new financial accounting rules for both lessors and lessees  the primary focus will likely be on changes affecting lessees 
the lease accounting model contemplated by the new standard is a right of use model that assumes that each lease creates an asset the lessee s right to use the leased asset and a liability the future rental payment obligations which should be reflected on a lessee s balance sheet to fairly represent the lease transaction and the lessee s related financial obligations 
currently  all of our restaurant leases and our home office lease are accounted for as operating leases  with no related assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
the fasb has reopened the exposure draft for comments and has therefore not identified a proposed effective date for the issuance of the final standard 
changes in these accounting rules or their interpretation  or changes in underlying assumptions  estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 
see item a  risk factors  future changes in financial accounting standards may significantly change our reported results of operations in this annual report on form k 
stock based compensation we have two stock based compensation plans the equity incentive plan and the stock option plan under which we may issue shares of our common stock to employees  officers  directors and consultants 
upon effectiveness of the equity incentive plan  the stock option plan was closed for purposes of new grants 
both of these plans have been approved by our shareholders 
under the equity incentive plan  we have granted incentive stock options  non qualified stock options  and restricted stock units 
stock options generally vest at per year or cliff vest  either ratably in years three through five or in year five  and expire ten years from date of grant 
we account for these plans in accordance with us gaap under the fair value recognition provisions  using the modified prospective transition method 
compensation expense recognized in fiscal and include a compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the revised provisions under us gaap 
we are required to make certain assumptions and judgments regarding the grant date fair value 
these judgments include expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected option life  dividend yield and vesting percentage 
these estimations and judgments are determined by us using many different variables that  in many cases  are outside of our control 
the changes in these variables or trends  including stock price volatility and risk free interest rate  may significantly impact the grant date fair value resulting in a significant impact to our financial results 
the cash flow tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits are required to be classified as financing cash flows 

table of contents impact of recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu  to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and earlier adoption is permitted 
we have early adopted asu for the year ended january  and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations as of january   including estimated cash payments due by period in thousands 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years contractual obligations operating leases purchase obligations total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit long term debt obligations total for more detailed description of our operating leases  refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
amounts represent non cancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and other services 
additionally  we have entered into lease agreements related to future restaurants and our home office lease extension with commencement dates subsequent to january  our aggregate future commitment relating to these leases is million and is not included in operating leases above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of market risks contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from the following discussion based on general conditions in the financial and commodity markets 
our market risk exposures are related to cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term marketable securities with maturities of two years or less as of the date of purchase 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our marketable securities and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
for the weeks ended january   the average interest rate earned on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was approximately 
as of january   our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market funds  treasury bills  agency bonds  municipal and bank securities and domestic corporate obligations with a cost or fair value of approximately million 
cash may be in excess of fdic insurance limits 
the majority of our marketable securities  both short term and long term  are aaa rated and directly or indirectly guaranteed by the us government 
we believe we are not exposed to significant risk on 
table of contents cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the fair market value of our marketable securities is subject to interest rate risk and would decline in value if market interest rates increased 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels existing as of january   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations based upon market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control  whether contracted for or not 
to manage this risk in part  we attempt to enter into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for some of our commodity requirements 
however  it may not be possible for us to enter into fixed price contracts for certain commodities or we may choose not to enter into fixed price contracts for certain commodities 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
we believe that substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
we also believe that we have some flexibility and ability to increase certain menu prices  or vary certain menu items offered  in response to food commodity price increases 
some of our commodity purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  since our purchase arrangements with suppliers  to the extent that we can enter into such arrangements  help control the ultimate cost that we pay
