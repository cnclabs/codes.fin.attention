overview we are a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative treatments for diabetes that may be safer  more effective and more convenient for patients 
we develop our product candidates by applying our proprietary formulation technologies to existing drugs in order to improve their therapeutic profiles 
our most advanced program involves developing proprietary formulations of injectable recombinant human insulin  or rhi  designed to be more rapid acting than the rapid acting mealtime insulin analogs currently used to treat patients with type and type diabetes 
we  therefore  refer to these formulations as our ultra rapid acting insulin formulations 
in addition to our rhi based formulations  we are using our formulation technologies to develop new ultra rapid acting formulations of insulin analogs 
these insulin analog based formulations generally use the same or similar excipients as our rhi based formulations and are designed to be more rapid acting than the rapid acting mealtime insulin analogs  but they may present characteristics that are different from those offered by our rhi based formulations 
we are also developing liquid glucagon formulations for use as a rescue treatment for diabetes patients experiencing severe hypoglycemia 
an earlier rhi based formulation known as linjeta tm and previously referred to as viaject was the subject of a new drug application  or nda  that we submitted to the fda in december in october  the fda issued a complete response letter stating that the nda for linjeta tm could not be approved in its submitted form and that we should conduct two new phase clinical trials using our preferred commercial formulation of linjeta tm prior to re submitting the nda 
based upon the complete response letter and subsequent feedback that the fda provided to us at a meeting in january  we decided to study newer rhi based formulations in earlier stage clinical trials 
the objective of these clinical trials was to identify an rhi based formulation with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles similar to the linjeta tm formulation  but with improved injection site toleration characteristics 
these earlier stage clinical trials evaluated the pharmacokinetic  pharmacodynamic and injection site toleration profiles of our product candidates relative to humalog  a rapid acting insulin analog 
in september  we announced that two newer formulations  biod and biod  did not demonstrate our target profile in phase clinical trials 
we subsequently conducted a phase clinical trial of two additional formulations  biod and biod  and announced top line results from that trial in april both biod and biod achieved our target pharmacokinetic  pharmacodynamic and toleration profiles 
based on our assessment of these two formulations  we selected biod as our lead rhi based product candidate  and in the third calendar quarter of  we began enrolling patients in a phase clinical trial of biod this phase clinical trial is designed to assess the clinical impact of biod relative to humalog 
the trial is being conducted at investigative centers in the united states and is expected to enroll approximately randomized patients with type diabetes 
we expect to announce top line results from this phase clinical trial in the third calendar quarter of in may  we selected two insulin analog based formulations  biod and biod  to evaluate in a phase clinical trial 
biod and biod generally use the same or similar excipients as biod and are intended to be optimized for rapid absorption and injection site toleration 
we began enrolling patients in the phase clinical trial in the third calendar quarter of this trial  which is being conducted in australia  is designed to compare the pharmacokinetic and injection site toleration profiles of these formulations relative to a rapid acting mealtime insulin analog 
we expect to announce top line results from this clinical trial in the first calendar quarter of in parallel with the phase clinical trial of biod and biod  we are continuing our formulation development work to improve the stability characteristics of our ultra rapid acting insulin analog based formulations 
in addition to our ultra rapid acting insulin formulation program  we are developing a liquid glucagon formulation for use as a rescue treatment for diabetes patients experiencing severe hypoglycemia  or very low concentrations of blood glucose 
to date  we have not selected a lead formulation to advance into clinical trials 
we are continuing to conduct preclinical testing to develop formulations that achieve a combination of pharmacokinetic  pharmacodynamic and stability characteristics that we believe would be required for a glucagon rescue treatment product to be commercially successful 
we are a development stage company 
we were incorporated in december and commenced active operations in january to date  we have generated no revenues and have incurred significant losses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses as we continue our efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
we have financed our operations and internal growth through various financing transactions  including our initial public offering in may and several subsequent transactions  including  most recently  our june private placement 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development activities  including clinical trials 
our net loss was million for the year ended september  as of september   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
research and development and general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net loss applicable to common stockholders  represent approximately and  respectively  of the expenses that we have incurred since our inception 
as of september   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million in cash and cash equivalents as of september  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures at least until the second calendar quarter of we believe that future cash expenditures will be partially offset by raising additional capital from research grants  capital markets  proceeds derived from collaborations  including  but not limited to  upfront fees  research and development funding  milestone payments and royalties 
we can give no assurances that such funding will  in fact  be realized in the time frames we expect  or at all 
we may be required to secure alternative financing arrangements or defer or limit some or all of our research  development or clinical projects 
financial operations overview revenues to date  we have generated no revenues 
we do not expect to begin generating any revenues unless any of our product candidates receive marketing approval  or if we receive payments in connection with strategic collaborations that we may enter into for the commercialization of our product candidates 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of the costs associated with our basic research activities  as well as the costs associated with our drug development efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings 
our research and development expenses consist of external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party contract research organizations and investigative sites  third party manufacturing organizations and consultants  employee related expenses  which include salaries and benefits for the personnel involved in our preclinical and clinical drug development and manufacturing activities  and facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
we intend to focus our research and development efforts on conducting preclinical studies and phase and phase clinical trials to determine our preferred development  clinical and regulatory program for our ultra rapid acting insulin formulations and our liquid glucagon formulations 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses for the fiscal year ending september  will increase as compared to the fiscal year ended september   as we continue to study biod in a phase clinical trial  study our ultra rapid acting insulin analog based formulations in early stage clinical trials and conduct additional formulation development work to improve the stability  pharmacokinetic  and pharmacodynamic properties of our ultra rapid acting insulin analog based formulations  and conduct the development work necessary to select a lead formulation for our liquid glucagon rescue product candidate and commence clinical trials of that formulation 
over the longer term  we anticipate that these expenses will increase further as we conduct later stage clinical trials of our ultra rapid acting insulin formulations and a liquid glucagon formulation  including one or more pivotal clinical trials required for fda approval of ndas for these product candidates  and purchase active pharmaceutical ingredients and other materials to support our research and development activities 
we have used our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research projects and our drug development programs for our ultra rapid acting insulin formulations  including biod  biod and biod  and our liquid glucagon formulations 
to date  we have not tracked expenses related to our product development activities on a project or program basis 
accordingly  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of research and development expenses that we incurred with respect to each of our clinical and preclinical product candidates 
however  substantially all of our research and development expenses incurred to date are attributable to our ultra rapid acting insulin program 
in july and september  we received two national institutes of health nih awards for the development of concentrated ultra rapid acting insulin formulation and glucagon formulation for use in an artificial pancreas 
the july award is intended to fund research to develop a proprietary ultra rapid insulin product candidate at high concentrations suited to provide sufficient quantities of insulin in an external artificial pancreas pump device that has limited volume capacity 
the july award is for two years and totals thousand 
the september award is intended to fund research to develop a proprietary glucagon product candidate optimized to algorithmically deliver glucagon as part of a bihormonal closed loop system to mitigate hypoglycemic events 
the september award is for two years and totals thousand 
the following table illustrates  for each period presented  our research and development costs by nature of the cost 
year ended september  december  inception to september  in thousands research and development expenses preclinical expenses manufacturing expenses clinical regulatory expenses total the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  specific timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from our product candidates 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of our ability to complete our phase clinical trial of biod in a timely manner and the outcome of that trial  the success of our formulation development work to improve the stability  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of our ultra rapid acting insulin analog based formulations  our ability to conduct the development work necessary to select a lead formulation for our liquid glucagon product candidate for the rescue treatment of severe hypoglycemia and commence clinical trials of that formulation  the results of our real time stability programs for our insulin and glucagon product candidates  including the reproducibility of earlier  smaller scale  stability studies and our ability to accurately project real time stability on the basis of accelerated testing  our ability to accurately anticipate technical challenges that we may face in the development of a glucagon rescue product candidate  our ability to secure approval by the fda for our product candidates under section b of the ffdca  our ability to conduct pivotal clinical trials and other tests or analyses required by the fda to secure approval to commercialize an ultra rapid acting insulin formulation or a liquid glucagon formulation  our ability to enter into collaboration arrangements for the commercialization of our product candidates and the success or failure of any such collaborations into which we enter  or our ability to commercialize our product candidates ourselves  our ability to enforce our patents for our product candidates and our ability to secure additional patents for our product candidates  our ability to protect our intellectual property and operate our business without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  the degree of clinical utility of our product candidates  particularly with regard to our ultra rapid acting insulin formulations  which have not yet been shown to be clinically superior to existing rapid acting insulin analogs  the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments  such as advancements in glucagon stabilization technologies that could enable a room temperature rescue product in a portable  easy to use presentation  the ability of our major suppliers to produce our products in our final dosage form  our commercialization  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategies  and our ability to accurately estimate anticipated operating losses  future revenues  capital requirements and our needs for additional financing 
a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of ultra rapid acting insulin formulations or our liquid glucagon formulation  could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with product development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  including stock based compensation expenses  in our executive  legal  accounting  finance and information technology functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense  travel expenses  costs associated with industry conventions and professional fees  such as legal and accounting fees and consulting costs 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year ending september  will remain substantially the same as in the fiscal year ended september  as we continue to focus our efforts on product formulation activities and earlier stage clinical trials 
over the longer term  however  these expenses could increase if we are successful in advancing our product candidates into later stage clinical trials  including phase pivotal trials 
warrant liability in june  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share in connection with our june private placement 
these warrants will expire on june   five years from the original issuance date of june  in may  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share in connection with our may registered direct offering 
these warrants will expire on may   five years from the original issuance date of may  under the terms of both the warrants and the warrants  if we enter into a merger or change of control transaction  the holders of the warrants will be entitled to receive consideration as if they had exercised the warrants immediately prior to such transaction  or they may require us to purchase the unexercised warrants at the black scholes value as defined in the applicable warrant of the warrant on the date of such transaction 
the holders have up to days following any such transaction to exercise this right 
as a result of this provision  we recognize the and warrants as liabilities at their fair value on each reporting date 
we use the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of the warrants 
the black scholes valuation model takes into account  as of the valuation date  factors including the current exercise price  the expected life of the warrant  the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility  expected dividends on the stock  and the risk free interest rate for the term of the warrant 
using this model  we recorded an initial warrant liability of million for the warrants and million for the warrants  in each case as of the initial warrant issuance date 
the significant assumptions for the model used for the warrants were remaining terms of the warrants  the common stock price of per share  the warrant exercise price of per share  a risk free interest rate of and an expected volatility rate of 
the significant assumptions for the model used for the warrants were remaining terms of the warrants  the common stock price of per share  the warrant exercise price of per share  a risk free interest rate of and an expected volatility rate of 
the liability for both the and warrants is revalued at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recognized currently in the statements of operations under the caption adjustment to fair value of common stock warrant liability 
in august  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock in connection with our august registered direct offering 
on december   the unexercised warrants to purchase  shares of common stock expired 
we revalued the liability from september  through the date of expiration and there was no impact on the statement of operations 
the common stock warrant liability associated with these warrants no longer exists 
in addition to the and warrants  as of june   we had outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 
these warrants expired unexercised in july interest income interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
in november  our board of directors approved investment policy guidelines  the primary objectives of which are the preservation of capital  the maintenance of liquidity and maintenance of appropriate fiduciary control subject to our business objectives and tax situation 
we have maintained an investment strategy of investing primarily in a premier commercial money market account  which consists primarily of short term debt securities issued by the us government  treasury securities and us government agencies 
we intend to maintain this conservative strategy in fiscal year critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies  which we have discussed with our audit committee  are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals in preparing our financial statements  we must estimate accrued expenses pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions  clinical research organizations and contract manufacturers that conduct and manage preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacture product for these trials on our behalf 
this process involves communicating with relevant personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for services when we have not yet been invoiced for or otherwise notified of the actual cost 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
the financial terms of these agreements vary and may result in uneven payment flows 
to date  we have not adjusted our estimates at any balance sheet date in any material amount 
examples of preclinical study  clinical trial and manufacturing expenses include the following fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 
government grants grants received are recognized as grant income when the grants become receivable  provided there is reasonable assurance that we will comply with the conditions attached to the grant and there is reasonable assurance the grant will be received 
we request cash funding under approved grants as expenses are incurred not in advance and report these receipts on the statement of operations as a separate line item entitled government grants 
the corresponding expenses are included in research and development expenses 
in july and september  we were awarded two national institutes of health grants for the development of concentrated ultra rapid acting insulin formulations and liquid glucagon formulations  respectively  for use in an artificial pancreas 
both awards are for two years and total approximately thousand each 
work on the grant for the development of concentrated ultra rapid acting insulin formulation started in august and expenses incurred were thousand during the twelve months ended september  and corresponding income and a receivable were recorded 
share based compensation stock incentive plan in march  our shareholders approved our stock incentive plan  which we refer to as the plan 
up to  shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the plan  plus  shares of common stock underlying already outstanding awards under our prior plans 
in addition  on march   our stockholders approved an amendment to the plan to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the plan solely for the purpose of allowing us to issue an aggregate of  rsus to certain of our employees in place of discretionary cash bonuses in connection with the fiscal year ended september  the contractual life of options granted under the plan may not exceed seven years 
the plan uses a fungible share concept under which any awards that are not a full value award will be counted against the share limit as one share for each share of common stock and any award that is a full value award will be counted against the share limit as shares for each one share of common stock 
we have not made any new awards under any prior equity plans after march  the effective date the plan was approved by our stockholders 
we will continue to use the black scholes pricing model to assist in the calculation of fair value 
the expected life for these grants was calculated in accordance with the simplified method described in the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab topic d in accordance with sab no 
the simplified method was chosen due to our limited history 
until we have adequate history  we will continue to utilize the simplified method 
we recognize compensation costs related to share based transactions  including employee stock options  in the financial statements based on fair value 
the fair value of the stock underlying the options is a significant factor in determining credits or charges to operations appropriate for the share based payments to both employees and non employees 
we selected the black scholes valuation model as the most appropriate valuation method for stock option grants to employees  members of our board of directors and non employees 
the fair value of these stock option grants is estimated as of their date of grant using the black scholes valuation model 
because we lack sufficient company specific historical and implied volatility information  we based our estimate of expected volatility on the median historical volatility of a group of publicly traded companies that we believe are comparable to us based on the criteria set forth in asc topic c and sab topic d  particularly line of business  stage of development  size and financial leverage 
we will continue to consistently apply this process using the same companies or  if those companies become no longer comparable  other appropriately comparable companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our share price becomes available 
however  we will regularly review these comparable companies  and may substitute more appropriate companies if facts and circumstances warrant a change 
we use the simplified method that uses the average of the weighted average vesting period and the contractual life of the option  seven years  to determine the estimated term of the option 
the risk free rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the stock option is based on the yield of a us treasury strip on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award 
we estimate forfeitures based on actual forfeitures during our limited history 
additionally  we have assumed that dividends will not be paid 
for options granted to non employees and non directors  primarily consultants who served on our scientific advisory board  we measure fair value of the equity instruments utilizing the black scholes valuation model  if that value is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the consideration or service received 
the fair value of these equity investments were periodically revalued as the options were vesting and were recognized as expense over the related period of service or the vesting period  whichever was longer 
we have not granted options to non employees and non directors since the year ending september  prior to september   we issued to these non employees options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
all of these options are currently vested 
for the years ended september   and  the share based compensation expense income related to these options was million  million and  respectively 
we grant rsus to executive officers and employees pursuant to the plan  from time to time 
each rsu represents one share of common stock 
there is no direct cost to the recipients of rsus  except for any applicable taxes 
except as set forth below with regard to rsus awarded to employees in place of discretionary cash bonuses  each award vests in installments on each anniversary of the date of grant  and the costs of the awards are determined as the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant 
in all cases  costs are expensed per the vesting schedule outlined in the award 
for example  rsus awarded in december vest annually over three years  with vesting on the first anniversary of the date of grant and the remainder vesting in two equal installments on each anniversary thereafter  and therefore are expensed in the first year and each year in the next two years 
except as set forth below with regard to rsus awarded to employees in place of discretionary cash bonuses  each year following the annual vesting date  between january st and march th  we will issue common stock for each vested rsu 
during the period when the rsu is vested but not distributed  the rsus cannot be transferred and the grantee has no voting rights 
if we declare a dividend  rsu recipients will receive payment based upon the percentage of rsus that have vested prior to the date of declaration 
in march  we granted rsus to our employees in place of the discretionary cash bonuses that were established in connection with the fiscal year ended september  the cost of these awards was determined to be the value of the discretionary cash bonuses 
these rsus vested  and the underlying shares were distributed  on september  at that time  the value of the discretionary cash bonuses exceeded the fair market value of the corresponding rsus 
for the year ended september   the share based compensation expense  including expenses associated with stock options and rsus  was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   the share based compensation expense  including expenses associated with stock options and rsus  was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   the share based compensation expense was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
at september  and  we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset of approximately million and million  respectively  as our management believes it is uncertain that it will be fully realized 
if we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which we make such a determination 
as of september   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for us federal and million for state tax purposes 
these loss carry forwards expire between and to the extent these net operating loss carry forwards are available  we intend to use them to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations 
section of the us internal revenue code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carry forwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership 
we updated the section analysis  performed in fiscal year  to incorporate the registered direct offering that we completed in may as of september   we performed a preliminary section analysis in connection with the registered direct offering that we completed in august and believed that an ownership change had occurred 
we updated this analysis to take into account the registered direct offering that we completed in may based on this further review  we determined that an ownership change under section occurred on may  we believe that approximately million of the million federal losses will expire unused as a result of section limitations 
the maximum annual limitation under section is approximately million for years 
as of september   we have determined that ownership change  under section  occurred as a result of the june financing and  therefore  the ability to utilize our current nols is further limited 
to the extent our use of net operating loss carry forwards is limited  future income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carry forwards  which could result in decreased net income 
we also have state research and development credit carry forwards of approximately million  which expire commencing in fiscal results of operations year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenue 
we did not recognize any revenue during the years ended september  or research and development expenses 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts research and development percentage of net loss research and development expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease was primarily attributable to reductions of million in manufacturing expenses and million in regulatory expenses 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase of million in clinical expenses related primarily to our phase clinical trial of biod and biod and a net increase of million in research and development expenses related to an increase in the number of preclinical animal studies we conducted and a licensing fee paid to aegis 
the reductions in manufacturing expenses are attributable to savings of million as a result of renegotiating the terms of our supply agreement for rhi and million in reduced personnel costs 
the million reduction in regulatory expenses resulted from lower professional fees for the year ended september   as compared to  and lower stock based compensation costs 
the research and development expenses for the twelve months ended september  were reduced by our receipt in january of million in research grants under the internal revenue services therapeutic tax credit program and were increased by a million severance charge resulting from the retirement of our former chief scientific officer 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  include million in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to employees 
we did not record any stock based compensation expense for the year ended september  for options granted to non employees 
in july and september  we received two national institutes of health nih awards for the development of concentrated ultra rapid acting insulin formulation and glucagon formulation for use in an artificial pancreas 
the july award is intended to fund research to develop a proprietary ultra rapid insulin product candidate at high concentrations suited to provide sufficient quantities of insulin in an external artificial pancreas pump device that has limited volume capacity 
the july award is for two years and totals thousand 
the september award is intended to fund research to develop a proprietary glucagon product candidate optimized to algorithmically deliver glucagon as part of a bihormonal closed loop system to mitigate hypoglycemic events 
the september award is for two years and totals thousand 
for the quarter ended september   we reported thousand in government grants for the high concentration ultra rapid insulin product candidate and did not start the glucagon formulation work 
general and administrative expenses 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts general and administrative percentage of net loss general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease is attributable to reductions of million in depreciation expense due primarily to fully depreciating our accounting software  million in employee and non employee director stock based compensation expenses  and other expenses of million 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  include million in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to employees and non employee directors 
interest and other income 
year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts interest and other income percentage of net loss interest and other income increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase resulted primarily from interest on the higher cash balances generated by our june private placement 
interest expense 
for the years ended september  and  we had no interest expense 
adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability percentage of net loss change in warrant valuation 
year ended september  net change warrant august may june total the change in fair value of derivative instruments warrants of  during the year ended september  was primarily a result of the decrease in the price of the common stock from per share at september  to per share at september  the change in fair value of derivative instruments warrants of  during the year ended september  was a result of the increase in the price of the common stock from per share at september  to per share at september  net loss and net loss per share 
year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts net loss net loss per share net loss was million  or per share  for the year ended september   compared to million  or per share  for the year ended september  the increase in net loss was primarily due to an increase in adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability  as noted above 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenue 
we did not recognize any revenue during the years ended september  or research and development expenses 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts research and development percentage of net loss research and development expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease was primarily attributable to reductions of million in clinical expenses  million in manufacturing and device development expenses and million in regulatory expenses 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase of million in expenses related to our discovery activities as we increased our preclinical studies in the year ended september  research and development expenses for the year ended september  were reduced by our receipt in january of million in research grants under the internal revenue service s therapeutic tax credit program and were increased by a million severance charge resulting from the retirement of our former chief scientific officer 
the reductions in clinical expenses reflect reduced expenses of million because we conducted two phase clinical trials during the year ended september   as compared to two month safety extension trials  two tolerability studies and a pump study during the year ended september  in addition  the reductions in clinical expenses reflect reduced professional fees of million and reduced personnel costs of million as a result of our implementation of cost saving initiatives 
the reductions in manufacturing and device development expenses are attributable to savings of million as a result of renegotiating the terms of our recombinant human insulin supply agreement  the completion of our insulin pen development in the year ended september   which resulted in expenses of million that did not recur in the year ended september   and reduced personnel and professional costs of million 
the million reduction in regulatory expenses resulted from lower professional fees in the year ended september  as compared to because the year ended september  included the filing of our nda and a day update with the fda 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  include million in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to employees 
we also recorded a credit of thousand in stock based compensation income for the year ended september  for options granted to non employees  which we must revalue for accounting purposes each reporting period 
general and administrative expenses 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts general and administrative percentage of net loss general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease is attributable to a decrease of million in professional fees  million in personnel and employee stock based compensation expenses  million in non employee director stock based compensation expense and other expenses of million 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  include million in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to employees and non employee directors 
we also recorded a credit of thousand in stock based compensation income for the year ended september  for options granted to non employees  which we must revalue for accounting purposes each reporting period 
interest and other income 
year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts interest and other income percentage of net loss interest and other income increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase resulted primarily from interest on the higher cash balances generated by our may financing and by moving our cash to a premium money market fund which eliminated investment fees and yielded a higher return 
interest expense 
for the years ended september  and  we had no interest expense 
adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability 
year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability percentage of net loss adjustments to fair value of common stock warrant liability decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the september  adjustment to fair value of common stock warrant liability of million is comprised of decreases in the value of the may and august warrants of million and million  respectively 
the decrease from the prior year was primarily attributable to the closing price of our common stock on september  of per share being lower than the september  closing price of our common stock of per share  for the august warrants  and the may  closing price of our common stock of for the may warrants 
we use the black scholes valuation method to calculate the fair value for the may warrants and the monte carlo simulation method for the august warrants 
as a result  the fair value for the may and august warrant liability decreased 
the august warrants expired on december  the may warrants will be revalued each reporting period

we plan to continue to invest our cash and cash equivalents in accordance with our approved investment policy guidelines

in december  the exercise price of the warrants was reset to per share and in may  the exercise price of the warrants was reset to per share 
in august  warrants for a total of  shares were exercised and we received proceeds of approximately thousand 
the remaining warrants for  shares expired unexercised on december  funding requirements we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures at least until the second calendar quarter of we have based this estimate upon assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
our existing capital resources are not sufficient to complete our clinical development program for an ultra rapid acting insulin product candidate or a liquid glucagon formulation 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  and to the extent that we may or may not enter into collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current anticipated clinical trials 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress  timing or success of our research and development and clinical programs for our product candidates  including the resulting data from clinical trials of an ultra rapid acting insulin formulation or a liquid glucagon formulation  our ability to complete our phase clinical trial of biod in a timely manner and the outcome of that trial  the success of our formulation development work to improve the stability  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of our ultra rapid acting insulin analog based formulations  our ability to conduct the formulation development work necessary to select a commercial candidate formulation for our glucagon rescue product for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia and commence clinical trials of that formulation  the results of our real time stability programs for our insulin and glucagon product candidates  including the reproducibility of earlier  smaller scale  stability studies and our ability to accurately project real time stability on the basis of accelerated testing  our ability to accurately anticipate technical challenges that we may face in the development of a glucagon rescue product candidate  our ability to secure approval by the fda for our product candidates under section b of the ffdca  our ability to conduct pivotal clinical trials and other tests or analyses required by the fda to secure approval to commercialize an ultra rapid acting insulin formulation or a liquid glucagon formulation  our ability to enter into collaboration arrangements for the commercialization of our product candidates and the success or failure of any such collaborations into which we enter  or our ability to commercialize our product candidates ourselves  our ability to enforce our patents for our product candidates and our ability to secure additional patents for our product candidates  our ability to protect our intellectual property and operate our business without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  the degree of clinical utility of our product candidates  particularly with regard to our ultra rapid acting insulin formulations  which have not yet been shown to be clinically superior to existing rapid acting insulin analogs  the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments  such as advancements in glucagon stabilization technologies that could enable a room temperature rescue product in a portable  easy to use presentation  the ability of our major suppliers to produce our products in our final dosage form  our commercialization  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategies  and our ability to accurately estimate anticipated operating losses  future revenues  capital requirements and our needs for additional financing 
we do not anticipate generating product revenue for the next few years 
in the absence of additional funding  we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in our cash used in operations over the next several years 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not currently have any commitments for future external funding 
we may receive additional proceeds from the exercise of the warrants that we issued in connection with our may registered direct offering and our june private placement  if any of those warrants are exercised for cash 
whether the warrants are exercised for cash will depend on decisions made by the warrant holders and on whether the market price of our common stock exceeds the per share warrant exercise price of the may warrants or the per share warrant exercise price of the june warrants 
the may warrants and the june warrants will expire on may  and june   respectively 
we have implemented cost saving initiatives to reduce operating expenses  including reducing the number of employees  and we continue to seek additional areas for cost reductions 
however  we will also need to raise additional funds and periodically explore sources of equity or debt financing 
we may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity financings  partnerships  joint ventures  debt financings  bank borrowings or other sources 
however  additional funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing shareholders may result 
if we fail to obtain additional capital when needed  we may be required to delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
adopted accounting pronouncements comprehensive income in june  the fasb  issued asu presentation of comprehensive income  or asu asu allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
while asu changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
in december  the fasb issued asu comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 or asu asu deferred certain aspects of asu pertaining only to the presentation of reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income and reinstates the previous requirements to present reclassification adjustments either on the face of the statement in which other comprehensive income is reported or to disclose them in a note to the financial statements 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we adopted this guidance in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended september  the adoption of asu and the deferrals in asu had no impact on our consolidated financial statements
