quarter high low dividends declared per share high low dividends declared per share quarter ended march quarter ended june quarter ended september quarter ended december our dividend policy our board of directors has targeted a cash dividend payout ratio of approximately to of annual non gaap net income  subject to growth initiatives and other funding needs 
we use non gaap measures  discussed in further detail in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation non gaap net income in part ii of this annual report  to assess the strength of the underlying operations of the business 
we believe non gaap measures provide information to better analyze our operations between periods  and over time 
we are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of membership interests in our operating company 
as a result  we depend upon distributions from our operating company to pay any dividends that our board of directors may declare to be paid to our class a common stockholders  if any 
when and if our board of directors declares any such dividends  we then cause our operating company to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to cover the dividends declared 
we may not pay dividends to our class a common stockholders in amounts that have been paid to them in the past  or at all  if  among other things  we do not have the cash necessary to pay our intended dividends  or any of our financing facilities or other agreements restrict us from doing so 
to the extent we do not have cash on hand sufficient to pay dividends in the future  we may decide not to pay dividends 
by paying cash dividends rather than investing that cash in our future growth  we risk slowing the pace of our growth  or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or unanticipated capital expenditures  should the need arise 
our ability to pay dividends is subject to board of director discretion and may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of delaware law

we function as the sole managing member of our operating company  pzena investment management  llc the operating company

we believe that these accounting adjustments add a measure of non operational complexity which partially obscures the underlying performance of our business 
in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations  we also review certain non gaap measures of earnings  which exclude these items

we use these non gaap measures to assess the strength of the underlying operations of the business

our advisory fee income is recognized over the period in which investment management services are provided 
following the preferred method identified in the revenue recognition topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc  income from performance fees is recorded at the conclusion of the contractual performance period  when all contingencies are resolved 
our advisory fees are primarily driven by the level of our aum 
our aum increases or decreases with the net inflows or outflows of funds into our various investment strategies and with the investment performance thereof 
in order to increase our aum and expand our business  we must develop and market investment strategies that suit the investment needs of our target clients  and provide attractive returns over the long term 
the value and composition of our aum  and our ability to continue to attract clients  will depend on a variety of factors including  among other things our ability to educate our target clients about our classic value investment strategies and provide them with exceptional client service  the relative investment performance of our investment strategies  as compared to competing products and market indices  competitive conditions in the investment management and broader financial services sectors  general economic conditions  
table of contents investor sentiment and confidence  and our decision to close strategies when we deem it to be in the best interests of our clients 
for our institutional accounts  we are paid fees according to a schedule  which varies by investment strategy 
the substantial majority of these accounts pay us management fees pursuant to a schedule in which the rate we earn on the aum declines as the amount of aum increases 
pursuant to our sub investment advisory agreements with our retail clients  we are generally paid a management fee according to a schedule in which the rate we earn on the aum declines as the amount of aum increases 
certain of these funds pay us fixed rate management fees 
due to the substantially larger account size of certain of these accounts  the average advisory fees we earn on them  as a percentage of aum  are lower than the advisory fees we earn on our institutional accounts 
certain of our clients pay us fees according to the performance of their accounts relative to certain agreed upon benchmarks  which results in a lower base fee  but allows us to earn higher fees if the relevant investment strategy outperforms the agreed upon benchmark 
the majority of advisory fees we earn on institutional accounts is based on the value of our aum at a specific date on a quarterly basis  either in arrears or advance 
advisory fees on certain of our institutional accounts  and with respect to all of our retail accounts  are calculated based on the average of the monthly or daily market value 
advisory fees are also generally adjusted for any cash flows into or out of a portfolio  where the cash flow represents greater than of the value of the portfolio 
while a specific group of accounts may use the same fee rate  the method used to calculate the fee according to the fee rate schedule may differ as described above 
our advisory fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors  including the following changes in aum due to appreciation or depreciation of our investment portfolios  and the levels of the contribution and withdrawal of assets by new and existing clients  distribution of aum among our investment strategies  which have differing fee schedules  distribution of aum between institutional accounts and retail accounts  for which we generally earn lower overall advisory fees  and the level of our performance with respect to accounts on which we are paid performance fees 
expenses our expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits expense  as well as general and administrative expense 
these expenses may fluctuate due to a number of factors  including the following variations in the level of total compensation expense due to  among other things  bonuses  awards of equity to our employees and members of our operating company  changes in our employee count and mix  and competitive factors  and expenses  such as rent  professional service fees and data related costs  incurred  as necessary  to run our business 
compensation and benefits expense our largest expense is compensation and benefits  which includes the salaries  bonuses  equity based compensation  and related benefits and payroll costs attributable to our members and employees 
compensation and benefits packages are benchmarked against relevant industry and geographic peer groups in order to attract and retain qualified personnel 
pursuant to the pzena investment management  llc amended and restated equity incentive plan the equity incentive plan  we have issued restricted units and options to purchase units in our operating company 
we use a fair value method in recording the compensation expense associated with the granting of these restricted units  and options to purchase units  to new and existing members under the equity incentive plan 
under this method  compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the 
table of contents estimated fair value of the award and is recognized over the award s vesting period 
the fair value of the units is determined by reference to the market price of our class a common stock on the date of grant  since these units are exchangeable for shares of our class a common stock on a one for one basis 
we determined that the total grant date fair values of the units granted in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
for each of the years ended   and  we recognized approximately million  million and million  respectively  in compensation and benefits expense associated with the amortization of all restricted operating company class b units 
under the pzena investment management  inc equity incentive plan the equity incentive plan  we have issued options to acquire shares of our class a common stock 
the fair value of the options to purchase class b units and class a common stock is determined by using an appropriate option pricing model on the grant date 
we determined that the total grant date fair values of all options awarded in   and  were million  million  and million  respectively  using the black scholes option pricing model 
for each of the years ended december    and  we recognized approximately million in compensation and benefits expense associated with the amortization of all unvested options to acquire operating company class b units and unvested options to acquire class a common stock issued under the and equity incentive plans 
pursuant to the pzena investment management  llc amended and restated bonus plan the bonus plan  eligible employees whose cash compensation is in excess of certain thresholds have a portion of that excess mandatorily deferred 
these deferred amounts may be invested  at the employee s discretion  in certain third party mutual funds  restricted phantom units of our operating company  or money market funds 
amounts deferred in any calendar year reduce that year s cash compensation expense and are amortized ratably over a four year period commencing the following year 
for the years ended december    and approximately million  million  and million  respectively  in such compensation was deferred 
at december  and  the liability associated with deferred compensation investment accounts was approximately million and million  respectively  and is recorded as deferred compensation liability on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized approximately million  million and million  respectively  in compensation and benefits expense associated with the amortization of all deferred compensation awards 
should additional amounts be deferred in future years  we would expect the non cash portion of our compensation expense to increase as the previously and subsequently deferred amounts are amortized through the statement of operations 
as of december   we had approximately million in total unrecorded compensation expense related to unvested operating company phantom units issued pursuant to our bonus plan  operating company unit and option grants issued under the equity incentive plan  and option grants issued under our equity incentive plan 
we expect that the amortization of these amounts will be approximately million in  million in  and million in for the year ended december   we awarded million in delayed vesting cash awards issued to certain members 
these delayed vesting cash awards have varying vesting schedules  with million to be paid in and the remaining million to be paid in for the year ended december   we awarded million in delayed vesting cash awards  of which million was paid during  with the remaining million to be paid in in  we recognized approximately million in charges related to certain employee departures 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense includes office rent and other expenses  professional and outside services fees  depreciation  and the costs associated with operating and maintaining our research  trading  and portfolio accounting systems 
our occupancy related costs and professional services expenses  in particular  generally increase or decrease in relative proportion to the overall size and scale of our business operations 
we incur additional expenses associated with being a public company for  among other things  director and officer insurance  director fees  sec reporting and compliance including sarbanes oxley and dodd frank 
table of contents compliance  professional fees  transfer agent fees  and other similar expenses 
these additional expenses have and will continue to reduce our net income 
other income expense other income expense is derived primarily from investment income or loss arising from our consolidated subsidiaries  our investments in various private investment vehicles that we employ to incubate new strategies  income or loss generated by our investments in third party mutual funds  interest expense on our outstanding debt prior to its repayment  mark to market movements on our swap agreement prior to its termination  and interest income generated on our cash balances 
other income expense is also affected by changes in our estimates of the liability due to our selling and converting shareholders associated with payments owed to them under the tax receivable agreement which was executed in connection with our reorganization and offering on october  as discussed further below under tax receivable agreement  this liability represents of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state  and local income tax that we realize as a result of the amortization of the increases in tax basis generated from our acquisitions of our operating company s units from our selling and converting shareholders 
amounts waived by our selling and converting shareholders  if any  reduce this liability 
we expect the interest and investment components of other income expense  in the aggregate  to fluctuate based on market conditions and the performance of our consolidated investment partnerships and other investments 
non controlling interests our operating company has historically consolidated the results of operations of the private investment partnerships over which we exercise a controlling influence 
we are the sole managing member of our operating company and control its business and affairs and  therefore  consolidate its financial results with ours 
in light of our employees and outside investors interest in our operating company  we have reflected their membership interests as a non controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  our income is generated by our economic interest in our operating company s net income 
as of december   the holders of class a common stock through the company and the holders of class b units of the operating company held approximately and  respectively  of the economic interests in the operations of the business 
income tax expense benefit as a c corporation under the internal revenue code  we are liable for federal  state and local taxes on the income derived from our economic interest in the operating company  which is net of its provision for new york city unincorporated business taxes  or ubt 
correspondingly  in our consolidated financial statements  we report both the operating company s provision for ubt  as well as our provision for federal  state and local corporate taxes 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
as of december  and  our valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with our acquisition of operating company units in conjunction with the offering and subsequent exchanges was million and million  respectively 
operating results assets under management and flows as of december   our approximately billion of aum was invested in a variety of value oriented investment strategies  representing distinct capitalization segments of us and us equity markets 
the performance of our five largest investment strategies as of december  is further described below 
we follow the same investment process for each of these strategies 
our investment strategies are distinguished by the market capitalization ranges from which we select securities for their portfolios  which we refer to as each strategy s investment universe  as well as the regions in which we invest 
while our investment process includes ongoing review of companies in the investment universes described below  our actual investments may include companies outside of the relevant market capitalization range at the

at december   institutional accounts represented of our total aum  compared to at december   and at december  at december   our non us value and global value investment strategies accounted for of our aum  compared to at december   and at december  our revenues are correlated with the levels of our weighted average aum 
our weighted average aum fluctuates based on changes in the market value of accounts advised and managed by us  and on our fund flows 
since we are long term fundamental investors  we believe that our investment strategies yield the most benefits  and are best evaluated  over a long term timeframe 
we believe that our investment strategies are generally evaluated by our clients and our potential future clients based on their relative performance since inception  and the previous one year  three year  and five year periods 
there has typically been a correlation between our strategies investment performance and the size and direction of asset flows over the long term 
to the extent that our returns for these periods outperform client benchmarks  we would generally anticipate increased asset flows over the long term 
correspondingly  negative returns relative to client benchmarks could cause existing clients to reduce their exposure to our products  and hinder new client acquisition 
given the increase in our performance fees and higher weighted average aum in compared to  our revenues for the year ended december  increased from our revenues for the year ended december  our revenues similarly increased from the year ended december  to the year ended december  an increase in weighted average aum and in revenues typically results in higher operating income and net income 
on the contrary  a decrease in weighted average aum and in revenues typically results in lower operating income  net income  and operating margins 
we would expect pressure on our operating margins in the future if average aum and revenues were to decline 
for the year ended december   our operating expense increased from its comparable period  due to one time charges associated with the sublease of excess real estate  one time charges associated with certain employee departures  and increases in discretionary bonus accruals 
for the year ended december   our operating expense increased from its comparable period  due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense  resulting from increases in employee headcount and discretionary bonus accruals

weighted average assets in retail accounts decreased billion  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december   and had weighted average fees of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in weighted average fees in retail accounts was due to the full year effect of the expiration of the john hancock classic value fund voluntary partial fee waiver  as noted below  and a higher mix of assets in our retail emerging markets strategy  which carries a higher fee rate 
the timing of asset flows in our other retail accounts also contributed to the change in our retail weighted average fee rate 
year ended december  versus december  our total revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this change was driven primarily by increases in weighted average aum  which increased billion  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december  our weighted average fees were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease was due in part to the full year effect of the large institutional inflows in our eafe diversified value and global diversified value strategies that were launched in late we typically offer reduced fee rates to initial clients in our new product offerings

the change in net income attributable to non controlling interests reflects primarily the increase in our weighted average aum  which had a corresponding positive impact on operating company revenues and income 
this increase was offset by the deconsolidation of several investment partnerships at december  and during the year ended december   and a decline in our employees and outside investors ownership interests in the operating company 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources historically  the working capital needs of our business have primarily been met through the cash generated by our operations 
distributions to members of our operating company and loan amortization payments have been our largest use of cash from financing activities 
investing activities have historically been investments in our own investment strategies  purchases and sales of investments to fund our deferred compensation program  and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents was million  inclusive of million in cash held by our consolidated subsidiaries 
advisory fees receivable was million 
we also had approximately million in investments set aside to satisfy our obligations under our deferred compensation program 
we expect to fund the liquidity needs of our business in the next twelve months  and over the long term  primarily through cash generated from operations 
as an investment management firm  our business has been materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world 
our liquidity is highly dependent on the revenue and income from our operations  which is directly related to our levels of aum 
for the year ended december   our weighted average aum and revenues increased by and  respectively  compared to our weighted average aum and revenues for the year ended december  in determining the sufficiency of liquidity and capital resources to fund our business  we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including  among other things  cash  working capital  investments  long term liabilities  lease commitments  debt obligations  and operating company distributions 
compensation is our largest expense 
to the extent we deem necessary and appropriate to run our business  recognizing the need to retain our key personnel  we have the ability to change the absolute levels of our compensation packages  as well as change the mix of their cash and non cash components 
historically  we have not tied our level of compensation directly to revenue  as many wall street firms do 
correspondingly  there is not a linear relationship between our compensation and the revenues we generate 
this generally has the effect of increasing operating margins in periods of increased revenues  but can reduce operating margins when revenue declines 
we continuously evaluate our staffing requirements and compensation levels with reference to our own liquidity position and external peer benchmarking data 
the result of this review directly influences management s recommendations to our board of directors with respect to such staffing and compensation levels 
we anticipate that tax allocations and dividend equivalent payments to the members of our operating company  which consisted of of our employees  certain unaffiliated persons  former employees  and us  will continue to be a material financing activity 
cash distributions to operating company members for partnership tax allocations would increase should the taxable income of the operating company increase 
dividend equivalent payments will depend on our dividend policy and the discretion of our board of directors  as discussed below 
as further discussed below  our operating company was a party to a credit agreement the credit agreement associated with our bank term loan 
among other things  certain amendments to the credit agreement precluded us from paying dividends to shareholders  as did one of the provisions of the senior subordinated notes  further discussed below 
during the year ended december   we terminated our credit agreement 
on december   the restriction on the payment of dividends contained in the notes was waived  and during the year ended december   we repaid the full principal amount of the senior subordinated notes 
we do not anticipate that the termination of the revolving credit facility  originally obtained in conjunction with the credit agreement  will have a material effect on our liquidity position  as no amounts were drawn against it over the course of its existence 
we currently do not have any material need for cash in excess of that derived from our operations 
although we are comfortable with our current capital structure  in the current economic environment  it is uncertain whether additional or alternative sources of debt or equity financing would be available on acceptable terms  if required 

table of contents we do not anticipate meaningful outlays for internal investment or capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
we believe that our lack of long term debt  and ability to vary cash compensation levels  have provided us with an appropriate degree of flexibility in providing for our liquidity needs 
dividend policy we are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of membership interests in our operating company 
as a result  we depend upon distributions from our operating company to pay any dividends that our board of directors may declare to be paid to our class a common stockholders 
when  and if  our board of directors declares any such dividends  we then cause our operating company to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to cover the dividends declared 
our dividend policy has certain risks and limitations  particularly with respect to liquidity 
we may not pay dividends to our class a common shareholders in amounts that have been paid to them in the past  or at all  if  among other things  we do not have the cash necessary to pay our intended dividends 
to the extent we do not have cash on hand sufficient to pay dividends in the future  we may decide not to pay dividends 
by paying cash dividends rather than investing that cash in our future growth  we risk slowing the pace of our growth  or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or unanticipated capital expenditures  should the need arise 
on an annual basis  our board of directors has targeted a cash dividend payout ratio of approximately to of our non gaap net income  subject to growth initiatives and other funding needs 
our ability to pay dividends is subject to the board of directors discretion and may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of delaware law 
see item a risk factors our ability to pay dividends is subject to board discretion and may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of delaware law 
credit agreement and senior subordinated notes during the year ended december   we repaid the remaining principal amount outstanding under our bank term loan and terminated the related credit agreement 
concurrent with the termination of this bank term loan and the credit agreement  the security interest previously granted in our accounts receivable was released 
during the year ended december   we repaid the remaining principal amount outstanding of the senior subordinated notes 
tax receivable agreement our purchase of membership units of our operating company concurrent with our initial public offering  and the subsequent and future exchanges by holders of class b units of our operating company for shares of our class a common stock pursuant to the exchange rights provided for in the operating company s operating agreement  has resulted in  and is expected to continue to result in  increases in our share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of our operating company at the time of our acquisition and these subsequent and future exchanges  which will increase the tax depreciation and amortization deductions that otherwise would not have been available to us 
these increases in tax basis and tax depreciation and amortization deductions have reduced  and are expected to continue to reduce  the amount of cash taxes that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future 
we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the current members of our operating company  the one member of our operating company immediately prior to our initial public offering who sold all of its membership units to us in connection with our initial public offering  and any future holders of class b units  that requires us to pay them of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax that we actually realize or are deemed to realize in the case of an early termination payment by us  or a change in control  as described in the tax receivable agreement as a result of the increases in tax basis described above and certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement  including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement 
in october  the selling shareholders agreed to a two year waiver of any payments that we were required to make to them for the and tax years pursuant to the tax receivable agreement 

table of contents cash flows operating activities provided million and million in cash flows for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the year over year increase in cash flows from operating activities was driven primarily by changes in working capital  in addition to an increase in net income  exclusive of the effects of the one time charges in operating expense in and adjustments related to our tax receivable agreement and the associated liability to selling and converting shareholders 
operating activities provided million and million in cash flows for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the year over year increase in cash flows from operating activities was driven primarily by an increase in weighted average aum  from billion for the year ended december   to billion for the year ended december   which had a corresponding positive impact on total revenues and profits 
investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures  mutual fund contributions to  and redemptions from  our deferred compensation program  and related party activity 
for the years ended december    and  investing activities used million  million  and less than million  respectively 
the decrease of million in cash used in investing activities from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to an increase of million in proceeds from investments in our deferred compensation plan and a decrease of million in purchases of investments in our deferred compensation plan  offset by an increase of million in purchases of property and equipment 
the increase of million in cash used in investing activities from less than million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to an increase of in investments in our deferred compensation plan 
financing activities consist primarily of borrowing arrangements and contributions from  and distributions to  non controlling interests  which represent tax allocations and dividend equivalents paid to the members of the operating company  as well as withdrawals made by our consolidated investment partnerships 
financing activities used million for the year ended december   and used million for the year ended december  the million decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to the million repayment of our senior subordinated notes in that was not replicated in  a decrease of million in distributions to non controlling interests  and a decrease of million in dividend payments  offset by a decrease of million in contributions from non controlling interests 
the decrease in distributions to non controlling interests and dividend payments was primarily attributable to the timing of dividend declarations 
financing activities used million for the year ended december   and used million for the year ended december  the million decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to an million reduction in principal repayment associated with our debt obligations  and a million increase in contributions from non controlling interests  offset by an increase of million in distributions to non controlling interests  and an increase of million in dividend payments

payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease expenses  net of sublease rental income  total     off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements 
a thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial condition 
management believes that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used 
consolidation our policy is to consolidate all majority owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest and variable interest entities of which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
we also consolidate non variable interest entities which we control as the general partner or managing member 
we assess our consolidation practices regularly  as circumstances dictate 
all significant inter company transactions and balances have been eliminated 
investments in private investment partnerships in which we have a minority interest and exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method 
such investments  if any  are reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition as investments in affiliates and are recorded at the amount of capital reported by the respective private investment partnerships 
such capital accounts reflect the contributions paid to  distributions received from  and the equity earnings of  the private investment partnerships 
income taxes we are a c corporation under the internal revenue code  and thus liable for federal  state and local taxes on the income derived from our economic interest in our operating company 
the operating company is a limited liability company that has elected to be treated as a partnership for tax purposes 
our operating company has not made a provision for federal or state income taxes because it is the responsibility of each of the operating company s members including us to separately report their proportionate share of the operating company s taxable income or loss 
similarly  the income of our consolidated investment partnerships is not subject to income taxes  as such income is allocated to each partnership s individual partners 
the operating company has made a provision for new york city unincorporated business tax ubt 

table of contents we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
a valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to go unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
determining the valuation allowance requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions 
in determining the valuation allowance  we use historical and forecasted future operating results  based upon approved business plans  including a review of the eligible carryforward periods  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
each quarter  we re evaluate our estimate related to the valuation allowance  including our assumptions about future taxable income 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to the million valuation allowance  recorded against the deferred tax asset associated with our acquisition of operating company membership units  is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period 
for example  tax law changes  or variances in future projected operating performance  could result in a change in the valuation allowance 
if we are not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  evaluating our tax positions and establishing deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to earnings would result 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as investment adviser for the institutional separate accounts we manage and the retail clients for which we act as sub investment adviser 
as noted in item a  risk factors  we experienced declines in aum during the first quarter of and the last three quarters of  largely due to the volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets 
during those periods  we experienced declines in revenue and profitability  and there can be no assurance that there will not be declines in our aum  revenue and profitability should volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets occur again in the future 
an economic downturn  and volatility in the global financial markets  could also significantly affect the estimates  judgments  and assumptions used in the valuation of our financial instruments 
our revenue for the three years ended december  was generally derived from advisory fees  which are typically based on the market value of our aum  which can be affected by adverse changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange and equity prices 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities would cause our revenue and income to decline  due to a decrease in the value of the assets we manage 
in addition  such a decline could cause our clients to withdraw their funds in favor of investments offering higher returns or lower risk  which would cause our revenue and income to decline further 
we are also subject to market risk due to a decline in the value of the holdings of our consolidated subsidiaries  which consist primarily of marketable securities and investments in mutual funds 
at december   the fair value of these assets was million and million  respectively 
assuming a increase or decrease  the fair value would increase or decrease by million and million  respectively  at december  interest rate risk since the company does not have any debt that bears interest at a variable rate  it does not have any direct exposure to interest rate risk at december
