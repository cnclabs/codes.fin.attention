item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this form k  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  may contain various forward looking statements and includes assumptions concerning the company s operations  future results and prospects 
these forward looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company provides this cautionary statement identifying important economic  political and technological factors  among others  the absence or effect of which could cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward looking statements and related assumptions 
such factors include the following the impact on business conditions in general  and on the demand for product in the aerospace and power generation industries in particular  of the global economic outlook  including the continuation of military spending at or near current levels and the availability of capital and liquidity from banks and other providers of credit  future business environment  including capital and consumer spending  competitive factors  including the ability to replace business which may be lost  successful development of turbine component repair processes and or procurement of new repair process licenses from turbine engine manufacturers and or the federal aviation administration  metals and commodities price increases and the company s ability to recover such price increases  successful development and market introduction of new products and services  continued reliance on consumer acceptance of regional and business aircraft powered by more fuel efficient turboprop engines  continued reliance on military spending  in general  and or several major customers  in particular  for revenues  the impact on future contributions to the company s defined benefit pension plans due to changes in actuarial assumptions  government regulations and the market value of plan assets  stable governments  business conditions  laws  regulations and taxes in economies where business is conducted  and the ability to successfully integrate businesses that may be acquired into the company s operations 
the company and its subsidiaries engage in the production and sale of a variety of metalworking processes  services and products produced primarily to the specific design requirements of its customers 
the processes and services include both conventional and precision forging  heat treating  coating  welding  precision component machining and selective plating 
the products include conventional and precision forged components  machined forged components  other machined metal components  remanufactured component parts for turbine engines  and selective plating solutions and equipment 
the company s operations are conducted in three business segments forged components group  turbine component services and repair group  and applied surface concepts group 
the company endeavors to plan and evaluate its businesses operations while taking into consideration certain factors including the following i the projected build rate for commercial  business and military aircraft as well as the engines that power such aircraft  ii the projected build rate for industrial gas turbine engines  iii the projected maintenance  repair and overhaul schedules for commercial  business and military aircraft as well as the engines that power such aircraft  and iv anticipated exploration and production activities relative to oil and gas products  etc 
the primary factor that impacts the operating income of all three of the company s business segments  in a similar manner  is net sales and related production volumes 
this is due to the fact that each of the company s segments operates within a cost structure that includes a significant fixed component 
therefore  higher net sales volumes are expected to result in greater operating income because such higher volumes allow the business segments operations to better leverage the fixed component of their respective cost structures 
conversely  the opposite effect is expected to occur at lower net sales and related production volumes 
a 
results of operations non gaap financial measures presented below is certain financial information based on our ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
references to ebitda mean earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and references to adjusted ebitda mean ebitda plus  as applicable for each relevant period  certain adjustments as set forth in the reconciliations of net income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda is a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the company presents ebitda and adjusted ebitda because i it believes they are useful indicators for evaluating operating performance and liquidity  including the company s ability to incur and service debt and ii it uses ebitda to evaluate prospective acquisitions 
although the company uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the reasons noted  the use of these non gaap financial measures as analytical tools has limitations and  therefore  reviewers of the company s financial information should not consider them in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of its results of operations as reported in accordance with gaap 
some of these limitations are neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda reflects the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments  on indebtedness  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda reflects any cash requirements for such replacements  the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with the company s intangible assets further limits the usefulness of ebitda and adjusted ebitda  neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda includes the payment of taxes  which is a necessary element of operations  and adjusted ebitda excludes the cash expense the company has incurred to acquire businesses 
because of these limitations  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to the company to invest in the growth of its businesses 
management compensates for these limitations by not viewing ebitda or adjusted ebitda in isolation and specifically by using other gaap measures  such as net income  net sales and operating profit  to measure operating performance 
neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda is a measurement of financial performance under gaap  and neither should be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with gaap 
the company s calculation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda dollars in thousands september  net income adjustments depreciation and amortization expense interest expense  net income tax provision ebitda adjustments inventory purchase accounting adjustments acquisition transaction related expenses equity compensation expense lifo provision adjusted ebitda represents accounting adjustments to inventory associated with acquisitions of businesses that were charged to cost of sales when the inventory was sold 
represents transaction related costs comprising legal  financial and tax due diligence expenses  and valuation services costs that are required to be expensed as incurred 
represents the equity based compensation expense recognized by the company under its long term incentive plan

as discussed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company completed the purchase of the forging businesses and substantially all related operating assets of qaf and twf on october  and december   respectively 
forged components group forge group the forge group consists of the production  heat treatment  surface treatment  non destructive testing  and machining of both conventional and precision forged components in various steel  titanium and aluminum alloys utilizing a variety of processes for application principally in the aerospace and power generation industries 
the forge group s results for fiscal include the results of qaf from the date of its acquisition 
the forge group s results for fiscal include the results of twf from the date of acquisition 
net sales in fiscal increased to million  compared with million in fiscal the forge group produces forged components for i turbine engines that power commercial business and regional aircraft as well as military aircraft and armored military vehicles  ii airframe applications for a variety of aircraft  iii industrial gas turbine engines for power generation units  and iv other commercial applications 
net sales comparative information for fiscal and  respectively  is as follows dollars in millions year ended september  increase decrease net sales aerospace components for fixed wing aircraft rotorcraft components for power generation units commercial product sales and other revenue total the increase in net sales of forged components for fixed wing aircraft and rotorcraft during fiscal  compared with fiscal  is principally due to the impact of the acquisition of qaf during the first quarter of fiscal the increase in net sales of components for power generation units is due to the full year impact in fiscal of the acquisition of twf during the first quarter of fiscal the forge group s aerospace components have both military and commercial applications 
net sales of such components that solely have military applications were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of qaf 
demand for additional military helicopters and related replacement components are the primary drivers of such military sales demand 
the forge group s cost of goods sold increased million to million  or of net sales  during fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales in fiscal cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales reflected an increase in fiscal  compared to fiscal  due to the net impact of the changes in the following components of manufacturing related expenditures the material component of manufacturing costs was approximately of net sales during fiscal  compared with of net sales in fiscal  due primarily to the mix of product a higher concentration of products  with lower material content  were sold during the fiscal  compared with fiscal all other manufacturing costs were approximately of net sales during fiscal  compared with of net sales in the comparable period in fiscal labor costs  as a percentage of net sales  were higher principally due to the mix of product a higher concentration of products with higher labor content were sold during fiscal  compared with the comparable period in fiscal the forge group also experienced a reduction in its labor efficiency during fiscal  compared with fiscal the following changes in the components of the forge group s other manufacturing overhead expenditures during fiscal compared with fiscal  a portion of which was due to the acquisitions of qaf and twf  also impacted cost of goods sold dollars in millions year ended september  increase decrease manufacturing expenditures overhead utilities repairs  maintenance and supplies depreciation rent tooling manufacturing costs in fiscal  compared with the same period in fiscal  increased due to i an increase in manufacturing expenditures required to support the million of additional product sales volume for the forge group and ii an increase in depreciation and rent expense  all of which were primarily attributable to the acquisitions of twf and qaf 
these higher costs were partially offset by a decrease in the price paid for natural gas in fiscal  compared with fiscal the forge group s selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is principally due to i a million increase in amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisitions of twf and qaf and ii a million increase in relative spending levels due to the impact of the acquisitions of twf and qaf 
the forge group s selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal  before the impact of the amortization of intangible assets  was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the forge group s operating income decreased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the following is a comparison of operating income on both a lifo and fifo basis dollars in millions year ended september  increase decrease operating income operating income lifo expense operating income without lifo expense the forge group s operating income in fiscal was favorably impacted by the increase in gross profit generated from million of additional product sales volumes for twf and qaf plus the net impact of the other cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expense factors noted above 
turbine component services and repair group repair group during fiscal  net sales  which consist principally of component repair services including precision component machining and industrial coatings for small aerospace turbine engines  decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal the decrease in net sales during fiscal  compared with fiscal  is attributable to a decrease in product sales volumes 
the repair group s cost of goods sold decreased million to million or of net sales in fiscal  compared with million or of net sales fiscal cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales reflected an increase in fiscal  compared to fiscal  due principally to the repair group maintaining a minimum base cost structure that has a large fixed component that is determined necessary to sustain an operation with relevant capabilities 
during fiscal  the repair group s selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the repair group s decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is principally attributable to million of expense related to the impairment of a long lived asset recognized in fiscal the repair group s operating loss in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal operating results in fiscal were negatively impacted by the significantly lower product sales volumes in relation to the large fixed component of the repair group s operating cost structure 
the repair group will need to increase its product sales volumes to increase its operating income 
applied surface concepts group asc group net sales in fiscal increased to million  compared with million in fiscal for purposes of the following discussion  i product net sales consist of selective plating equipment and solutions and ii contract service net sales consist of customized selective plating services 
net sales comparative information for fiscal and  respectively  is as follows dollars in millions year ended september  increase decrease net sales product contract service other total the increase in product net sales in fiscal  compared with fiscal  is attributed to an increase in net sales volumes of selective plating equipment and solutions  as well as a general price increase implemented at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal a portion of the asc group s business is conducted in europe and is denominated in local european currencies 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal  compared with fiscal  had a nominal impact on net sales 
the asc group s cost of goods sold increased million to million  or of net sales  during fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales reflected a decrease in fiscal  compared to fiscal  due principally to the following the material component of cost of goods sold was approximately of net sales during fiscal  compared with of net sales in fiscal  due principally to certain higher commodity prices and the mix of product a higher concentration of products and contract services  with higher material content  were sold during fiscal  compared with fiscal all other cost of goods sold were approximately of net sales during fiscal  compared with of net sales in fiscal the primary reason for the reduction of all other cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales is the impact of higher sales volumes during fiscal  compared with fiscal  which allowed the asc group to favorably leverage the fixed component of its operating cost structure 
the asc group s selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales in fiscal the million increase is due primarily to an increase in sales promotion efforts and the filling of an open sales position 
the asc group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal corporate unallocated expenses corporate unallocated expenses  consisting of corporate salaries and benefits  legal and professional and other expenses that are not related to and  therefore  not allocated to the business segments  were in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the million increase is due to a million increase in legal and professional expenses principally to support the acquisition of qaf  a million increase in the company s long term equity incentive plan expense  partially offset by a million decrease in the company s annual cash incentive plan expense 
other general interest expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  in connection with the october acquisition of the qaf business  the company borrowed million from its revolving credit agreement and million on a term note  and issued a million promissory note to the seller of the qaf business 
the following table sets forth the weighted average interest rates and weighted average outstanding balances under the company s debt agreement in fiscal and weighted average interest rate year ended september  weighted average outstanding balance year ended september  revolving credit agreement million million term note n a million n a promissory note n a million n a other income  net consists principally of million of rental income earned from the lease of the cork  ireland facility 
the company believes that inflation did not materially affect its results of operations in either fiscal or  and does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in fiscal income tax provision the company s effective tax rate in fiscal was  compared to in fiscal  and differs from the us federal statutory rate due primarily to i the impact of us state and local taxes  ii domestic production activities deduction  iii application of tax credits  and iv the recognition of federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries 
b 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased to million at september   compared with million at september   at september   essentially all of the million of the company s cash and cash equivalents are in the possession of its non us subsidiaries for purposes of i funding the respective subsidiary businesses current operations outside the us and ii to fund potential future investment outside the us in the future  if the company determines that there is no longer a need to maintain such cash within its non us operations  it may elect to distribute such cash to its us operations 
distributions from the company s us subsidiaries to the company may be subject to adverse tax consequences 
the company s operating activities provided million of cash in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to i net income of million  ii million from the net impact of such non cash items as depreciation and amortization expense  deferred taxes  equity compensation expense and lifo expense and iii a million decrease in accounts receivable 
these items were partially offset by a million increase in inventories 
these changes in the components of working capital do not reflect the impact of the opening balance sheet related to the acquisition of qaf and were due primarily to factors resulting from normal business conditions of the company  including i building inventory in response to customer demand  ii the relative timing of collections from customers and iii the relative timing of payments to suppliers and tax authorities 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal capital expenditures during fiscal consisted of million by the forge group  million by the asc group and million by the repair group 
in addition to the million expended during fiscal  million has been committed as of september  the company anticipates that total fiscal capital expenditures will be within the range of to million and will relate principally to the further enhancement of production and product offering capabilities across all three of the company s business groups 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company declared a special cash dividend of per common share  which will result in a cash expenditure of million during first quarter of fiscal as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  the company acquired a forging business in october for approximately million at closing 
the acquisition was financed by borrowing approximately million from its bank  which borrowing consisted of a new million term loan and drawing approximately million from its revolving credit facility 
the balance of the acquisition was financed by the company issuing a million promissory note to the seller  which note is payable by the company in november in october  the company entered into an amendment to its existing credit agreement with its bank increasing the maximum borrowing amount from million to million  of which million is a five year term loan and million is a five year revolving loan  secured by substantially all the assets of the company and its us subsidiaries and a pledge of of the stock of its non us subsidiaries 
the term loan is repayable in quarterly installments of million starting december  the term loan has a variable interest rate based on libor  which becomes an effective fixed rate of after giving effect to an interest rate swap agreement 
borrowing under the revolving loan bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus to  which percentage fluctuates based on the company s leverage ratio of outstanding indebtedness to ebitda 
the bank loans are subject to certain customary financial covenants including  without limitation  covenants that require the company to not exceed a maximum leverage ratio and to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
there is also a commitment fee ranging from to to be incurred on the unused balance 
the promissory note issued to the seller is non interest bearing and is due in november of the company was in compliance with all applicable loan covenants as of september  future cash flows from the company s us operations will be used to pay down amounts outstanding under the company s credit agreement 
the company believes it has adequate cash available in the possession of its non us subsidiaries to finance its non us operations 
the company believes it has adequate cash liquidity available to finance its u 
s operations from the combination of i the company s expected cash flows from us operations and ii funds available under its existing credit agreement 
c 
off balance sheet arrangements other than an interest rate swap agreement that the company entered into with its bank  as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  the company does not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement that have had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
d 
critical accounting policies and estimates allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowances for doubtful accounts each quarter based on the customers credit worthiness  current economic trends or market conditions  past collection history  aging of outstanding accounts receivable and specific identified risks 
as these factors change  the company s allowances for doubtful accounts may change in subsequent periods 
historically  losses have been within management s expectations and have not been significant 
inventories the company maintains allowances for obsolete and excess inventory 
the company evaluates its allowances for obsolete and excess inventory each quarter 
each business segment maintains formal policies  which require at a minimum that reserves be established based on an analysis of the age of the inventory 
in addition  if the company learns of specific obsolescence  other than that identified by the aging criteria  an additional reserve will be recognized as well 
specific obsolescence may arise due to a technological or market change  or based on cancellation of an order 
management s judgment is necessary in determining the realizable value of these products to arrive at the proper allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
this review involves judgment and is performed using estimates of future undiscounted cash flows  which include proceeds from disposal of assets and which the company considers a critical accounting estimate 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  then the long lived asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
in projecting future undiscounted cash flows  the company relies on internal budgets and forecasts  and projected proceeds upon disposal of long lived assets 
the company s budgets and forecasts are based on historical results and anticipated future market conditions  such as the general business climate and the effectiveness of competition 
the company believes that its estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of such undiscounted cash flows and fair value could change the company s estimates of fair value  which could result in future impairment charges 
impairment of goodwill goodwill is the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of an acquired business 
the determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired typically involves obtaining independent appraisals of certain tangible and intangible assets and may require management to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding future events 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to an impairment testing annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
for the purposes of impairment testing  goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the reporting entity expected to benefit from the business combination 
goodwill impairment testing involves the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit  which is determined by its discounted cash flows  with its carrying value 
the company allocates the fair value of the reporting unit to all of its assets  other than goodwill  and liabilities 
any remaining unallocated fair value is then allocated to goodwill as its implied fair value 
the amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 
purchase price allocations the costs of business acquisitions are allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their respective fair value at the time of the acquisition 
the determination of fair values typically involves obtaining independent appraisals of certain tangible and intangible assets and may require management to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding future events 
in determining fair value  management may develop a number of possible future cash flow scenarios to which probabilities are judgmentally assigned and evaluated 
this allocation process impacts the company s reported assets and liabilities and future net income 
defined benefit pension plan expense the company maintains three defined benefit pension plans in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under these three defined benefit pension plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing various assumptions 
the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions elements associated with these defined benefit pension plans 
one significant assumption in determining net pension expense is the expected return on plan assets 
the company determines the expected return on plan assets principally based on i the expected return for the various asset classes in the respective plans investment portfolios and ii the targeted allocation of the respective plans assets 
the expected return on plan assets is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current and anticipated market conditions such as inflation  interest rates and market performance 
should the actual rate of return differ materially from the assumed expected rate  the company could experience a material adverse effect on the funded status of its plans and  accordingly  on its related future net pension expense 
another significant assumption in determining the net pension expense is the discount rate 
the discount rate for each plan is determined  as of the fiscal year end measurement date  using prevailing market spot rates from an appropriate yield curve with maturities corresponding to the expected timing date of the future defined benefit payment amounts for each of the respective plans 
such corresponding spot rates are used to discount future years projected defined benefit payment amounts back to the fiscal year end measurement date as a present value 
a composite discount rate is then developed for each plan by determining the single rate of discount that will produce the same present value as that obtained by applying the annual spot rates 
the discount rate may be further revised if the market environment indicates that the above methodology generates a discount rate that does not accurately reflect the prevailing interest rates as of the fiscal year end measurement date 
deferred tax valuation allowance the company accounts for deferred taxes in accordance with the provisions of the accounting standards codification asc guidance related to accounting for income taxes  whereby the company recognizes an income tax benefit related to its consolidated net losses and other temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax reporting basis 
e 
impact of newly issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standard update asu  intangibles goodwill and other  which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived asset is impaired for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
the asu is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this asu did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu  and as a result entities are required to continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before asu this update is effective for public companies with fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures
