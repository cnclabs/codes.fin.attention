our business is highly cyclical in nature 
the pulp business is highly cyclical in nature and markets for our principal products are characterized by periods of supply and demand imbalance  which in turn affects product prices 
pulp markets are highly competitive and are sensitive to cyclical changes in the global economy  industry capacity and foreign exchange rates  all of which can have a significant influence on selling prices and our operating results 
the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time but generally reflect changes in macro economic conditions and levels of industry capacity 
industry capacity can fluctuate as changing industry conditions can influence producers to idle production capacity or permanently close mills 
in addition  to avoid substantial cash costs in idling or closing a mill  some producers will choose to operate at a loss  sometimes even a cash loss  which can prolong weak pricing environments due to oversupply 
oversupply of our products can also result from producers introducing new capacity in response to favorable pricing trends 
demand for pulp has historically been determined primarily by the level of economic growth and has been closely tied to overall business activity 
from to mid  pulp prices steadily improved 
however  the global economic crisis in the latter half of resulted in a sharp decline of pulp prices from a high of per admt to per admt at the end of pulp prices began to increase in the second half of and continued to increase to record levels through june of  before declining slightly in the fourth quarter of pulp prices again rebounded to record levels in the first half of but declined sharply in the latter part of the year  primarily due to economic uncertainty in europe and credit tightening in china 
we cannot predict the impact of sustained economic weakness on the demand and prices for our products 
prices for pulp are driven by many factors outside our control  and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes  which are often volatile 
because market conditions beyond our control determine the price for pulp  prices may fall below our cash production costs  requiring us to either incur short term losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of our mills 
therefore  our profitability depends on managing our cost structure  particularly raw materials which represent a significant component of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control 
if the prices of our products decline  or if prices for our raw materials increase  or both  our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents our level of indebtedness could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we had approximately million of indebtedness outstanding  of which million relates to the stendal loan facility 
we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future 
our high debt levels may have important consequences for us  including  but not limited to the following our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate and other purposes or to fund future operations may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all  a significant amount of our operating cash flow is dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness  thereby diminishing funds that would otherwise be available for our operations and for other purposes  increasing our vulnerability to current and future adverse economic and industry conditions  a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows or increase in our expenses could make it more difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements  which could force us to modify our operations  our leveraged capital structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage by hindering our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions or by making us vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy in general  causing us to offer debt or equity securities on terms that may not be favorable to us or our shareholders  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes and opportunities in our business and our industry  and our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal or interest due in respect of our indebtedness 
the indenture governing our senior notes and our bank credit facilities contain restrictive covenants which impose operating and other restrictions on us and our subsidiaries 
these restrictions will affect  and in many respects will limit or prohibit  our ability to  among other things  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or enter into sale leaseback transactions  pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock  make investments or acquisitions  create liens and enter into mergers  consolidations or transactions with affiliates 
the terms of our indebtedness also restrict our ability to sell certain assets  apply the proceeds of such sales and reinvest in our business 
failure to comply with the covenants in the indenture relating to our senior notes or in our bank credit facilities could result in events of default and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future financial and operating performance 
our performance  in turn  will be subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions  as well as financial  business  legislative  regulatory  industry and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our ability to meet our future debt service and other obligations  in particular the stendal loan facility  may depend in significant part on the extent to which we can implement successfully our business strategy 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized 
a weakening of the global economy could adversely affect our business and financial results and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources 
global financial markets experienced extreme and unprecedented disruption in the second half of  including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit 
table of contents availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
although financial markets have stabilized and the modest global economic recovery which emerged in the second half of largely continued through  the overall state of the global economy remains generally weak and we remain subject to a number of risks associated with these adverse economic conditions 
price appreciation in and the first half of has been due in significant part to demand from china and other asian countries  and any reduction in demand in these locations could exacerbate the impact of economic weakness elsewhere 
principally  as pulp demand has historically been determined by the level of economic growth and business activity  demand and prices for our product have historically decreased substantially during economic slowdowns 
additionally  restricted credit availability restrains our customers ability or willingness to purchase our products resulting in lower revenues 
depending on their severity and duration  the effects and consequences of a global economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources  including our ability to raise capital  if needed  and otherwise negatively impact our business and financial results 
cyclical fluctuations in the price and supply of our raw materials could adversely affect our business 
our main raw material is fiber in the form of wood chips and pulp logs 
such fiber is cyclical in terms of both price and supply 
the cost of wood chips and pulp logs is primarily affected by the supply and demand for lumber 
demand for these raw materials is generally determined by the volume of pulp and paper products produced globally and regionally 
since  generally higher energy prices  a focus on  and governmental initiatives related to  green or renewable energy have led to an increase in renewable energy projects in europe  including germany 
demand for wood residuals from such energy producers  combined with lower harvesting rates  has generally put upward pressure on prices for wood residuals such as wood chips in germany and its neighboring countries 
this has resulted in higher fiber costs for our german mills and such trend could continue to put further upward pressure on wood chip prices 
similarly  north american sawmill activity declined significantly during the recession  reducing the supply of chips and availability of pulp logs to our celgar mill 
additionally  north american energy producers are exploring the viability of renewable energy initiatives and governmental initiatives in this field are increasing  all of which could lead to higher demand for sawmill residual fiber  including chips 
the cyclical nature of pricing for these raw materials represents a potential risk to our profit margins if pulp producers are unable to pass along price increases to their customers or we cannot offset such costs through higher prices for our surplus energy 
we do not own any timberlands or have any long term governmental timber concessions and we currently have few long term fiber contracts at our german operations 
raw materials are available from a number of suppliers and we have not historically experienced material supply interruptions or substantial sustained price increases  however our requirements have increased and may continue to increase as we increase capacity through capital projects or other efficiency measures at our mills 
as a result  we may not be able to purchase sufficient quantities of these raw materials to meet our production requirements at prices acceptable to us during times of tight supply 
in addition  the quantity  quality and price of fiber we receive could be affected as a result of industrial disputes  material curtailments or shut down of operations by suppliers  government orders and legislation including new taxes or tariffs  weather conditions  acts of god and other events beyond our control 
an insufficient supply of fiber or reduction in the quality of fiber we receive would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
in addition to the supply of wood fiber  we are dependent on the supply of certain chemicals and other inputs used in our production facilities 
any disruption in the supply of these chemicals or other inputs could affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and could harm our reputation 
any material increase in the cost of these chemicals or other inputs could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents we operate in highly competitive markets 
we sell our pulp globally  with a large percentage sold in europe  north america and asia 
the markets for pulp are highly competitive 
a number of other global companies compete in each of these markets and no company holds a dominant position 
our pulp is considered a commodity because many companies produce similar and largely standardized products 
as a result  the primary basis for competition in our markets has been price 
many of our competitors have greater resources and lower leverage than we do and may be able to adapt more quickly to industry or market changes or devote greater resources to the sale of products than we can 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be competitive in the future 
the global pulp market has historically been characterized by considerable swings in prices which have and will result in variability in our earnings 
prices are typically denominated in us dollars 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations 
the majority of our sales are in products quoted in us dollars while most of our operating costs and expenses  other than those of the celgar mill  are incurred in euros 
in addition  all of the products sold by the celgar mill are quoted in us dollars and the celgar mill costs are primarily incurred in canadian dollars 
our results of operations and financial condition are reported in euros 
as a result  our revenues are adversely affected by a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro and to the canadian dollar 
such shifts in currencies relative to the euro and the canadian dollar reduce our operating margins and the cash flow available to fund our operations and to service our debt 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in  stendal entered into variable to fixed interest rate swaps to fix interest payments under the stendal mill financing facility  which has kept stendal from benefiting from the general decline in interest rates that ensued 
these derivatives are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and all unrealized gains and losses are recognized as earnings or losses for the relevant reporting periods 
increases in our capital expenditures or maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
our business is capital intensive and requires that we regularly incur capital expenditures to maintain our equipment  improve efficiencies and comply with environmental laws 
our annual capital expenditures may vary due to fluctuations in requirements for maintenance  business capital  expansion and as a result of changes to environmental regulations that require capital expenditures to bring our operations into compliance with such regulations 
in addition  our senior management and board of directors may approve projects in the future that will require significant capital expenditures 
increased capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
further  while we regularly perform maintenance on our manufacturing equipment  key pieces of equipment in our various production processes may still need to be repaired or replaced 
if we do not have sufficient funds or such repairs or replacements are delayed  the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we use derivatives to manage certain risk which has caused significant fluctuations in our operating results 
we use derivative instruments to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
concurrently with entering into the stendal financing  stendal entered into variable to fixed rate interest swaps for the full term of our stendal loan facility to manage its interest rate risk exposure with respect to the full principal amount of this facility 
because we effectively fixed the rate on our stendal loan facility  the value of our derivative position moves inversely to interest rates 
we record unrealized gains or losses on our derivative instruments when they are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and realized gains or losses on them when they are settled 
these unrealized and 
table of contents realized gains and losses can materially impact our operating results for any reporting period 
for example  our operating results for included an unrealized net loss of million on our interest rate derivative  while our operating results for included an unrealized net gain of million 
for  our operating results included an unrealized net loss of million on our interest rate derivative 
if any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize are not effective  we may incur losses which may have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
further  we may in the future use derivative instruments to manage pulp price risks 
the purpose of our derivative activity may also be considered speculative in nature  we do not use these instruments with respect to any pre set percentage of revenues or other formula  but either to augment our potential gains or reduce our potential losses depending on our perception of future economic events and developments 
we are subject to extensive environmental regulation and we could have environmental liabilities at our facilities 
our operations are subject to numerous environmental laws as well as permits  guidelines and policies 
these laws  permits  guidelines and policies govern  among other things unlawful discharges to land  air  water and sewers  waste collection  storage  transportation and disposal  hazardous waste  dangerous goods and hazardous materials and the collection  storage  transportation and disposal of such substances  the clean up of unlawful discharges  land use planning  municipal zoning  and employee health and safety 
in addition  as a result of our operations  we may be subject to remediation  clean up or other administrative orders or amendments to our operating permits  and we may be involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings or inquiries 
future orders  proceedings or inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental laws and land use laws and regulations are constantly changing 
new regulations or the increased enforcement of existing laws could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
in addition  compliance with regulatory requirements is expensive  at times requiring the replacement  enhancement or modification of equipment  facilities or operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our profitability by offsetting any increased costs of complying with future regulatory requirements 
we are subject to liability for environmental damage at the facilities that we own or operate  including damage to neighboring landowners  residents or employees  particularly as a result of the contamination of soil  groundwater or surface water and especially drinking water 
the costs of such liabilities can be substantial 
our potential liability may include damages resulting from conditions existing before we purchased or operated these facilities 
we may also be subject to liability for any offsite environmental contamination caused by pollutants or hazardous substances that we or our predecessors arranged to transport  treat or dispose of at other locations 
in addition  we may be held legally responsible for liabilities as a successor owner of businesses that we acquire or have acquired 
except for stendal  our facilities have been operating for decades and we have not done invasive testing to determine whether or to what extent environmental contamination exists 
as a result  these businesses may have liabilities for conditions that we discover or that become apparent  including liabilities arising from 
table of contents non compliance with environmental laws by prior owners 
because of the limited availability of insurance coverage for environmental liability  any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations might require significant capital expenditures 
we may be unable to generate sufficient funds or access other sources of capital to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures 
our business is subject to risks associated with climate change and social and government responses thereto 
currently  there are differing scientific studies and opinions relating to the severity  extent and speed at which climate change is or may be occurring around the world 
as a result  we are currently unable to identify and predict all of the specific consequences of climate change on our business and operations 
to date  the potential and or perceived effects of climate change and social and government responses to it have created both opportunities  such as enhanced sales of surplus green energy  and risks for our business 
while all of the specific consequences from climate change are not yet predictable  we are subject to risks that government and social focus on and demand for carbon neutral or green energy will create greater demand for the wood residuals or fiber that is consumed by our pulp mills as part of their production process 
in addition  governmental initiatives or legislation may also increase both the demand and prices for wood residuals 
as governments pursue green energy initiatives  they may implement financial  tax  pricing or other legislated incentives for renewable energy producers that cannibalize or materially adversely affect fiber supplies for existing traditional users  such as lumber and pulp and paper producers 
such additional demand for wood residuals and or governmental initiatives may materially increase the competition and prices for wood residuals over time 
this could increase our fiber costs and or restrict our ability to acquire fiber at competitive prices or at all during times of shortages 
if our fiber costs increase and we cannot pass on these costs to our customers or offset them through higher prices for our sales of surplus energy  it will negatively affect our operating margins  results of operations and financial position 
if we cannot obtain the fiber required to operate our mills  we may have to curtail and or shut down production 
this could have a material adverse effect on operations  financial results and financial position 
other potential risks to our business from climate change include a greater susceptibility of northern softwood forest to disease  fire and insect infestation  which could diminish fiber availability  the disruption of transportation systems and power supply lines due to more severe storms  the loss of water transportation for logs and our finished goods inventories due to lower water levels  decreases in quantity and quality of processed water for our mill operations  the loss of northern softwood boreal forests in areas in sufficient proximity to our mills to competitively acquire fiber  and lower harvest levels decreasing the supply of harvestable timber and  as a consequence  wood residuals 
the occurrence of some or all of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operations and or financial results 
project blue mill may not generate the results or benefits we expect 
project blue mill is subject to customary risks and uncertainties inherent for large capital projects which could result in the project not completing on schedule or as budgeted 
the stendal mill could experience 
table of contents operating difficulties or delays during the start up period when the new mw turbine is being ramped up 
project blue mill may not increase the stendal mill s pulp production and energy generating capacity to the levels we had planned 
cost overruns  equipment breakdowns or failures to perform to design specifications could have a material adverse effect on our stendal mill s results of operations and financial performance 
we are subject to risks related to our employees 
the majority of our employees are unionized and we have collective agreements in place with our employees at all of our mills 
in september  we negotiated a four year collective agreement  effective may   with the hourly workers at our celgar mill and  in december  we entered into our current collective agreement with our rosenthal employees 
in july  we entered into a collective agreement with our pulp workers at the stendal mill 
although we have not experienced any work stoppages in the past  there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate acceptable collective agreements or other satisfactory arrangements with our employees upon the expiration of our collective agreements 
this could result in a strike or work stoppage by the affected workers 
the registration or renewal of the collective agreements or the outcome of our wage negotiations could result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members 
accordingly  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher on going labor costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
we rely on government grants and guarantees and participate in european statutory programs 
we currently benefit from a subsidized capital expenditure program and lower cost of financing as a result of german federal and state government grants and guarantees at our stendal mill 
should either the german federal or state governments be prohibited from honoring legislative grants and guarantees at stendal  or should we be required to repay any such legislative grants  this may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
since  our german mills have benefitted from sales of emission allowances under the eu emissions trading scheme 
as a result of our rosenthal and stendal mills eligibility for special tariffs under the renewable energy act  the amount of emissions allowances granted to our german mills under the eu ets has been reduced 
additionally  all such german legislation is subject to amendment or change which could adversely affect the eligibility of our rosenthal and stendal mills to participate in this statutory program and or the tariffs paid thereunder 
as a result we cannot predict with any certainty the amount of future sales of surplus energy we may be able to generate 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our future success depends  to a large extent  on the efforts and abilities of our executive and senior mill operating officers 
such officers are industry professionals many of whom have operated through multiple business cycles 
our officers play an integral role in  among other things sales and marketing  reducing operating costs  identifying capital projects which provide a high rate of return  and prioritizing expenditures and maintaining employee relations 
the loss of one or more of our officers could make us less competitive in these areas which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we do not maintain any key person life insurance for any of our executive or senior mill operating officers 

table of contents we may experience material disruptions to our production 
a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand  reduce our pulp and energy sales and or negatively impact our results of operations 
any of our mills could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events  including unscheduled maintenance outages  prolonged power failures  equipment failure  design error or employee or contractor error  chemical spill or release  explosion of a boiler  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  including roads  bridges  railway tracks  tunnels  canals and ports  fires  floods  earthquakes or other natural catastrophes  prolonged supply disruption of major inputs  labor difficulties  and other operational problems 
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures 
if any of our facilities were to incur significant downtime  our ability to meet our production capacity targets and satisfy customer requirements would be impaired and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events  including the emergence of a pandemic  terrorist attacks or natural disasters 
the occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events  including the emergence of a pandemic or other widespread health emergency or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency  terrorist attacks or natural disasters  could create economic and financial disruptions  could lead to operational difficulties including travel limitations that could impair our ability to manage or operate our business and adversely affect our results of operations 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate 
we have obtained insurance coverage that we believe would ordinarily be maintained by an operator of facilities similar to our mills 
our insurance is subject to various limits and exclusions 
damage or destruction to our facilities could result in claims that are excluded by  or exceed the limits of  our insurance coverage 
additionally  the weak global and financial markets have also reduced the availability and extent of credit insurance for our customers 
if we cannot obtain adequate credit insurance for our customers  we may be forced to amend or curtail our planned operations which could negatively impact our sales revenues  results of operations and financial position 
we rely on third parties for transportation services 
our business primarily relies upon third parties for the transportation of pulp to our customers  as well as for the delivery of our raw materials to our mills 
our pulp and raw materials are principally transported by truck  
table of contents barge  rail and sea going vessels  all of which are highly regulated 
increases in transportation rates can also materially adversely affect our results of operations 
further  if our transportation providers fail to deliver our pulp in a timely manner  it could negatively impact our customer relationships and we may be unable to sell it at full value 
if our transportation providers fail to deliver our raw materials in a timely fashion  we may be unable to manufacture pulp in response to customer orders 
also  if any of our transportation providers were to cease operations  we may be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could materially adversely affect our results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations for the three years ended december  is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in forward looking statements 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
results of operations general we operate in the pulp business and our operations are located in germany and western canada 
our mills have a current combined annual production capacity of approximately  admts of nbsk pulp 
we operate in markets that are global  cyclical and commodity based 
our financial performance depends on a number of variables that impact sales and production costs 
sales and production results are influenced largely by the market price for our products  raw materials and foreign currency exchange rates 
kraft pulp markets are highly cyclical  with prices determined by supply and demand 
demand for kraft pulp is influenced to a significant degree by global levels of economic activity and supply is driven by industry capacity and utilization rates 
our product mix is important because premium grades of nbsk pulp generally achieve higher prices and profit margins 
global economic conditions  changes in production capacity and inventory levels are the primary factors affecting kraft pulp prices 
historically  kraft pulp prices have been cyclical in nature 
the average european list prices for nbsk pulp between and ranged from a low of per admt in to  per admt in in the latter part of  as a result of the global economic crisis and difficult market conditions  the nbsk market was characterized by poor demand and rapidly declining prices 
at the end of  nbsk list prices in europe had declined to per admt 
as world economies began to stabilize  nbsk list prices rebounded in the latter part of to finish at per admt in europe at year end 
such price improvement was partially offset by the weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and the canadian dollar during the period 
in  several increases lifted prices to record levels in the middle of the year 
although pulp list prices continued to increase through the first half of  economic uncertainty in europe and credit tightening in china resulted in a decline in pulp prices in the fourth quarter of as at december   list prices were  and per admt in europe  north america and china  respectively 
although we believe that a modest price recovery might occur in early  as pulp prices are highly cyclical  there can be no assurance that prices will not decline in the future 
our sales realizations are list prices reduced by customer discounts and other items 
our reported average sale price realizations are affected by nbsk price movements between the order and shipment dates 
during the last three years  energy production and sales of surplus energy have become a key source of revenues for us 
in  and  our mills generated  mwh   mwh and  mwh  respectively  of surplus energy  primarily from a renewable carbon neutral source 
at the end of september  we completed the celgar energy project 
increasing our generation and sales of surplus renewable energy will continue to be a key focus for us in the near term and  to this end  our project blue mill will  in addition to increasing pulp production and efficiencies through debottlenecking  also increase energy production by  admts 
we are currently exploring various other initiatives to enhance our generation and sales revenues 
such initiatives  if implemented  will require additional capital spending 
our production costs are influenced by the availability and cost of raw materials  energy and labor  and our plant efficiencies and productivity 
our main raw material is fiber in the form of wood chips and pulp logs 

table of contents wood chip and pulp log costs are primarily affected by the supply of  and demand for  lumber and pulp  which are both highly cyclical 
overall weak lumber markets in have resulted in reduced sawmilling activity and log harvesting in both germany and british columbia 
this has reduced the supply of both wood residuals such as chips and pulp logs 
this cyclical supply reduction has put upward pressure on fiber prices 
additionally  higher energy prices and a focus on green or renewable energy  while benefiting our surplus power sales  has also led to an overall increase in demand for wood residuals from other renewable energy producers such as pellet producers 
we currently expect demand from renewable energy producers will likely continue to increase over the long term  thereby putting upward pressure on prices for wood residuals such as wood chips in germany and its neighboring countries 
similarly  renewable energy initiatives in british columbia are increasing and could also lead to higher demand for wood residuals there over time 
higher fiber costs could affect producer profit margins if they are unable to pass along price increases to pulp customers or purchasers of surplus energy 
our celgar mill historically relied primarily upon sawmill chips for the substantial majority of its fiber supply 
with the severe economic decline in and the corresponding adverse effect it had on the us housing and lumber industries  many sawmills shut down or dramatically curtailed their production 
this resulted in a significantly reduced supply of sawmill chips and materially higher fiber prices for the celgar mill 
as a result  we implemented a substantial enhancement to the whole log chipping facility at our celgar mill 
during  we started up this new facility and  over the course of the year  substantially enhanced its capability so that it is now capable of supplying approximately of the celgar mill s total fiber needs 
the ability to conduct such whole log chipping has permitted the celgar mill to materially reduce its dependence on third party field chippers and residual sawmill chips and to better manage its fiber costs 
for a more detailed discussion of our fiber needs and resources  see business operating costs fiber 
production costs also depend on the total volume of production 
high operating rates and production efficiencies permit us to lower our average cost by spreading fixed costs over more units 
higher operating rates also permit us to increase our generation and sales of surplus renewable energy 
our production levels are also dependent on  among other things  the number of days of scheduled and unscheduled downtime at our mills 
unexpected production downtime  which has not materially affected us during any of the periods described in this discussion  can be particularly disruptive in our industry 
our currently scheduled production downtime for our mills in  compared to prior years  is as follows rosenthal scheduled production downtime days celgar scheduled production downtime days stendal scheduled production downtime days projected for in addition to the nine day scheduled production downtime taken by the rosenthal mill  we also idled our electricity generation for an additional days for turbine maintenance 
our financial performance for any reporting period is also impacted by changes in the us dollar to euro and canadian dollar exchange rates and in interest rates 
changes in currency rates affect our operating results because the price for our principal product  nbsk pulp  is generally based on a global industry benchmark that is quoted in us dollars  even though a significant portion of the sales from our german mills is invoiced in euros and we report our results in euros 
therefore  a weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the canadian dollar will generally reduce the amount of our pulp operations revenues 
most of our operating costs at our german mills  including our debt obligations under the stendal loan facility and our revolving working capital facility related to the rosenthal mill  are incurred in euros 
most of our operating costs at the celgar mill  including the mill s working capital facility  are in canadian dollars 
these costs do not fluctuate with the us dollar to euro or canadian dollar exchange rates 
thus  a weakening of the us dollar against the euro and 
table of contents the canadian dollar tends to reduce our sales revenue  gross profit and income from operations 
conversely  an increase in the us dollar versus the euro and the canadian dollar positively impacts our revenues and increases our operating margins and cash flow 
changes in interest rates can impact our operating results because the credit facilities established for our mills use floating rates of interest  to the extent that we have not hedged these rates 
from time to time  we also enter into interest rate  foreign currency and energy derivative contracts to partially protect against the effect of such changes 
gains or losses on such derivatives are included in our earnings  either as they are settled or as they are marked to market for each reporting period 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
stendal  as required under the stendal loan facility  entered into variable to fixed rate interest swaps  referred to as the stendal interest rate swap contract  in august to fix the interest rate on approximately million of indebtedness for the full term of the stendal loan facility 
in  we recorded a net unrealized non cash loss of million before noncontrolling interest on the mark to market valuation on the stendal interest rate swap contract due to a small decrease in long term european interest rates 
in and  before noncontrolling interest on the stendal interest rate swap contract we recorded a non cash gain of million and a non cash loss of million  respectively 
changes in long term interest rates could result in our recording of further unrealized non cash gains or losses on the stendal interest rate swap contract in future periods when they are marked to market 
significant actions in  we took the following significant actions redeemed or converted all of our outstanding convertible notes  purchased and cancelled approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes and approximately million shares million of our common stock  improved the fiber line and oxygen delignification process at the celgar mill  continued to focus on cost reductions and working capital management  and continued to improve operations  which allowed us to achieve record annual pulp production and energy generation 
current market environment after reaching record levels in the middle of  pulp prices declined in the second half of the year  primarily as a result of economic uncertainty in europe and credit tightening in china 
although pulp markets continue to face some difficult changes  we believe that the market is currently at the bottom of the pulp price cycle and we expect that a modest price recovery will occur in the near to mid term

in  operating ebitda decreased to million from million in operating ebitda is defined as operating income loss plus depreciation and amortization and non recurring capital asset impairment charges 
management uses operating ebitda as a benchmark measurement of its own operating results  and as a benchmark relative to its competitors 
management considers it to be a meaningful supplement to operating income as a performance measure primarily because depreciation expense and non recurring capital asset impairment charges are not an actual cash cost  and depreciation expense varies widely from company to company in a manner that management considers largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of their operating facilities 
in addition  we believe operating ebitda is commonly used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance 
operating ebitda does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income loss attributable to common shareholders  including financing costs and the effect of derivative instruments 
operating ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or income loss from operations as a measure of performance  nor as an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
operating ebitda has significant limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are that operating ebitda does not reflect i our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ii changes in  or cash requirements for  working capital needs  iii the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our outstanding debt  iv noncontrolling interest on our stendal nbsk pulp mill operations  v the impact of realized or marked to market changes in our derivative positions  which can be substantial  and vi operating ebitda does not reflect the impact of impairment charges against our investments or assets 
because of these limitations  operating ebitda should only be considered as a supplemental performance measure and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
see the statement of cash flows set out in our consolidated financial statements included herein 
because all companies do not calculate operating ebitda in the same manner  operating ebitda as calculated by us may differ from operating ebitda or ebitda as calculated by other companies 
we compensate for these limitations by using operating ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance and by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements

foreign exchange 
as nbsk pulp is principally quoted in us dollars  the amount of revenues we generate fluctuates with changes in the value of the us dollar to the euro 
based upon our revenues  each change in the value of the us dollar yields a change in annual gross sales revenue of approximately million

table of contents sources and uses of funds our principal sources of funds are cash flows from operations  cash on hand and the revolving working capital loan facilities for our celgar and rosenthal mills 
our principal uses of funds consist of operating expenditures  payments of principal and interest on the stendal loan facility  capital expenditures and interest payments on our outstanding senior notes 
as at december   our cash and cash equivalents and holdings of short term german federal government bonds were million  compared to million at the end of in  to increase its liquidity and financial flexibility  stendal entered into the amendment for its stendal loan facility 
the amendment revised the repayment schedule of principal payments due by deferring approximately million of principal payments until maturity on september  the deferred amount includes approximately million  million and million of scheduled principal payments in  and  respectively 
in accordance with the revised repayment schedule  we made principal payments totaling million during and million during the amendment also provided for a cash sweep of any excess cash of stendal which will be used first to prepay the deferred amount and second to fund the dsra 
not included in the cash sweep is million which stendal is permitted to retain for working capital purposes 
for a description of the stendal loan facility see item business description of certain indebtedness 
the stendal loan facility is provided by a syndicate of eleven financial institutions and both our celgar working capital facility and our rosenthal loan facility are each provided by one financial institution 
to date we have not experienced any reductions in credit availability with respect to these credit facilities 
however  if any of these financial institutions were to default on their commitment to fund  we could be adversely affected 
for a description of the celgar working capital facility and the rosenthal loan facility  see item business description of certain indebtedness

for a description of the senior notes  see item business description of certain indebtedness 
debt covenants our long term obligations contain various financial tests and covenants customary to these types of arrangements 
the stendal loan facility contains an annual debt service cover ratio which  pursuant to the terms of the amendment  must not fall below x for the period from december  to december  and x for the period after january  until maturity on september  the amendment also implements a 
table of contents permitted leverage ratio of total debt to ebitda which is effective from december  this ratio  which the lenders waived for  is set to decline over time from x on its effective date to x on june  failure to comply with either ratio constitutes an event of default  but may be cured by the shareholders of stendal with a once per fiscal year ratio deficiency cure through a capital contribution or subordinated loan in the amount necessary to cure such deficiency 
under the rosenthal loan facility  our rosenthal mill must not exceed a ratio of net debt to ebitda of in any month period and there must be a ratio of ebitda to interest expense equal to or in excess of for each month period 
additionally  current assets to current liabilities must equal or exceed the celgar working capital facility includes a covenant that  for so long as the excess amount under the facility is less than c million  then until it becomes equal to or greater than such amount  the celgar mill must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than for each month period 
as at december   we were in full compliance with all of the covenants of our indebtedness 
cash flow analysis cash flows from operating activities 
we operate in a cyclical industry and our operating cash flows vary accordingly 
our principal operating cash expenditures are for labor  fiber  chemicals and debt service 
working capital levels fluctuate throughout the year and are affected by maintenance downtime  changing sales patterns  seasonality and the timing of receivables and the payment of payables and expenses 
generally  finished goods inventories are increased prior to scheduled maintenance downtime to maintain sales volume while production is stopped 
our fiber inventories exhibit seasonal swings as we increase pulp log and wood chip inventories to ensure adequate supply of fiber to our mills during the winter months 
changes in sales volume can affect the level of receivables and influence overall working capital levels 
we believe our management practices with respect to working capital conform to common business practices 
operating activities in provided cash of million  compared to providing cash of million in an increase in receivables  excluding non cash items  used cash of million in  compared to an increase in receivables using cash of million in an increase in inventories used cash of million in  compared to an increase in inventories using cash of million in an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses provided cash of million in and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses used cash of million in cash flows from investing activities 
investing activities in used cash of million  primarily due to capital spending of million and the purchase of marketable securities of million 
investing activities in used cash of million  primarily due to capital spending of million 
in  capital expenditures  primarily related to various projects at our mills  used cash of million 
in the same period last year  capital expenditures primarily related to the celgar energy project used cash of million 
excluding costs for projects being financed through government grants under the gtp  we expect our consolidated capital expenditures in to total approximately million  primarily comprised of project blue mill at our stendal mill and an array of small projects at our other mills 
cash flows from financing activities 
in  financing activities used net cash of million  primarily due to using cash of million to redeem all of our remaining senior notes  million to repay principal under the stendal loan facility  million to repay the balance of our celgar working capital facility  million to purchase shares of our common stock and million to purchase and 
table of contents extinguish some of our senior notes 
in  we received million in government grants 
in  financing activities used net cash of million  primarily due to cash used to repurchase our senior notes and million in cash used to pay down the stendal loan facility  offset by the receipt of million in government grants for the celgar energy project and the proceeds received from the sale of the senior notes 
capital resources as at december   we had no material commitments to acquire assets or operating businesses 
in january  we committed to implementing project blue mill at a cost of million  which will primarily be funded through million of non refundable german government grants and the million blue mill facility 
the balance of project blue mill will be funded through operating cash flow of the stendal mill and up to an aggregate million in pro rata shareholder loans from mercer and stendal s noncontrolling shareholder 
in february  we entered into a support agreement the support agreement with fibrek inc fibrek whereby we agreed to make a take over offer to acquire all of fibrek s outstanding common shares 
pursuant to the terms of the support agreement  the cash portion of the aforesaid offer would be c million  which we intend to finance through new credit facilities established with qu bec based capital providers 
separately  we have agreed to acquire approximately million special warrants of fibrek at a cost of approximately c million which we intend to fund from cash on hand and or our existing credit facilities 
at this time  there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully complete the offer for the fibrek shares or acquire the warrants of fibrek  either as currently provided for or on amended terms  obtain the required consents and approvals related to the said acquisition  or otherwise complete such transaction 
future liquidity our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  or to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness  or to fund planned expenditures will depend on our future performance  which is subject to general economic  financial and other factors that are beyond our control 
based upon the current level of operations and our current expectations for future periods in light of the current economic environment  and in particular  current and expected pulp pricing and foreign exchange rates  we believe that cash flow from operations and available cash  together with available borrowings under our celgar working capital facility and rosenthal loan facility  will be adequate to meet the future liquidity needs during the next months

purchase obligations relate primarily to take or pay contracts  including for purchases of raw materials  made in the ordinary course of business 
other long term liabilities relate primarily to future payments that will be made for post employment benefits other than pensions 
those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions  including expected future service  to project the future obligations 
additionally  the balance also includes pension funding which is calculated on an annual basis 
consequently  the amount includes million related to pension funding 
we have identified approximately million of potential tax liabilities that are more likely than not to be paid and approximately million of asset retirement obligations 
however  due to the uncertain timing related to these potential liabilities  we are unable to allocate the payments in the contractual obligations table 
foreign currency our reporting currency is the euro as the majority of our business transactions are denominated in euros 
however  we hold certain assets and liabilities in us dollars and canadian dollars 
accordingly  our consolidated financial results are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we translate foreign denominated assets and liabilities into euros at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
equity accounts are translated using historical exchange rates 
unrealized gains or losses from these translations are recorded in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income loss and do not affect our net earnings 

table of contents in the year ended december   we reported a net million foreign currency translation loss and  as a result  the cumulative foreign exchange translation gain reported within accumulated other comprehensive income loss decreased to million at december  in the year ended december   we reported a net million foreign currency translation gain 
based upon the exchange rate at december   the us dollar has increased by approximately in value against the euro since december  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk results of operations of the restricted group under our senior note indenture the indenture governing our senior notes requires that we also provide a discussion in annual and quarterly reports we file with the sec under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the results of operations and financial condition of mercer inc and our restricted subsidiaries under the indenture  referred to as the restricted group

table of contents restricted group results year ended december  compared to year ended december  pulp revenues for the restricted group for the year ended december  increased by approximately to million from million in the comparative period of  primarily due to significantly higher pulp prices and a stronger us dollar relative to the euro 
revenues from the sale of excess energy remained relatively consistent in both and  primarily due to the commencement of power sales under the celgar energy project  mostly offset by scheduled turbine maintenance at our rosenthal mill in during  the rosenthal mill had nine days of downtime for scheduled maintenance and its turbine was down for an additional days for maintenance 
during such day period  the rosenthal mill produced pulp at capacity but purchased energy instead of selling surplus energy

factors that may affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance and liquidity 
credit rating downgrades can adversely impact  among other things  future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 
in november  as a result of our deleveraging strategy and increased renewable energy production at our celgar mill  moody s upgraded its outlook from stable to positive while keeping the rating for our senior notes at b further  despite pulp price decreases in the second half of  moody s expects that pulp prices will remain high enough over the near term to enable us to continue to generate strong cash flows and further reduce our debt 
during the second quarter of  we were subject to improved rating actions by s p 
in july  s p raised its ratings on the senior notes from b to b and improved its recovery rating from to 
the improved ratings reflect our balance sheet deleveraging in the first half of and s p s belief that demand for nbsk pulp should remain robust and that our liquidity position should continue to improve

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the amount and the timing of recording of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying note disclosures 
our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our audited annual consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report 
while all of the significant accounting policies are important to the consolidated financial statements  some of these policies may be viewed as having a high degree of judgment 
on an ongoing basis using currently available information  management reviews its estimates  including those related to accounting for pensions and post retirement benefits  provisions for bad debt and doubtful accounts  derivative instruments  impairment of long lived assets  deferred taxes  inventory provisions and environmental conservation and legal liabilities 
actual estimates could differ from these estimates 
the following accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  and are subject to a fair degree of measurement uncertainty 
derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are measured at fair value and reported in the balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
accounting for gains or losses depends on the intended use of the derivative instruments 
gains or losses on derivative instruments which are not designated hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in earnings in the period of the change in fair value 
gains or losses on derivative instruments formally designated as hedges are recognized in either earnings or other comprehensive income 
in  we reported a net unrealized non cash holding loss of million before noncontrolling interest in respect of the stendal interest rate swap contract 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the review of recoverability  we estimate future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management to make subjective judgments 
in addition  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity of the assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
our management considers the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  actual impairment losses could vary materially  either positively or negatively  from estimated impairment losses 
as a result of improving market conditions  we concluded that there were no impairment indicators 
accordingly  we did not undertake a long lived asset impairment review in deferred taxes 
we currently have deferred tax assets which are comprised primarily of tax loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  both of which will reduce taxable income in the future 
the amounts recorded for deferred tax are based upon various judgments  assumptions and estimates 
we assess the realization of these deferred tax assets on a periodic basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required 
we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized  based on currently available information  including  but not limited to  the following the history of the tax loss carryforwards and their expiry dates  future reversals of temporary differences  
table of contents our projected earnings  and tax planning opportunities 
if we believe that it is more likely than not that some of these deferred tax assets will not be realized  based on currently available information  an income tax valuation allowance is recorded against these deferred tax assets 
additionally  based on guidance noted in fasb accounting standards codification topic  income taxes  tax assets are not permitted to be recognized where the entity does not have a strong history of profitability 
as at december   we had million in deferred tax assets and million in deferred tax liabilities  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million 
our tax assets are net of a million valuation allowance 
for the year ended december   our review concluded that it was appropriate to decrease the valuation allowance against loss carryforwards by approximately million  after considering expected future earnings and reversals of temporary differences 
if market conditions improve or tax planning opportunities arise in the future  we will reduce our valuation allowances  resulting in future tax benefits 
if market conditions deteriorate in the future  we will increase our valuation allowances  resulting in future tax expenses 
any change in tax laws  particularly in germany  will change the valuation allowances in future periods 
inventory provisions 
inventories of nbsk pulp and logs and wood chips are valued at the lower of cost  using the weighted average cost method  or net realizable value 
we estimate the net realizable value based on future cash flows expected to result from the sale of our product nbsk pulp 
the cash flows are estimated based on the expected time it will take to exhaust the respective inventory  including estimates of additional costs that will need to be incurred to bring that inventory to a salable state 
the future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management to make subjective judgments 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
we consider the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows  actual inventory provisions could vary materially  either positively or negatively  from estimated inventory provisions 
as at december   we did not record an inventory provision against any of our finished goods and raw materials inventories 
new accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking information the statements in this annual report on form k that are not reported financial results or other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  as amended 
these statements appear in a number of different places in this report and can be identified by words such as estimates  projects  expects  intends  believes  plans  or their negatives or other comparable words 
also look for discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements include statements regarding the outlook for our future operations  forecasts of future costs and expenditures  the evaluation of market conditions  the outcome of legal proceedings  the adequacy of reserves  or other business plans 
you are cautioned that any such forward looking statements are not guarantees and may involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements due to risks facing us or due to actual facts differing from the assumptions underlying our estimates 
some of these risks and assumptions include those set forth in reports and other documents we have filed with or furnished to the sec  including in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  we advise you that these cautionary remarks expressly qualify in their entirety all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf 
unless required by law  we do not assume any obligation to 
table of contents update forward looking statements based on unanticipated events or changed expectations 
however  you should carefully review the reports and other documents we file from time to time with the sec 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to those set forth under item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on revenues or income during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar and the canadian dollar versus the us dollar and the euro 
changes in these rates may affect our results of operations and financial condition and  consequently  our fair value 
we seek to manage these risks through internal risk management policies as well as the use of derivatives 
we use derivatives to reduce or limit our exposure to interest rate and currency risks 
we may in the future use derivatives to reduce or limit our exposure to fluctuations in pulp prices 
we also use derivatives to reduce our potential losses or to augment our potential gains  depending on our management s perception of future economic events and developments 
these types of derivatives are generally highly speculative in nature 
they are also very volatile as they are highly leveraged given that margin requirements are relatively low in proportion to notional amounts 
many of our strategies  including the use of derivatives  and the types of derivatives selected by us  are based on historical trading patterns and correlations and our management s expectations of future events 
however  these strategies may not be effective in all market environments or against all types of risks 
unexpected market developments may affect our risk management strategies during this time  and unanticipated developments could impact our risk management strategies in the future 
if any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize is not effective  we may incur significant losses 
derivatives derivatives are contracts between two parties where payments between the parties are dependent upon movements in the price of an underlying asset  index or financial rate 
examples of derivatives include swaps  options and forward rate agreements 
the notional amount of the derivatives is the contract amount used as a reference point to calculate the payments to be exchanged between the two parties and the notional amount itself is not generally exchanged by the parties 
the principal derivatives we use are foreign exchange derivatives and interest rate derivatives 
foreign exchange derivatives include currency swaps which involve the exchange of fixed payments in one currency for the receipt of fixed payments in another currency 
such cross currency swaps involve the exchange of both interest and principal amounts in two different currencies 
they also include foreign exchange forwards which are contractual obligations in which two counterparties agree to exchange one currency for another at a specified price for settlement at a pre determined future date 
forward contracts are effectively tailor made agreements that are transacted between counterparties in the over the counter market 
interest rate derivatives include interest rate forwards forward rate agreements which are contractual obligations to buy or sell an interest rate sensitive financial instrument on a future date at a specified price 
they also include interest rate swaps which are over the counter contracts in which two counterparties exchange interest payments based upon rates applied to a notional amount 

table of contents energy derivatives include fixed electricity forward sales and purchase contracts which are contractual obligations to buy or sell electricity at a future specified date 
our mills produce surplus electricity that we sell to third parties 
as a result  we monitor the electricity market closely 
where possible and to the extent we think it is advantageous  we may sell into the forward market through forward contracts 
we occasionally use foreign exchange derivatives to convert some of our costs including currency swaps relating to our long term indebtedness from euros to us dollars as our principal product is priced in us dollars 
we have also converted some of our costs to us dollars by issuing long term us dollar denominated debt in the form of our senior notes 
we use interest rate derivatives to fix the rate of interest on indebtedness  including under the stendal loan facility 
the interest rate derivatives we entered into were pursuant to the stendal loan facility which provides facilities for foreign exchange derivatives  interest rate derivatives and commodities derivatives  subject to prescribed controls  including maximum notional and at risk amounts 
the stendal loan facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the stendal mill and has the benefit of certain german governmental guarantees 
this credit facility does not have a separate margin requirement when derivatives are entered into and is subsequently marked to market each period 
the rosenthal loan facility also allows us to enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to its operations but  as at december   we had not entered into any such derivative instruments 
we record unrealized gains and losses on our outstanding derivatives when they are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and realized gains or losses on them when they are settled 
we determine market valuations based primarily upon valuations provided by our counterparties 
in august  stendal entered into the stendal interest rate swap contract in connection with its long term indebtedness relating to the stendal mill to fix the interest rate under the stendal loan facility at the then low level  relative to its historical trend and projected variable interest rate 
these contracts were entered into under a specific credit line under the stendal loan facility and are subject to prescribed controls  including certain maximum amounts for notional and at risk amounts 
under the stendal interest rate swap contract  stendal pays a fixed rate and receives a floating rate with the interest payments being calculated on a notional amount 
the interest rates payable under the stendal loan facility were swapped into fixed rates based on the eur euribor rate for the repayment periods of the tranches under the stendal loan facility 
stendal effectively converted the stendal loan facility from a variable interest rate loan into a fixed interest rate loan  thereby reducing interest rate uncertainty 
we are exposed to very modest credit related risks in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivative contracts 
however  we do not expect that the counterparties  which are major financial institutions and large utilities  will fail to meet their obligations 
the following table and the notes thereto sets forth the maturity date  the notional amount  the recognized gain or loss and the strike and swap rates for derivatives that were in effect during and december  december  derivative instrument maturity date notional amount recognized gain loss notional amount recognized gain loss in millions in thousands in millions in thousands interest rate derivatives stendal interest rate swap october   in connection with the stendal loan facility  in the third quarter of stendal entered into the stendal interest rate swap contract  which are variable to fixed interest rate swaps  for the term of the stendal 
table of contents loan facility  with respect to an aggregate maximum amount of approximately million of the principal amount of the long term indebtedness under the stendal loan facility 
the remaining contract commenced in april for a notional amount of million  with an interest rate of  and the notional amount gradually decreases and the contract terminates upon the maturity of the stendal loan facility in october interest rate risk fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of fixed interest rate financial instruments which are sensitive to such fluctuations 
a decrease in interest rates may increase the fair value of such fixed interest rate financial instrument assets and an increase in interest rates may decrease the fair value of such fixed interest rate financial instrument liabilities  thereby increasing our fair value 
an increase in interest rates may decrease the fair value of such fixed interest rate financial instrument assets and a decrease in interest rates may increase the fair value of such fixed interest rate financial instrument liabilities  thereby decreasing our fair value 
we seek to manage our interest rate risks through the use of interest rate derivatives
