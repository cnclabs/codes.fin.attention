item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal  and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
overview we derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of bulk and specialty chemicals to our customers in a wide variety of industries 
we began our operations primarily as a distributor of bulk chemicals with a strong customer focus 
over the years we have maintained the strong customer focus and have expanded our business by increasing our sales of value added specialty chemical products  including repackaging  blending and manufacturing certain products 
in recent years  we significantly expanded the sales of our higher margin blended and manufactured products  including our food grade products 
we have continued to invest in growing our business 
during fiscal  we purchased a acre parcel of land in rosemount  minnesota and began construction of a new facility on the site  which is expected to be operational in late fiscal the site provides capacity for future business growth and lessens our dependence on our flood prone sites on the mississippi river 
while we expect to transfer some blending and manufacturing activity to the rosemount site  we do not intend to close any sites we currently operate 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of vertex  for approximately million 
in addition to the manufacture of sodium hypochlorite bleaches  vertex distributes and provides terminal services for bulk liquid inorganic chemicals  and contract and private label packaging for household chemicals 
we believe the acquisition strengthens our market position in the midwest 
operating results of vertex are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition in this annual report on form k as part of our industrial segment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in fiscal  we completed two new facilities to expand our ability to service our customers and facilitate growth within our industrial group 
our facility in centralia  illinois began operations in july and primarily serves our food grade and agriculture products businesses 
we also opened a facility in minneapolis  minnesota  to handle bulk chemicals sold to pharmaceutical manufacturers 
we opened one new branch for our water treatment group in fiscal and two new branches in fiscal and expect to continue to invest in existing and new branches to expand our water treatment group s geographic coverage 
the cost of these branch expansions is not expected to be material 
in addition  we have selectively added route sales personnel to certain existing water treatment group branch offices to spur growth within our existing geographic coverage area 
in february  we agreed to sell our inventory and entered into a marketing agreement regarding the business of our pharmaceutical segment  which provided pharmaceutical chemicals to retail pharmacies and small scale pharmaceutical manufacturers 
the transaction closed in may and we have no significant obligations to fulfill under the agreement 
the results of the pharmaceutical segment have been reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented in this annual report on form k 
our financial performance in fiscal was highlighted by sales from continuing operations of million  a increase from fiscal  gross profit from continuing operations of million or of sales  a million increase in gross profit dollars from fiscal 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities of million  and cash and cash equivalents and investments available for sale were million as of the end of fiscal we seek to maintain relatively constant gross profit dollars on each of our products as the cost of our raw materials increase or decrease 
since we expect that we will continue to experience fluctuations in our raw material costs and resulting prices in the future  we believe that gross profit dollars is the best measure of our profitability from the sale of our products 
if we maintain relatively stable gross profit dollars on each of our products  our reported gross profit percentage will decrease when the cost of the product increases and will increase when the cost of the product decreases 
we use the last in  first out lifo method of valuing the vast majority of hawkins inventory  which causes the most recent product costs to be recognized in our income statement 
the valuation of lifo inventory for interim periods is based on our estimates of fiscal year end inventory levels and costs 
the lifo inventory valuation method and the resulting cost of sales are consistent with our business practices of pricing to current commodity chemical raw material prices 
our lifo reserve increased by million in fiscal primarily due to volumes and mix of commodity chemicals in inventory at the end of the year 
the increased reserve decreased our reported gross profit for the year 
our lifo reserve increased by million in fiscal due to rising costs and higher inventory volumes on hand at year end maintained to meet customer requirements during an anticipated flood 
this increase in the reserve decreased our reported gross profit in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our statement of income as a percentage of sales from period to period fiscal fiscal fiscal sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income investment income income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax net income fiscal compared to fiscal sales sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal  as compared to sales of million for fiscal vertex  which we acquired during the fourth quarter of  contributed million of the increase in sales for fiscal we also experienced increased sales as a result of higher selling prices due to increased commodity chemical prices 
sales of bulk chemicals  including caustic soda  were approximately of sales compared to approximately in the previous year 
the increase in the bulk 
table of contents chemical sales percentage for fiscal was primarily attributable to a full year of vertex sales volumes compared to a partial year of sales volumes in fiscal industrial segment 
industrial segment sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal vertex contributed million of the increase in sales for fiscal we experienced higher selling prices due to increased commodity chemical prices 
water treatment segment 
water treatment segment sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal the sales increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes related to manufactured and specialty chemical products and higher bulk chemical selling prices due to increased commodity chemical prices for those products 
gross profit gross profit was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the lifo method of valuing inventory negatively impacted gross profit by million for fiscal primarily due to volumes and mix of commodity chemicals in inventory at the end of the year 
in the prior year  lifo negatively impacted gross profit by million due to rising raw material costs and higher inventory volumes on hand at year end maintained to meet customer requirements during an anticipated flood 
industrial segment 
gross profit for the industrial segment was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the increase in gross profit dollars resulted from the addition of the vertex business to this segment  partially offset by lower selling prices due to competitive pricing pressures and lower volumes 
the lifo method of valuing inventory negatively impacted gross profit in this segment by million in fiscal and million in fiscal water treatment segment 
gross profit for the water treatment segment was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily due to increased sales volumes in the latter half of the fiscal more than offsetting lower volumes resulting from unfavorable weather conditions during the first half of the year and lower selling prices due to competitive pricing pressures 
the lifo method of valuing inventory negatively impacted gross profit in this segment by million in fiscal and million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the addition of expenses related to the vertex business  which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal  partially offset by one time costs we incurred in fiscal but did not experience in fiscal fiscal included approximately million in expense as a result of the death of john hawkins  our former chief executive officer  through payments due under his retention bonus agreement  and the accelerated vesting of his previously granted performance based restricted stock units and stock options as well as approximately million in vertex acquisition costs 
operating income operating income was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal a million increase in operating income for the industrial segment resulted primarily from the addition of the vertex business  partially offset by a million decrease in operating income for the water treatment segment 
both segments were negatively impacted by the lifo method of valuing inventory in fiscal and fiscal 
table of contents investment income investment income was million for fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in investment income was primarily due to lower cash and investment balances 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the higher effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily due to decreased permanent tax benefits and somewhat higher effective state tax rates 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal  as compared to sales of million for fiscal the sales increase was primarily driven by higher sales of manufactured and specialty chemical products and somewhat higher selling prices for bulk chemicals due to increasing commodity chemical costs 
sales of these bulk products were approximately of sales compared to approximately in the previous year 
additionally  the acquisition of vertex  which closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  contributed million in revenue 
industrial segment 
industrial segment sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal the sales increase was primarily attributable to higher sales of manufactured and specialty chemical products and somewhat higher selling prices for commodity bulk chemicals due to increased commodity chemical costs 
in addition  vertex revenues of million are included in fiscal industrial segment sales 
water treatment segment 
water treatment segment sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal the sales increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of manufactured and specialty chemical products 
gross profit gross profit was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the lifo method of valuing inventory negatively impacted gross profit by million for fiscal due to increased raw material costs and higher volumes of inventory at year end maintained to meet customer requirements during an anticipated flood 
in the prior year  lifo positively impacted gross profit by million due to decreases in certain raw material costs during that period 
industrial segment 
gross profit for the industrial segment was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal competitive pricing pressures and increased operational overhead costs contributed to the lower gross profit levels in the industrial segment 
this group incurred million of overhead costs associated with flood control efforts in the fourth quarter of fiscal these reductions in gross profit were partially offset by higher sales of higher margin manufactured and specialty chemical products 
the lifo method of valuing inventory negatively impacted gross profit in this segment by million in fiscal  as compared to positively impacting gross profit by million in fiscal water treatment segment 
gross profit for the water treatment segment was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the decrease in gross profit dollars was primarily due to competitive pricing pressures and increased operational overhead costs  partially offset by increased sales 
additionally  the lifo method of valuing inventory negatively impacted gross profit in this segment by million in fiscal  as compared to positively impacting gross profit by million in fiscal 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million to million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal we incurred approximately million in additional expense as a result of the death of john hawkins  our former chief executive officer  through payments due under his retention bonus agreement and the accelerated vesting of his previously granted performance based restricted stock units and stock options 
other items driving the increased expenses include acquisition costs of approximately million relating to the vertex acquisition in addition to higher equity incentive plan costs and litigation defense costs 
operating income operating income was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the decrease in operating income was the result of reduced gross profits and increased sg a expenses 
both reporting segments saw a decline in their gross profit dollars due to competitive pricing pressures and higher operational overhead costs 
both segments were also negatively impacted by the lifo method of valuing inventory in fiscal investment income investment income was million for fiscal and fiscal provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the lower effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily due to increased permanent tax differences  lower taxable income levels and somewhat lower effective state tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to increases in net income and depreciation and amortization 
higher working capital balances used million in cash in fiscal compared to cash used of million for working capital in fiscal the net increase in working capital balances in fiscal was primarily due to increasing commodity chemical costs and the resulting increase in selling prices  which resulted in an increase in trade receivables  lower accounts payable and income tax payable balances due to the timing of payments 
due to the nature of our operations  which includes purchases of large quantities of bulk chemicals  the timing of purchases can result in significant changes in working capital investment and the resulting operating cash flow 
historically  our cash requirements for working capital increase during the period from april through november as caustic soda inventory levels increase as the majority of barges are received during this period 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal was primarily due to proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options  recognition of excess tax benefits from share based compensation and proceeds from the issuance of new shares of common stock for the company s employee stock purchase plan 
cash and investments available for sale of million at april  increased by million as compared with april   primarily due to cash generated from operations  proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from the issuance of new shares of common stock through the company s employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by capital expenditures and dividend payments 
investments available for sale as of april  and april  consisted of certificates of deposit with maturities ranging from three months to two years 

table of contents capital expenditures capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal significant capital expenditures in fiscal consisted of approximately million related to business expansion and process improvement projects including the new facility in rosemount  minnesota and water treatment segment expansion  million for regulatory and safety improvements and million for other facility improvements and returnable containers 
we expect that recurring capital expenditures and safety improvements  facilities improvements and returnable containers  in fiscal will be comparable to the spending in fiscal we are projecting increased total capital spending in fiscal as compared with fiscal  as we complete the rosemount facility and make other expansion investments 
total capital spending in fiscal is currently projected to be approximately million 
we expect cash balances and our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements in fiscal dividends during the second quarter of fiscal  our board of directors increased our semi annual cash dividend by to per share from per share 
we first started paying cash dividends in and have continued to do so since 
future dividend levels will be dependent upon our results of operations  financial position  cash flows and other factors  and will be evaluated by our board of directors 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table provides aggregate information about our contractual payment obligations and the periods in which payments are due payments due by period contractual obligation more than years total in thousands operating lease obligations critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements  we follow us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we re evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we consider the following policies to involve the most judgment in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is evidence that the customer has agreed to purchase the product  the price and terms of the sale are fixed  the product has shipped and title passes to our customer  performance has occurred  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
lifo reserve inventories  with the exception of vertex inventories  are primarily valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined using the lifo method 
we may incur significant fluctuations in our gross margins due primarily to changes in the cost of a single  large volume component of our inventory 
the price of this inventory component may fluctuate depending on the balance between supply and demand 
management reviews the lifo reserve on a quarterly basis 
vertex inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined using the fifo method 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased 
goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment  and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test is performed using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment  if any  which should be recorded 
in the second step  an impairment loss would be recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses  projected capital expenditures  changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate 
the projections also take into account several factors including current and estimated economic trends and outlook  costs of raw materials  consideration of our market capitalization in comparison to the estimated fair values of our reporting units determined using discounted cash flow analyses and other factors which are beyond our control 
we completed step one of our annual goodwill impairment evaluation during the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that our reporting units fair value substantially exceeded their carrying value 
accordingly  step two of the impairment analysis was not required 
we also completed an impairment test of infinite life intangible assets during the fourth quarter  in which the fair value exceeded the carrying amount 
additionally  no impairment charges were required for fiscal or impairment of long lived assets we review the recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used  such as property  plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable  such as prolonged industry downturn or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted of the related operations 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset or asset group  an impairment is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived assets 
the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long lived assets 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows 
we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of long lived assets subject to amortization 
there were no triggering events that required long lived assets to be evaluated for impairment during fiscal income taxes in the preparation of our financial statements  management calculates income taxes 
this includes estimating the current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
these assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely 
reserves are also established for potential and ongoing audits of federal and state tax issues 
we routinely monitor the potential impact of such situations and believe that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to amounts owed and tax rates could be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates  our future taxable income levels and the results of tax audits

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to the risk inherent in the cyclical nature of commodity chemical prices 
however  we do not currently purchase forward contracts or otherwise engage in hedging activities with respect to the purchase of commodity chemicals 
we attempt to pass changes in material prices on to our customers  however  there are no assurances that we will be able to pass on the increases in the future
