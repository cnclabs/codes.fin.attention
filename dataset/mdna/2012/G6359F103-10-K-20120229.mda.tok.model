item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview this section is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and our financial condition 
this information is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we have grown from a land drilling business centered in the us lower states  canada and alaska to an international business with operations on land and offshore in many of the major oil and gas markets in the world 
our worldwide fleet of actively marketed rigs consists of land drilling rigs  rigs for land well servicing and workover work in the united states and canada  offshore platform rigs  jackup units  barge rigs and a large component of trucks and fluid hauling vehicles 
we have invested in oil and gas exploration  development and production activities in the united states  canada and colombia  but have announced our intention to dispose of a significant portion of our oil and gas portfolio in an expeditious and prudent manner 
the majority of our business is conducted through our various contract drilling operating segments  which include our drilling  well servicing and workover operations  on land and offshore 
our hydraulic fracturing and downhole surveying services are included in our pressure pumping operating segment 
our oil and gas exploration  development and production operations are included in our oil and gas operating segment  or in discontinued operations in some cases 
our operating segments engaged in drilling technology and top drive manufacturing  directional drilling  rig instrumentation and software  and construction operations are aggregated in our other operating segments 
our businesses depend  to a large degree  on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  development and production activities 
therefore  a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil  which could have a material impact on exploration  development and production activities  could also materially affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the magnitude of customer spending on new and existing wells is the primary driver of our business 
our customers spending is determined principally by their internally generated cash flow and to a lesser extent by joint venture arrangements and funding from the capital markets 
in our us lower land drilling  canadian drilling and pressure pumping business units  operations have traditionally been driven by natural gas prices but the majority of current activity is being driven by the price of oil and natural gas liquids from unconventional reservoirs shales 
in our alaskan  international  us offshore gulf of mexico  canadian well servicing and us land well servicing business units  operations are driven by oil prices 
the following table sets forth natural gas and oil price data per bloomberg for the last three years year ended december  increase decrease to to commodity prices average henry hub natural gas spot price thousand cubic feet mcf average west texas intermediate crude oil spot price barrel beginning in the fourth quarter of  there was a significant reduction in the demand for natural gas and oil that was caused  at least in part  by the significant deterioration of the global economic environment including the extreme volatility in the capital and credit markets 
weaker demand throughout and into the first half of resulted in sustained lower natural gas and oil prices  which led to a sharp decline in the demand for drilling and workover services 
during the latter half of and throughout  commodity prices strengthened and demand for drilling activity improved 
continued fluctuations in the demand for natural gas and oil  among other factors including supply  could contribute to continued price volatility which may continue to affect demand for our services and could materially affect our future financial results 
operating revenues and earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended december  totaled billion  representing an increase of billion  or as compared to the year ended december  adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  totaled million and million per diluted share  respectively  representing increases of and  respectively  compared to the year ended december

index to financial statements operating revenues and earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended december  totaled billion  representing an increase of million  or as compared to the year ended december  adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  totaled million and million 
per diluted share  respectively  representing increases of and  respectively  compared to the year ended december  during  operating results improved as compared to primarily due to the incremental revenue and positive operating results from the addition of our pressure pumping operating segment beginning in september  increased drilling activity in oil and liquids rich shale plays in our drilling operations in both our us lower land and canada drilling business units and increased well servicing activity in the us and canada 
however  our operating results and activity levels continued to be negatively impacted in our us offshore operations in response to uncertainty in the regulatory environment in the gulf of mexico  our alaskan operations due to key customers spending constraints  and in saudi arabia due to downtime and reduced rates on several jackup rigs 
our net income from continuing operations during was negatively impacted by million in impairments and other charges  million of which related to a provision for a contingent liability that existed on december  for a potential termination payment to our former chief executive officer 
see note for further discussion and subsequent developments 
the remaining million was comprised of a provision for retirement of long lived assets recorded by multiple operating segments 
this related to the decommissioning and retirement of assets previously utilized in our us lower land drilling  international and us well servicing operations and the amounts are reflected in the impairments and other charges line in our consolidated statements of income loss 
during  operating results improved over primarily due to the incremental revenue and positive operating results from our pressure pumping operating segment and increased drilling activity in in our us lower land drilling and canada well servicing operations relating to increased drilling activity in oil and the liquids oil shale plays 
our us well servicing business also improved with continuing strong crude oil prices  which led to increased activity 
however  our operating results and activity levels were negatively impacted in our us offshore  alaska and international operations 
our us offshore operations were improving during the first half of until the gulf of mexico explosion and oil spill occurred mid year  which resulted in temporary suspension of offshore drilling and further delays in our customers ability to obtain permits  which limited the use of our assets 
specifically  operating results were impacted because our customers suspended most of their operations in the gulf of mexico  largely as a result of their inability to obtain government permits 
our alaska operating segment was negatively impacted because the largest operator in the area curtailed and suspended drilling operations  creating a surplus of rigs in the market and causing price competition 
our international results were flat as the increase of land rig activity was essentially offset by contract renewals on our jackup rigs at significantly lower average dayrates 
our net income from continuing operations during was negatively impacted by impairments and other charges of million 
we recognized goodwill impairment and recorded provisions for retirement of long lived assets of approximately million and million  respectively  to assets in our us offshore operating segment  primarily driven by current market conditions in the gulf of mexico 
additionally  we recorded impairments of million relating to asset retirements across our us lower land  us well servicing and us offshore contract drilling segments 
discontinued operations include impairments of million relating to an oil and gas financing receivable and million under application of the successful efforts method of accounting for our wholly owned oil and gas related assets 
our net income from continuing operations during was negatively impacted by impairments and other charges of million 
the impairments and other charges included recognition of other than temporary impairments of million relating to our available for sale securities  and a provision for retirement totaling

index to financial statements million to long lived assets from our us offshore  alaska  canada and international contract drilling segments 
during  we sold some of our wholly owned oil and gas assets in colombia and received proceeds of million 
additionally  remora completed sales of its oil and gas assets in colombia for gross proceeds of million and has made cash distributions to us totaling million during with a final distribution expected upon dissolution of the joint venture 
we sold our working interest in properties located in california and received proceeds of million 
our discontinued operations also include impairments of million relating to oil and gas centered assets and million relating to carrying value aircraft and other drilling equipment 
we expect our operating results for to increase from levels realized during  driven by the anticipated sustained higher oil prices and the related impact on drilling and well servicing activity and dayrates  along with the contributions from our pressure pumping operating segment 
the key factors supporting our projections are an increase in drilling in oil and liquids rich areas incremental to traditional dry gas regions by our us lower land and canada drilling and well servicing operations  the extent of current term contracts in both our lower rig and pressure pumping segments  combined with new deployments in  should serve to mitigate the impact of a potentially more rapid reduction in gas drilling activity arising from weaker natural gas pricing  our expectation of a continued increase from ancillary well site services  primarily technical pumping services and down hole surveying services  resulting from our pressure pumping operating segment  and the anticipated positive impact on our overall level of drilling and well servicing activity and margins resulting from our new and upgraded rigs and equipment added to our fleet over the past five years  which we expect will enhance our competitive position as market conditions improve
