item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis  as well as other sections in this report  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
all references to years mean the relevant month period ended december overview general we are a technology based  specialty pharmaceutical company applying formulation and development expertise  as well as our drug delivery technology  to the development  manufacture and marketing of controlled release and niche generics  in addition to the development of branded products 
as of february   we marketed generic pharmaceuticals  which represent dosage variations of different pharmaceutical compounds through our own global pharmaceuticals division  another of our generic pharmaceuticals representing dosage variations of different pharmaceutical compounds are marketed by our alliance and collaboration agreement partners 
we have applications pending at the fda  including tentatively approved by the fda  and other products in various stages of development for which applications have not yet been filed 
in the generic pharmaceuticals market  we focus our efforts on controlled release generic versions of selected brand name pharmaceuticals covering a broad range of therapeutic areas and having technically challenging drug delivery mechanisms or limited competition 
we employ our technologies and formulation expertise to develop generic products that will reproduce the brand name product s physiological characteristics but not infringe any valid patents relating to the brand name product 
we generally focus on brand name products as to which the patents covering the active pharmaceutical ingredient have expired or are near expiration  and we employ our proprietary formulation expertise to develop controlled release technologies that do not infringe patents covering the brand name products controlled release technologies 
we are also developing specialty generic pharmaceuticals that we believe present one or more barriers to entry by competitors  such as difficulty in raw materials sourcing  complex formulation or development characteristics or special handling requirements 
in the brand name pharmaceuticals market  we are developing products for the treatment of central nervous system cns disorders 
our brand name product portfolio consists of development stage projects to which we are applying our formulation and development expertise to develop differentiated  modified  or controlled release versions of currently marketed either in the us or outside the us drug substances 
we intend to expand our brand name products portfolio primarily through internal development and also through licensing and acquisition 
we operate in two segments  referred to as the global pharmaceuticals division or global division and the impax pharmaceuticals division or impax division 

table of contents the global division develops  manufactures  sells  and distributes generic pharmaceutical products primarily through the following sales channels the global products sales channel  for sales of generic prescription products we sell directly to wholesalers  large retail drug chains  and others  the private label product sales channel  for generic pharmaceutical over the counter and prescription products we sell to unrelated third party customers who in turn sell the product to third parties under their own label  the rx partner sales channel  for generic prescription products sold through unrelated third party pharmaceutical entities under their own label pursuant to alliance agreements  and the otc partner sales channel  for sales of generic pharmaceutical over the counter products sold through unrelated third party pharmaceutical entities under their own label pursuant to alliance agreements 
we sell our global division products within the continental united states of america and the commonwealth of puerto rico 
we have no sales in foreign countries 
revenues from global product sales channel and the private label product sales channel are reported under the caption global product sales  net on the consolidated statement of operations 
we also generate revenue in our global division from research and development services provided under a joint development agreement with another pharmaceutical company  and we report such revenue under the caption research partner revenue on the consolidated statement of operations 
the impax division is engaged in the development of proprietary branded pharmaceutical products through improvements to already approved pharmaceutical products to address central nervous system cns disorders 
the impax division is also engaged in product co promotion through a direct sales force focused on promoting to physicians  primarily in the cns community  pharmaceutical products developed by other unrelated third party pharmaceutical entities 
additionally  we generate revenue in the impax division from research and development services provided under a development and license agreement with another unrelated third party pharmaceutical company  and we report such revenue in the line item research partner on the consolidated statement of operations 
finally  we generate revenue in the impax division under a license  development and commercialization agreement with another unrelated third party pharmaceutical company  and we report such revenue in the line item rx partner on the consolidated statement of operations 
we have entered into several alliance  collaboration or license and distribution agreements with respect to certain of our products and services and may enter into similar agreements in the future 
these agreements may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates  or to grant licenses on terms which ultimately may prove to be unfavorable to us 
relationships with alliance and collaboration partners may also include risks due to the failure of a partner to perform under the agreement  incomplete marketplace information  inventories  development capabilities  regulatory compliance and commercial strategies of our partners and our agreements may be the subject of contractual disputes 
if we  or our partners  are not successful in commercializing the products covered by the agreements  such commercial failure could adversely affect our business 
pursuant to a license and distribution agreement  we are dependent on an unrelated third party pharmaceutical company to supply us with our authorized generic adderall xr  which we market and sell 
we experienced disruptions related to the supply of our authorized generic adderall xr under the license and distribution agreement during each of the years ended december  and in november  we filed suit against the third party supplier of our authorized generic of adderall xr for breach of contract and other related claims due to a failure to fill our orders as required by the license and distribution agreement 
in addition  we have filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order seeking to require the third party supplier to fill product orders placed by us 
if we suffer supply disruptions related to our authorized generic adderall xr product in the future  our revenues and relationships with our customers may be materially adversely affected 
further  we may enter into similar license and distribution agreements in the future 

table of contents critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and the rules and regulations of the us securities exchange commission sec require the use of estimates and assumptions  based on complex judgments considered reasonable  and affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the most significant judgments are employed in estimates used in determining values of tangible and intangible assets  legal contingencies  tax assets and tax liabilities  fair value of share based compensation related to equity incentive awards issued to employees and directors  and estimates used in applying the company s revenue recognition policy including those related to accrued chargebacks  rebates  product returns  medicare  medicaid  and other government rebate programs  shelf stock adjustments  and the timing and amount of deferred and recognized revenue and deferred and amortized manufacturing costs under the company s several alliance and collaboration agreements 
actual results may differ from estimated results 
although we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable when made  they are based upon information available to us at the time they are made 
we periodically review the factors having an influence on our estimates and  if necessary  adjust such estimates 
although historically our estimates have generally been reasonably accurate  due to the risks and uncertainties involved in our business and evolving market conditions  and given the subjective element of the estimates made  actual results may differ from estimated results 
this possibility may be greater than normal during times of pronounced economic volatility 
global product sales  net 
we recognize revenue from direct sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 topic  revenue recognition sab 
revenue from direct product sales is recognized at the time title and risk of loss pass to customers 
accrued provisions for estimated chargebacks  rebates  product returns  and other pricing adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded 
consistent with industry practice  we record an accrued provision for estimated deductions for chargebacks  rebates  product returns  medicare  medicaid  and other government rebate programs  shelf stock adjustments  and other pricing adjustments  in the same period when revenue is recognized 
the objective of recording provisions for such deductions at the time of sale is to provide a reasonable estimate of the aggregate amount we expect to ultimately credit our customers 
since arrangements giving rise to the various sales credits are typically time driven ie particular promotions entitling customers who make purchases of our products during a specific period of time  to certain levels of rebates or chargebacks  these deductions represent important reductions of the amounts those customers would otherwise owe us for their purchases of those products 
customers typically process their claims for deductions in a reasonably timely manner  usually within the established payment terms 
we monitor actual credit memos issued to our customers and compare such actual amounts to the estimated provisions  in the aggregate  for each deduction category to assess the reasonableness of the various reserves at each quarterly balance sheet date 
differences between our estimated provisions and actual credits issued are accounted for in the current period as a change in estimate in accordance with gaap 
we do not have the ability to specifically link any particular sales credit to an exact sales transaction and since there have been no material differences  we believe our systems and procedures are adequate for managing our business 
an event such as the failure to report a particular promotion could result in a significant difference between the estimated amount accrued and the actual amount claimed by the customer  and  while there have been none to date  we would evaluate the particular events and factors giving rise to any such significant difference in determining the appropriate accounting 

table of contents chargebacks 
we have agreements establishing contract prices for specified products with some of our indirect customers  such as managed care organizations  hospitals  and government agencies who purchase our products from drug wholesalers 
the contract prices are lower than the prices the customer would otherwise pay to the wholesaler  and the difference is referred to as a chargeback  which generally takes the form of a credit memo issued by us to reduce the gross sales amount we invoiced to our wholesaler customer 
we recognize an estimated accrued provision for chargeback deductions at the time we ship the products to our wholesaler customers 
the primary factors we consider when estimating the accrued provision for chargebacks are the average historical chargeback credits given  the mix of products shipped  and the amount of inventory on hand at the major drug wholesalers with whom we do business 
we monitor aggregate actual chargebacks granted and compare them to the estimated accrued provision for chargebacks to assess the reasonableness of the chargeback reserve at each quarterly balance sheet date 
the following table is a roll forward of the activity in the chargeback reserve for the years ended december   and september  september  september  as of december  in s chargeback reserve beginning balance provision recorded during the period credits issued during the period ending balance provision as a percent of gross global product sales the lower provision for chargebacks as a percent of gross global product sales in as compared to both and was principally the result of the launch of our tamsulosin product  which generally resulted in higher gross global product sales and carried a lower average chargeback credit amount  relative to our other products sold through our global division s global products sales channel  during the year ended december  we commenced sales of our tamsulosin product on march  and had contractual market exclusivity for this generic product for the succeeding eight weeks  during which we were able to achieve high market share penetration 
our tamsulosin product sales after the end of the contractual exclusivity period  have not remained at this level  as additional competing generic versions of the product entered the market in late april  and have resulted in both price erosion and reduction of our market share 
see results of operations below for additional discussion on the impact of tamsulosin and our authorized generic of adderall xr product sales on our financial condition 

table of contents rebates 
in an effort to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace and to promote sales and customer loyalty  we maintain various rebate programs with our customers to whom we market our products through our global division global products sales channel 
the rebates generally take the form of a credit memo to reduce the invoiced gross sales amount charged to a customer for products shipped 
we recognize an estimated accrued provision for rebate deductions at the time of product shipment 
the primary factors we consider when estimating the provision for rebates are the average historical experience of aggregate credits issued  the mix of products shipped and the historical relationship of rebates as a percentage of total gross global product sales  the contract terms and conditions of the various rebate programs in effect at the time of shipment  and the amount of inventory on hand at the major drug wholesalers with which we do business 
we also monitor aggregate actual rebates granted and compare them to the estimated aggregate provision for rebates to assess the reasonableness of the aggregate rebate reserve at each quarterly balance sheet date 
the following table is a roll forward of the activity in the rebate reserve for the years december   and september  september  september  as of december  in s rebate reserve beginning balance provision recorded during the period credits issued during the period ending balance provision as a percent of gross global product sales the provision for rebates  as a percent of gross global product sales  remained relatively consistent from to the decrease in the provision for estimated rebates as a percent of gross global product sales from to was principally the result of our tamsulosin product and our authorized generic adderall xr products  both of which resulted in higher gross global product sales 
our tamsulosin product carried a lower rebate credit amount  relative to our other products sold through our global division s global products sales channel  resulting in a lower overall aggregate average rebate as a percentage of gross global product sales during the twelve months ended december  additionally  average rebates provided for as a percentage on sales of our authorized generic adderall xr products were lower during the year ended december  we commenced sales of our tamsulosin product on march  and had contractual market exclusivity for this generic product for the succeeding eight weeks  during which we were able to achieve high market share penetration 
following the expiration of our contractual exclusivity period  our tamsulosin product sales have decreased as additional competing generic versions of the product entered the market in late april  and have resulted in both price erosion and reduction of our market share 
see results of operations below for additional discussion on the impact of tamsulosin and our authorized generic of adderall xr product sales on our financial condition 

table of contents returns 
we allow our customers to return product i if approved by authorized personnel in writing or by telephone with the lot number and expiration date accompanying any request and ii if such products are returned within six months prior to  or until twelve months following  the products expiration date 
we estimate and recognize an accrued provision for product returns as a percentage of gross sales based upon historical experience of global division global product sales 
we estimate the product return reserve using a historical lag period  which is the time between when the product is sold and when it is ultimately returned  and estimated return rates which may be adjusted based on various assumptions including changes to internal policies and procedures  changes in business practices  and commercial terms with customers  competitive position of each product  amount of inventory in the wholesaler supply chain  the introduction of new products and changes in market sales information 
we also consider other factors  including significant market changes which may impact future expected returns  and actual product returns 
we monitor aggregate actual product returns on a quarterly basis and we may record specific provisions for product returns we believe are not covered by historical percentages 
the following table is a roll forward of the activity in the accrued product returns for the years ended december   and september  september  september  as of december  in s returns reserve beginning balance provision recorded during the period credits issued during the period ending balance provision as a percent of gross global product sales the provision for returns as a percent of global product sales  gross has declined steadily during the three year period ended december  as the result of continued improvement in our historical experience of actual return credits processed 
our historical experience for returns has improved due to the launch of new products in recent years  for example our tamsulosin product and our authorized generic adderall xr products 
credits issued during include million related to a recall of our authorized generic adderall xr products which was initiated by our unrelated third party manufacturer of those products 
excluding the recall credits noted above  credits issued during were million  in line with and credits issued 

table of contents medicaid 
as required by law  we provide a rebate payment on drugs dispensed under the medicaid program 
we determine our estimate of the accrued medicaid rebate reserve primarily based on historical experience of claims submitted by the various states and any new information regarding changes in the medicaid program which may impact our estimate of medicaid rebates 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we consider historical payment rates and processing lag for outstanding claims and payments 
we record estimates for medicaid payments as a deduction from gross sales  with corresponding adjustments to accrued liabilities 
the accrual for medicaid payments totaled  and  as of december  and the accrual for medicaid rebate payments increased significantly beginning in as a result of the launch of our authorized generic adderall xr products in october  as such medicaid rebate payments are calculated under the regulations applicable to brand products 
shelf stock adjustments 
based upon competitive market conditions  we may reduce the selling price of certain products 
we may issue a credit against the sales amount to a customer based upon their remaining inventory of the product in question  provided the customer agrees to continue to make future purchases of product from the company 
this type of customer credit is referred to as a shelf stock adjustment  which is the difference between the sales price and the revised lower sales price  multiplied by an estimate of the number of product units on hand at a given date 
decreases in selling prices are discretionary decisions made by us in response to market conditions  including estimated launch dates of competing products and estimated declines in market price 
the accrued reserve for shelf stock adjustments totaled  and  as of december  and historically  differences between our estimated and actual credits issued for shelf stock adjustments have not been significant 

table of contents rx partner and otc partner 
each of our rx partner and otc partner agreements involves multiple deliverables in the form of products  services and or licenses over extended periods 
financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification tm asc topic supplemented sab for accounting for such multiple element revenue arrangements 
with respect to our multiple element revenue arrangements  we determine whether any or all of the elements of the arrangement should be separated into individual units of accounting under fasb asc topic if separation into individual units of accounting is appropriate  we recognize revenue for each deliverable when the revenue recognition criteria specified by sab are achieved for the deliverable 
if separation is not appropriate  we recognize revenue and related direct manufacturing costs over the estimated life of the agreement or our estimated expected period of performance using either the straight line method or a modified proportional performance method 
the rx partners and otc partners agreements obligate us to deliver multiple goods and or services over extended periods 
such deliverables include manufactured pharmaceutical products  exclusive and semi exclusive marketing rights  distribution licenses  and research and development services 
in exchange for these deliverables  we receive payments from our agreement partners for product shipments  and may also receive royalty  profit sharing  and or upfront or periodic milestone payments 
revenue received from the agreement partners for product shipments under these agreements is generally not subject to deductions for chargebacks  rebates  returns  shelf stock adjustments  and other pricing adjustments 
royalty and profit sharing amounts we receive under these agreements are calculated by the respective agreement partner  with such royalty and profit share amounts generally based upon estimates of net product sales or gross profit which include estimates of deductions for chargebacks  rebates  returns  shelf stock adjustments and other adjustments the alliance agreement partners may negotiate with their customers 
we record the agreement partner s adjustments to such estimated amounts in the period the agreement partner reports the amounts to us 
we applied the updated guidance of asc  multiple element arrangements  to the strategic alliance agreement with teva pharmaceuticals curacao nv  a subsidiary of teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
teva agreement during the year ended december  we look to the underlying delivery of goods and or services which give rise to the payment of consideration under the teva agreement to determine the appropriate revenue recognition 
consideration received as a result of research and development related activities performed under the teva agreement is initially deferred and recorded as a liability captioned deferred revenue 
we recognize the deferred revenue on a straight line basis over our expected period of performance for such services 
consideration received as a result of the manufacture and delivery of products under the teva agreement is recognized at the time title and risk of loss passes to the customer which is generally when product is received by teva 
we recognize profit share revenue in the period earned 
otc partner revenue is related to our agreement with pfizer inc formerly wyeth with respect to supply of over the counter pharmaceutical products and related research and development services 
we initially defer all revenue earned under our otc partner agreement 
we also defer direct product manufacturing costs to the extent these costs are reimbursable by the otc partner 
we recognize the product manufacturing costs in excess of amounts reimbursable by the otc partner as current period cost of revenue 
we recognize revenue as otc partner revenue and amortize deferred product manufacturing costs as cost of revenues as we fulfill our contractual obligations 
revenue is recognized and associated costs are amortized over the alliance and collaboration agreement s term of the arrangement or our expected period of performance  using a modified proportional performance method 
under the modified proportional performance method of revenue recognition utilized by us  the amount we recognize in the period of initial recognition is based upon the number of years elapsed under the alliance and collaboration agreement relative to the estimated total length of the recognition period 
under this method  the amount of revenue we recognize in the year of initial recognition is determined by multiplying the total amount realized by a fraction  the numerator of which is the then current year of the alliance and collaboration agreement and the denominator of which is the total estimated life of the alliance and collaboration agreement 
the amount recognized as revenue during each remaining year is an equal pro rata amount 
finally  cumulative revenue recognized is limited to the extent of cash collected and or the fair value received 
the result of the modified proportional performance method is a greater portion of the revenue is recognized in the initial period with the remaining balance being recognized ratably over either the remaining life of the arrangement or the expected period of performance of the alliance and collaboration agreement 

table of contents research partner 
we have entered into development agreements with unrelated third party pharmaceutical companies under which we are collaborating in the development of four dermatological products  including three generic products and one branded dermatological product  and one branded cns product 
under each of the development agreements  we received an upfront fee with the potential to receive additional milestone payments upon completion of contractually specified clinical and regulatory milestones 
additionally  we may also receive royalty payments from the sale  if any  of a successfully developed and commercialized branded product under one of the development agreements 
we defer and recognize revenue received from the provision of research and development services  including the upfront payment and the milestone payments received before january  on a straight line basis over the expected period of performance of the research and development services 
we will recognize revenue received from the achievement of contingent research and development milestones  if any  after january  currently in the period such payment is earned 
we will recognize royalty fee income  if any  as current period revenue when earned 
promotional partner 
we have entered into a promotional services agreement with an unrelated third party pharmaceutical company under which we provide physician detailing sales calls services to promote certain of the unrelated third party company s branded drug products 
we receive service fee revenue in exchange for providing this service 
we recognize revenue from the provision of physician detailing sales calls as such services are rendered and the performance obligations are met and from contingent payments  if any  at the time they are earned 

table of contents estimated lives of alliance and collaboration agreements 
the revenue we receive under our alliance and collaboration agreements is not subject to adjustment for estimated chargebacks  rebates  product returns and other pricing adjustments as such adjustments are included in the amounts we receive from our alliance partners 
however  because we recognize revenue we receive under our alliance agreements  which is required to be deferred  over the estimated life of the related agreement or our expected performance utilizing either the straight line method or a modified proportional performance method  we are required to estimate the recognition period under each such agreement in order to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized in the current period 
sometimes this estimate is based solely on the fixed term of the particular alliance agreement 
in other cases the estimate may be based on more subjective factors as noted in the following paragraphs 
while changes to the estimated recognition periods have been infrequent  such changes  should they occur  may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
as an illustration  the consideration received from the provision of research and development services under the license  development and commercialization agreement with glaxo group limited gsk  including the up front fee and payments received for manufacturing clinical supplies  will initially be deferred and then recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over our expected period of performance during the development period  which is currently estimated to be the month period ending december  any change in the expected period of performance will be adjusted on a prospective basis 
in this regard  if we were to estimate our period of performance to require significantly more time  then the license  development and commercialization agreement revenue recognition period would be increased on a prospective basis  resulting in a reduced periodic amount of revenue recognized in current and future periods 
additionally  for example  the consideration received from the provision of research and development services under the joint development agreement with medicis  including the up front fee and milestone payments received before january   have been initially deferred and are being recognized on a straight line basis over our expected period of performance to provide research and development services under the joint development agreement which is estimated to be a month period  starting in december  upon receipt of the million upfront payment  and ending in november the completion of the final joint development agreement deliverable represents the end of our estimated expected period of performance  as we will have no further contractual obligation to perform research and development services under the joint development agreement  and therefore the earnings process will be complete 
if the timing of the completion of the research and development services is different from our estimate  the revenue recognition period will change on a prospective basis at such time the event occurs 
while no such change in the estimated life of the joint development agreement has occurred to date  if we were to conclude significantly more time will be required to fulfill our contractual obligations  then we would increase our estimate of the revenue recognition period under the joint development agreement  resulting in a reduced periodic amount of revenue recognized prospectively in current and future periods 

table of contents third party research agreements 
in addition to our own research and development resources  we may use unrelated third party vendors  including universities and independent research companies  to assist in our research and development activities 
these vendors provide a range of research and development services to us  including clinical and bio equivalency studies 
we generally sign agreements with these vendors which establish the terms of each study performed by them  including  among other things  the technical specifications of the study  the payment schedule  and timing of work to be performed 
third party researchers generally earn payments either upon the achievement of a milestone  or on a pre determined date  as specified in each study agreement 
we account for third party research and development expenses as they are incurred according to the terms and conditions of the respective agreement for each study performed  with an accrued expense at each balance sheet date for estimated fees and charges incurred by us  but not yet billed to us 
we monitor aggregate actual payments and compare them to the estimated provisions to assess the reasonableness of the accrued expense balance at each quarterly balance sheet date 
differences between our estimates and actual payments made have not been significant 
share based compensation 
we recognize the grant date fair value of each option and restricted share over its vesting period 
options and restricted shares granted under the plan vest over a three or four year period and have a term of ten years 
we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the grant date using the black scholes merton option pricing model  wherein expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock  and of a peer group for the period of time our common stock was deregistered  over the period commensurate with the expected term of the stock options 
we base the expected term calculation on the simplified method described in sab no 
 share based payment and sab no 
 share based payment  because it provides a reasonable estimate in comparison to our actual experience 
we base the risk free interest rate on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for an instrument with a maturity that is commensurate with the expected term of the stock options 
the dividend yield is zero as we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock  and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
income taxes 
we are subject to us federal  state and local income taxes and taiwan roc income taxes 
we create a deferred tax asset  or a deferred tax liability  when we have temporary differences between the financial statement carrying values gaap and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities 
fair value of financial instruments 
our cash and cash equivalents include a portfolio of high quality credit securities  including us government sponsored entity securities  treasury bills  corporate bonds  short term commercial paper  and or high rated money market funds 
our entire portfolio matures in less than one year 
the carrying value of the portfolio approximated the market value at december  we carry our deferred compensation liability at fair value  based upon observable market values 
we had no debt outstanding as of december  our only remaining debt instrument at december  was our credit facility with wells fargo bank  na  which would be subject to variable interest rates and principal payments should we decide to borrow under it 
contingencies 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to loss contingencies  such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business  covering a wide range of matters  including  among others  patent litigation  shareholder lawsuits  and product and clinical trial liability 
in accordance with fasb asc topic contingencies  we record accrued loss contingencies when it is probable a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated and we do not recognize gain contingencies until realized 

table of contents goodwill 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  goodwill and other intangibles  rather than recording periodic amortization of goodwill  goodwill is subject to an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
under fasb asc topic  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill  then goodwill is considered not impaired  making further analysis not required 
we attribute the entire carrying amount of goodwill to the global division 
we concluded the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired as of december  and  as the fair value of the global division exceeded its carrying value at each date 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year 
we estimate the fair value of the global division using a discounted cash flow model for both the reporting unit and the enterprise  as well as earnings and revenue multiples per common share outstanding for enterprise fair value 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  we perform a review of our business operations to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could have a material adverse effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  and thus indicate a potential impairment of the goodwill carrying value 
if such events or changes in circumstances were deemed to have occurred  we would perform an interim impairment analysis  which may include the preparation of a discounted cash flow model  or consultation with one or more valuation specialists  to analyze the impact  if any  on our assessment of the reporting unit s fair value 
we have not to date deemed there to be any significant adverse changes in the legal  regulatory or business environment in which we conduct our operations 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview the following table sets forth our summarized  consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and september  september  september  september  year ended in s december december increase decrease total revenues gross profit income from operations income before income taxes provision for income taxes non controlling interest net income net income for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million as compared to million for the year ended december   primarily attributable to a decrease in global product sales  net which was driven by lower revenue from the sale of our tamsulosin product  a generic version of flomax  and decreased rx partner revenues  principally driven by a change in the accounting for the teva agreement in the year ended december   partially offset by a corresponding decrease in the provision for income taxes 
during  sales of our tamsulosin product benefited from an eight week contractual market exclusivity period which commenced on march   and for which there was no similar contractual market exclusivity period in the year ended december  the change in the accounting for the teva agreement resulted in an increase of approximately million to net income in the year ended december  for additional information on the accounting afforded the teva agreement  see item exhibits and financial statement schedules note  alliance and collaboration agreements strategic alliance agreement with teva 
in addition  we continued to earn significant revenues and gross profit from sales of our authorized generic adderall xr products  and fenofibrate products  during the year ended december  with respect to our authorized generic adderall xr products  we are dependent on a third party pharmaceutical company to supply us with the finished product we market and sell through our global division 
we experienced disruptions related to the supply of our authorized generic adderall xr from this third party pharmaceutical company 
any continued delay or interruption in whole or part in the supply of our authorized generic adderall xr products from the third party pharmaceutical company could curtail or delay our product shipments and adversely affect our consolidated revenues  as well as jeopardize our relationships with our customers 
any significant diminution in the consolidated revenue and or gross profit of our authorized generic adderall xr and fenofibrate products  or any of our other products  due to competition and or product supply or any other reasons in future periods may materially and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in such future periods 

table of contents global division the following table sets forth results of operations for the global division for the years ended december  and september  september  september  september  year ended in s december december increase decrease revenues global product sales  net rx partner otc partner research partner total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development patent litigation selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations revenues total revenues for the global division for the year ended december   were million  a decrease of from  principally resulting from the decreases in global product sales  net and rx partner revenue as discussed below 
global product sales  net  were million for the year ended december   a decrease of from the same period in  primarily as a result of lower sales of our tamsulosin product 
we commenced sales of our tamsulosin product  on march  and had a contractual market exclusivity period for this product for the succeeding eight weeks 
as a result  we were able to achieve high market share penetration in following the expiration of our contractual market exclusivity period  competing generic versions to our own generic version of the tamsulosin product began entering the market in april  resulting in both price erosion and reduction of our market share for that product 
rx partner revenues were million for  a decrease of over the prior year attributable to a change in revenue recognition under the teva agreement which increased rx partner revenue by million in the year ended december  rx partner revenues excluding the change in accounting in for the teva agreement increased million in compared to this increase principally resulted from a teva agreement profit share adjustment realized by us in the amount of profit share we receive under the teva agreement is calculated by teva  and is generally based upon estimates of net product sales or gross profit which include estimates of deductions for chargebacks  rebates  product returns  and other adjustments as negotiated by teva with its customers 
we record teva s adjustments to such estimated amounts in the period when earned 
otc partner revenues were million for the year ended december   with the decrease over the prior year resulting from lower sales of our product marketed under our otc partner alliance agreement with pfizer 
research partner revenues were million for the year ended december  an increase of million over the prior year  resulting from the recognition of revenue related to a milestone payment which was earned in the current year 

table of contents cost of revenues cost of revenues was million for the year ended december  and million for the prior year  of which million in was related to the teva agreement change in accounting related to the amortization of deferred manufacturing costs  corresponding to the adjustment to revenue recognition discussed above 
cost of revenues increased million  before the teva agreement change primarily resulting from higher sales of our authorized generic adderall xr products 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or approximately of total revenues  as compared to million  or approximately of total revenue  in the prior year 
gross profit in the current year decreased when compared to gross profit in the prior year period attributed primarily to lower sales of our tamsulosin product in the current year  and the prior year change in revenue recognition under the teva agreement noted above

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our operations with the proceeds from the sale of debt and equity securities  and more recently  with cash from operations 
currently  our principal source of liquidity is cash from operations  consisting of the proceeds from the sales of our products and provision of services 
we expect to incur significant operating expenses  including research and development activities and patent litigation expenses  for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we are generally required to make cash expenditures to manufacture and or acquire finished product inventory in advance of selling the finished product to our customers and collecting payment for such product sales  which may result in significant periodic uses of cash 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances  together with cash expected to be generated from operations  and our bank revolving line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our financing requirements through the next months 
we may  however  seek additional financing through alliance  collaboration  and or licensing agreements  as well as from the equity and or debt capital markets to fund planned capital expenditures  our research and development plans  potential acquisitions  and potential revenue shortfalls due to delays in new product introductions or otherwise

in addition  higher inventory at december  resulted in a million use of cash  while lower inventory levels in the prior year were a million source of cash 
these uses of cash were partially offset by an increase of million in cash flows related to accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year period  was primarily the result of lower sales of our tamsulosin products in the current year as described above 
the decrease in cash provided by inventory in the current year was primarily the result of higher levels of raw material and finished goods as of december  accounts payable and accrued expenses resulted in a million use of cash for the year ended december   which was a million increase as compared to a million use of cash in the prior year 
the large use of cash in the prior year was primarily the result of higher levels of payments to vendors  due primarily to timing  as well as higher income tax payments

the higher level of prepaid and other assets resulted in a million use of cash in the current year  compared to a million source of cash in the prior year  while lower accounts payable and accrued expenses resulted in a year over year decrease of million in cash flows 
the decreased level of accounts receivable at december  was primarily the result of amounts owed by our customers related to sales from the launch of our authorized generic adderall xr products launched in october 
cash provided by operating activities during the current year was also positively impacted by sales from the launch of our tamsulosin product in march  of which we commenced sales with a contractual eight week exclusivity period starting on march   during which time we were able to achieve high market share penetration 
tamsulosin product sales after the contractual exclusivity period noted above did not remain at this level  as additional competing generic versions of the product entered the market in late april at the conclusion of our contractual exclusivity period

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb amended its guidance about fair value measurement and disclosure 
the new guidance was issued in conjunction with a new international financial reporting standards ifrs fair value measurement standard aimed at updating ifrs to conform to us gaap 
the new fasb guidance will result in some additional disclosure requirements  however  it does not result in significant modifications to existing fasb guidance with respect to fair value measurement and disclosure 
we are required to adopt this guidance on january  we are in the process of evaluating this guidance  however  we do not believe it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 presentation of comprehensive income topic  in order to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the amendments provide an entity with the option to present the components of net income  other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income  either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in addition  regardless of which option the entity chooses  the entity is required to present  on the face of the consolidated financial statements  reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
the requirement of this update to present the components of net income  other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income  either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  in december  the requirement to present reclassification adjustments on the face of the consolidated financial statements was deferred indefinitely 
the adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued its updated guidance for the testing of goodwill for impairment 
the update allows us the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if after assessing qualitative factors it is determined that it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we will need to perform a more detailed goodwill impairment test which is used to identify potential goodwill impairments and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment losses to be recognized  if any 
the objective of this new approach is to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
we are in the process of evaluating this guidance 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued its updated guidance on balance sheet offsetting 
this new standard provides guidance to determine when offsetting in the balance sheet is appropriate 
the guidance is designed to enhance disclosures by requiring improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments 
the goal is to provide users of the financial statements the ability to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity s statement of financial position 
this guidance will only impact the disclosures within an entity s financial statements and notes to the financial statements and does not result in a change to the accounting treatment of financial instruments and derivative instruments 
we are required to adopt this guidance on january  we are in the process of evaluating this guidance
