critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenues  inventories  warranty obligations  purchase order commitments  bad debts  deferred income taxes  restructuring liabilities  asset retirement obligations  restructuring  stock based compensation and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have reviewed these policies with our audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the arrangement consideration is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we derive revenue from four sources system sales  spare parts sales  service contracts and license fees 
provided all other criteria are met  we recognize revenues on system sales when system acceptance provisions have been met in accordance with the terms and conditions of the arrangement 
in the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing system acceptance period  we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or system acceptance  whichever occurs first 
in these instances  which are infrequent  revenue is recorded only if the product has met product specifications prior to shipment and management deems that no significant uncertainties as to product performance exist 
our transactions frequently include the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
in transactions with multiple deliverables  revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements and when system acceptance has occurred or we are otherwise released from our system acceptance obligations 
in the first quarter of  we adopted accounting standard update asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multi deliverables revenue arrangements  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified on or subsequent to january  the new standard changed the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price 
implementation of this new authoritative guidance had an insignificant impact on reported revenue as compared to revenue under previous guidance  as the new guidance did not change the units of accounting within sales arrangements and the elimination of the residual method for the allocation of arrangement consideration had an immaterial impact on the amount and timing of reported revenue 
for multiple element arrangements entered into or materially modified on or subsequent to january   the total consideration for an arrangement is allocated among the separate elements in the arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price hierarchy for a deliverable is based on i vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available  ii third party evidence of selling price if vsoe is not available  or iii an estimated selling price  if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
if we have not established vsoe and cannot obtain third party evidence of selling price  we determine our estimate of the relative selling price by considering our production costs and historical margins of similar products or services 
we believe this best represents the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we regularly review the method used to determine our relative selling price and update any estimates accordingly 
we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or other future performance obligations 
for multiple element arrangements entered into prior to january   revenue is allocated among the separate accounting units based on the residual method under which the revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on fair value of such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to delivered elements  provided the delivered elements have value on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements  the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items 
we generally recognize revenue from spare parts sales upon shipment  as our products are generally sold on terms that transfer title and risk of ownership when it leaves our site 
we sell service contracts for which revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period for time based service contracts or as service hours are delivered for contracts based on a purchased quantity of hours 
we recognize license revenue from transactions in which our systems are re sold by our customers to third parties  as well as from royalty arrangements 
costs related to deferred product revenues are capitalized deferred and recognized at the time of revenue recognition 
deferred product revenue and costs are netted on our balance sheet  under the caption deferred product and services income 
the gross amount of deferred revenues and deferred costs at december  were million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million  respectively  at december  costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of sales 
inventories and purchase order commitments the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements and market conditions 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments  when appropriate  to reflect inventory at lower of cost or market 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  product mix or technological developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in the future  if we find that our estimates are too optimistic and we determine that our inventory needs to be reserved  we will be required to recognize such costs in our cost of sales at the time of such determination 
for example  if the demand assumption used in our assessment at december  was reduced by  assuming all other assumptions such as product mix are kept the same and that mitigation efforts were not possible  we would have had to reserve our inventory and open purchase commitments by million 
conversely  if we find our estimates are too pessimistic and we subsequently sell product that has previously been reserved  our gross margin in that period will be favorably impacted 
warranty obligations we recognize the estimated cost of our product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage rates and the efficiency by which the product failure is corrected 
should actual product failure rates  material usage rates and labor efficiencies differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could result in future charges or credits to our gross margins 
we believe our warranty accrual  as of december   will be sufficient to satisfy outstanding obligations as of that date 
allowance for bad debts we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this reserve is established based upon historical trends  current economic conditions  delinquency status based on contractual terms and an analysis of specific exposures 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  or even a single customer was otherwise unable to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the typical selling price of our systems is between million and million 
accordingly  a single customer default could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our bad debt reserve for accounts receivable at december  was million as compared to million at december  deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
asc topic  income taxes asc  provides for recognition of deferred tax assets if the realization of such deferred tax assets is more likely than not to occur 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain the benefit of the reversal of temporary differences  net operating loss carry forwards  and tax credit carry forwards 
each quarter we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
as a result of our analysis  we concluded that it is more likely than not that  as of december   our net deferred tax assets will not be realized  with the exception of those in japan and taiwan 
therefore  we continue to provide a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets outside of japan and taiwan 
management continues to monitor the relative weight of positive and negative evidence of future profitability in relevant jurisdictions 
as of december   we have experienced historical profitability 
however  as of december   we have determined that the following negative evidence outweighs the positive evidence such that it is not more likely than not the company will generate sufficient taxable income in the relevant jurisdictions to utilize our deferred tax assets and release the associated valuation allowance movement of certain product manufacturing to singapore  resulting in reduced us taxable income  inherent earnings volatility of our industry resulting in our inability to forecast long term earnings  and usage limitations resulting in a longer period being required to realize our deferred tax assets 
it is possible that sometime in the next months the positive evidence will be sufficient to release a material amount of our valuation allowance  however there is no assurance that this will occur 
as of december   we had recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million against our net deferred tax assets except for those in japan and taiwan 
as of december   we had recorded approximately million of net foreign deferred tax assets related to our operations in japan and taiwan 
based on projected future pre tax income in japan and taiwan  these assets were not subject to a valuation allowance as it is more likely than not that they will be realized in the future 
stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility  employee stock option exercise behaviors and employee option forfeiture rates 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense recognized in our results of operations could be materially affected 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest  the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of asc  the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
results of operations we derive a substantial portion of our total net sales from sales of a relatively small number of newly manufactured systems  which typically range in price from million to million 
as a result of these high sale prices  the timing and recognition of revenue from a single transaction has had and most likely will continue to have a significant impact on our net sales and operating results for any particular period 
our backlog at the beginning of a period typically does not include all of the sales needed to achieve our sales objectives for that period 
in addition  orders in backlog are subject to cancellation  shipment or system acceptance delays  and deferral or rescheduling by a customer with limited or no penalties 
consequently  our net sales and operating results for a period have been and will continue to be dependent upon our obtaining orders for systems to be shipped and accepted in the same period in which the order is received 
our business and financial results for a particular period could be materially adversely affected if an anticipated order for even one system is not received in time to permit shipment and system acceptance during that period 
furthermore  a substantial portion of our shipments has historically occurred near the end of each quarter 
delays in installation and system acceptance due  for example  to our inability to successfully demonstrate the agreed upon specifications or criteria at the customer s facility  or to the failure of the customer to permit installation of the system in the agreed upon time  may cause net sales in a particular period to fall significantly below our expectations  which may materially adversely affect our operating results for that period 
this risk is especially applicable in connection with the introduction and initial sales of a new product line 
additionally  the failure to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments due  for example  to rescheduling  delays  deferrals or cancellations by customers  additional customer configuration requirements  or to unexpected manufacturing difficulties or delays in deliveries by suppliers due to their long production lead times or otherwise  have caused and may continue to cause net sales in a particular period to fall significantly below our expectations  materially adversely affecting our operating results for that period 
in particular  the long manufacturing and acceptance cycles of our advanced packaging family of wafer steppers and laser thermal processing systems and the long lead time for lenses and other materials  could cause shipments and acceptances of such products to be delayed from one quarter to the next  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for a particular quarter 
additionally  the need for continued expenditures for research and development  capital equipment  ongoing training and worldwide customer service and support  among other factors  will make it difficult for us to reduce our operating expenses in a particular period if we fail to achieve our net sales goals for the period 
net sales in millions v v sales of systems spare parts services licenses total net sales vs 
net sales consist of revenues from systems sales  spare parts sales  services and licensing of technologies 
for the year ended december   systems revenue accounted for approximately of total net sales  and services  licenses and spare parts accounted for the remaining 
system sales increased to million primarily attributable to approximately a increase in the number of units sold in compared to at december   we had approximately million of deferred product and services income resulting from products shipped but not yet accepted  as compared with million at december  the increase was primarily due to the timing differences of installation and system acceptance 
in general  it takes about two to three months to install and complete system acceptance 
the gross amounts of deferred revenues and deferred costs at december  were million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million  respectively  at december  deferred product income is recognized as revenue upon satisfying the contractual obligations for installation and or system acceptance 
deferred services income is recognized as revenue ratably over the contract period for time based service contracts or as purchased services are rendered for contracts based on a purchased quantity of hours 
on a product market application basis  system sales to the semiconductor industry were million for the year ended december   an increase of as compared to million in this increase was primarily due to a volume unit increases in our advanced packaging and laser thermal processing markets 
system sales to the nanotechnology market were million for the year ended december   a increase as compared with sales of million in system sales to the nanotechnology market are highly dependent on customer capacity demand 
sales of spare parts in increased  to million  as compared to million in this increase was mainly due to increased demand for spare parts 
sales from services increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the increase in service revenue was primarily due to more new service contracts that were recognized as revenue in revenues from licensing activities increased to million in as compared with million in primarily due to more systems being sold under a royalty arrangement 
pursuant to our license arrangements  such transactions are subject to a license fee based on units sold 
future revenues from licensing activities  if any  will be contingent upon existing and future licensing arrangements 
we may not be successful in generating licensing revenues and do not anticipate the recognition of significant levels of licensing income in the future 
for the year ended december   international net sales were million  or of total net sales  as compared with million  or of total net sales in although international sales increased million from the prior year  the decrease as a percentage of total sales was primarily due to increased us sales of million related to i increased sales to a significant domestic customer  and ii increased sales to two foreign customers with operations in the united states 
we expect sales to international customers to continue to represent a significant majority of our revenues during as companies continue to build manufacturing plants overseas  especially in asia 
our revenue derived from sales in foreign countries is not generally subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations  principally because sales contracts for our systems are generally denominated in us dollars 
in japan  however  orders are often denominated in japanese yen 
for the year ended december   we recorded no system sales in japan 
however  we do sell spare parts into japan and this subjects us to the risk of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the period between when an order is received and when it is recorded as revenue 
after recording revenue  we use various mechanisms  such as natural hedges  to offset substantial portions of the gains or losses associated with our japanese yen denominated receivables due to exchange rate fluctuations 
we had approximately million of japanese yen denominated receivables at december  international sales expose us to a number of additional risks  including fluctuations in the value of local currencies relative to the us dollar  which impact the relative cost of ownership of our products and  thus  the customer s willingness to purchase our product 
see risk factors international sales 
vs 
for the year ended december   systems revenue accounted for approximately of total net sales  and services  licenses and spare parts accounted for the remaining 
system sales increased to million primarily attributable to a increase in the average selling price of systems sold in compared to  a increase in system unit volume and a change in product mix primarily resulting from improved volume increases from laser thermal processing tools 
at december   we had approximately million of deferred product and services income resulting from products shipped but not yet accepted  as compared with million at december  the increase was primarily due to the timing differences of shipment and acceptance 
the gross amounts of deferred revenues and deferred costs at december  were million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million  respectively  at december  on a product market application basis  system sales to the semiconductor industry were million for the year ended december   an increase of as compared to million in this increase was primarily due to a million increase in sales to the laser thermal processing market 
system sales to the nanotechnology market were million for the year ended december   a increase as compared with sales of million in sales of spare parts in increased  to million  as compared to million in this increase was mainly due to increased spare part usage 
sales from services increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the increase in service revenue was primarily due to more new service contracts that were recognized as revenue in revenues from licensing activities increased to million in as compared with million in primarily due to more systems being sold under a royalty arrangement 
for the year ended december   international net sales were million  or of total net sales  as compared with million  or of total net sales in for the year ended december   we recorded no system sales in japan 
we had approximately million of japanese yen denominated receivables at december  gross profit vs 
on a comparative basis  gross margins were and for and  respectively 
the one percentage point increase in gross margin from was primarily due to a favorable change in product mix and unit volume increases in all product lines 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales has been and most likely will continue to be significantly affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of products sold  the introduction of new products  which typically have higher manufacturing  installation and after sale support costs until efficiencies are realized and which are typically discounted more than existing products until the products gain market acceptance  the rate of capacity utilization  write downs of inventory and open purchase commitments  product discounts  pricing and competition in our targeted markets  non linearity of shipments during the quarter which can result in manufacturing inefficiencies  and the percentage of international sales  which typically have lower gross margins than domestic sales principally due to higher field service and support costs 
vs 
on a comparative basis  gross margins were and for and  respectively 
the four percentage point increase in gross margin in was primarily due to an increase in the average selling prices of systems sold and unit volume increases in the laser thermal processing market 
research  development and engineering expenses in millions v v research  development and engineering expenses of revenue an inherent delay exists between the time product development activities and expenditures occur and when resultant product revenue is ultimately realized 
we expect current year research  development and engineering program investments to contribute to revenue in future years 
vs research  development and engineering expenses in increased to million as compared to million in the million increase was primarily due to i higher salary and compensation related expenses of million resulting from our executive bonus plan and new hires  ii an increase of million from higher materials expenses  iii a million increase in outside services  iv a million increase in stock based compensation expense  v a million increase in contributions to fund external research projects  and vi an increase of million in travel related expense 
these increases were partially offset by i million in reduced expenses related to facilities costs  and ii a decrease in engineering expense related to manufacturing support for the period 
as a percentage of net sales  engineering expenses for the year ended december  were compared to for this decrease was due primarily to the increase in net sales as compared to discussed above 
vs 
research  development and engineering expenses in increased to million as compared to million in this increase was primarily due to higher salary and compensation related expenses of i million resulting from executive bonus plan  new hires compensation  and discontinuing salary reduction programs from the prior year  ii million higher travel related expenses and outside services 
these increases were partially offset by million in reduced expenses related to management expense reduction programs 
as a percentage of net sales  engineering expenses for the year ended december  were compared to for this decrease was due primarily to the increase in net sales as compared to as discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses in millions v v selling  general and administrative expenses of revenue vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in  as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to i million of stock based compensation expense  ii a million increase in salaries expense  of which million was non recurring in nature  iii a million increase of external services costs  iv a million increase in travel related expense  v a million increase in sales commission expense  and vi a million increase in bad debt expense  partially offset by a reduction in property taxes of million compared to as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were compared to for this decrease was due primarily to the increase in net sales as compared to vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in  as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to i increased salary and compensation related expenses of million of new hire compensation and million from discontinuing salary reduction programs from the prior year  ii a million increase in stock based compensation expense  iii a million increase of external service costs  iv a million increase in travel related expense  v a million increase related to our management incentive plan  and vi a million increase in sales expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were compared to for this decrease was due primarily to the increase in net sales as compared to interest and other income  net in millions interest income other income expense  net interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  was million for the year ended december   as compared with million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease for all years presented was primarily due to lower interest rates on our investments 
we presently maintain an investment portfolio with a weighted average maturity less than a year 
consequently  changes in short term interest rates have a significant impact on our interest income 
future changes in short term interest rates are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our interest income 
other income expense  net  was unchanged at million for the year ended december  and  as compared with other income of million for in  other expense of million was the loss from foreign currency exchange 
the decrease in in other income was primarily attributable to the recognition of a foreign consumption tax incentive totaling million during  partially offset by a loss from foreign currency exchange of million resulting from the depreciation of japanese yen and loss on equipment disposal of million 
the foreign consumption tax incentive related to a benefit we received in fiscal years and and was previously reserved due to uncertainties as to the ultimate realization of the incentive 
in  we determined that those uncertainties had been sufficiently reduced to allow recognition of the benefit 
we do not expect to recognize any additional benefit with respect to this tax incentive 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded income tax expense of million as compared to income tax expense of million and income tax benefit of  respectively  in and the income tax expense recorded in was comprised primarily of federal taxes of million  state taxes of million and foreign taxes of million accrued on worldwide income 
the income tax expense recorded in was comprised primarily of federal and foreign tax expense while the income tax benefit recorded in was comprised primarily of foreign taxes offset by federal tax benefits 
the actual expense or benefit recorded for the years ending   and differs from the federal tax expense at primarily due to current tax expense in foreign jurisdictions and the fact that the prior year us losses were utilized 
we are eligible for tax incentives that provide that certain income earned in singapore would be subject to a tax holiday and or reduced tax rates for a limited period of time under the laws of singapore 
to realize these benefits  we must meet certain requirements relating to employment and investment activities 
this exemption is expected to expire within years 
in  the tax benefit attributable to the tax holiday was approximately million with a impact on diluted earnings per share 
in  the tax benefit attributable to the tax holiday was approximately million with a impact on diluted earnings per share 
we did not have any benefits attributable to tax holidays in our ability to realize benefits from these initiatives could be materially adversely affected if  among other things  applicable requirements are not met  the incentives are substantially modified  or if we incur losses for which we cannot take a deduction 
income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether  and within which jurisdictions  future earnings will occur and how  when and if cash is repatriated to the united states  combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy 
additionally  taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items  and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws  rules and regulations  each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters and we do not anticipate any material earnings impact from their ultimate resolutions 
in accordance with asc  we had unrecognized benefits of million as of december  due to uncertain tax positions 
we continue to recognize interest and penalties as a component of income tax provision and accrued an immaterial amount for these items for the year 
during the year ended december   the balance related to uncertain tax positions increased by million 
over the next twelve months  we expect an immaterial decline in the estimated amount of liabilities associated with our uncertain tax positions which arose prior to december  as a result of expiring statutes of limitations 
if we are able to eventually recognize these uncertain tax positions  million of the unrecognized benefit on january  and million of the unrecognized benefit on december   would reduce our effective tax rate 
we currently have a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax asset which would impact the timing of the effective tax rate benefit should any of these uncertain tax positions be favorably settled in the future 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
as of december   we had accrued an immaterial amount of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
each quarter we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
as a result of our analysis  and as further described in the critical accounting policies and estimates section  deferred income taxes  we concluded that it is more likely than not that  as of december   our net deferred tax assets will not be realized  with the exception of those in japan and taiwan 
therefore  we continue to provide a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets outside of japan and taiwan 
it is possible that sometime in the next months the positive evidence will be sufficient to release a material amount of our valuation allowance  however there is no assurance that this will occur 
we are subject to federal and state tax examination for years forward and forward  respectively  by virtue of the tax attributes carrying forward from those years 
we are also subject to audits in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate for years and forward 
there are no material income tax examinations currently in progress 
outlook the anticipated timing of orders  shipments and system acceptances usually requires that we fill a number of production slots in any given quarter in order to meet our sales targets 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to secure those production orders  or if existing production orders are delayed or cancelled  our results of operations will be materially adversely impacted 
accordingly  we may not be able to achieve or maintain our current or prior level of sales 
we presently expect net sales in to remain flat or decrease approximately from net sales of million 
because our net sales are subject to a number of risks  including risks associated with the market acceptance of our new laser thermal processing product line  delays in system acceptance  intense competition in the capital equipment industry  uncertainty relating to the timing and market acceptance of our products  and the condition of the macro economy and the semiconductor industry and the other risks described in this report  we may not exceed or maintain our current or prior level of net sales for any period in the future 
additionally  we believe that the market acceptance and volume production of our advanced packaging systems  laser thermal processing systems  and our series family of wafer steppers are of critical importance to our future financial results 
at december   these critical systems represented of our backlog 
to the extent that these products do not achieve or maintain significant sales due to difficulties involving manufacturing or engineering  the inability to reduce the current long manufacturing cycles for these products  competition  excess capacity in the semiconductor or nanotechnology device industries  or for any other reason  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   as compared with million for the comparable period in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was attributable to i million of cash generated from operations after adjustments for non cash charges that was partially offset by ii million of cash used from changes in working capital 
the net million of cash used from changes in working capital consisted of i million increase in accounts receivable balances due to increased sales volumes and a large volume of shipments during the last month of the year  ii million of cash used in increased inventory purchases  and iii a million decrease in accounts payable offset by sources of cash from  i a million increase in accrued expenses  ii a million increase in income tax liabilities  iii a million increase in other liabilities  iv a million increase in deferred income  and v a million decrease in prepaid and other assets 
we believe that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycle of certain of our systems  particularly newer products  our inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
currently  we are devoting significant resources to the development  introduction and commercialization of our laser thermal processing systems and to the development of our next generation x lithography technologies 
we currently intend to continue to incur significant operating expenses in the areas of research  development and engineering  manufacturing  and selling  general and administrative costs in order to further develop  produce and support these new products 
additionally  gross profit margins  inventory and capital equipment levels may be adversely impacted in the future by costs associated with the initial production of the laser thermal processing systems and by future generations of our x wafer steppers 
these costs include  but are not limited to  additional manufacturing overhead  costs of demonstration systems and facilities and the establishment of additional after sales support organizations 
additionally  there can be no assurance that operating expenses will not increase  relative to sales  as a result of adding technical  marketing and administrative personnel  among other costs  to support our new products 
if we are unable to achieve significantly increased net sales or if our sales fall below expectations  our cash flow and operating results will be materially adversely affected until  among other factors  costs and expenses can be reduced 
our failure to achieve our sales targets for these new products could result in additional inventory write offs and asset impairment charges  either of which could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million  as compared with net cash provided by investing activities of million for the comparable period in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was attributable to net purchases of short term investments of million and capital expenditures of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december   as compared with million for the comparable period in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was primarily attributable to proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option plans 
our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by our operations 
at december   we had working capital of million 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  net of related borrowings under our line of credit  consisted of million 
as of december   million of our cash  cash equivalents  and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries 
amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation on repatriation to the united states we currently have no plans to repatriate any foreign earnings back to the united states as we believe our cash flows provided by our us operations will meet our future us liquidity needs 
in december  we entered into a line of credit agreement with a brokerage firm replacing a similar arrangement that we had with a different firm 
under the terms of this agreement  we may borrow funds at a cost equal to the current federal funds rate plus basis points ie as of december  
certain of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments secure outstanding borrowings under this facility 
we may borrow up to of our total cash  cash equivalents and investments balance in this brokerage account 
funds are advanced to us under this facility based on pre determined advance rates on the cash and securities held by us in this brokerage account 
this agreement has no set expiration date and there are no loan covenants 
as of december  and  balances of million and million  respectively  were outstanding under this facility  with a related collateral requirement of approximately million and million  respectively  of our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions total less than year years years after years notes payable obligations non cancelable capital lease obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations long term payables asset retirement obligations open purchase order commitments total contractual cash obligations the amounts shown in the table above for open purchase order commitments are primarily related to the purchase of inventories  equipment and leasehold improvements 
we record charges to operations for purchase order commitments we deem in excess of normal operating requirements see critical accounting policies and estimates 
the development and manufacture of new lithography systems and enhancements are highly capital intensive 
in order to be competitive  we believe we must continue to make significant expenditures for capital equipment  sales  service  training and support capabilities  systems  procedures and controls  and expansion of operations and research and development  among many other items 
we expect that cash generated from operations and our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  in the near term  we may continue to utilize existing and future lines of credit  and other sources of financing  in order to maintain our present levels of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
beyond the next twelve months  we may require additional equity or debt financing to address our working capital or capital equipment needs 
in addition  we may seek to raise equity or debt capital at any time that we deem market conditions to be favorable 
additional financing  if needed  may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
we may in the future pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines  technologies or businesses 
future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses and impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  personnel and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
in the event we acquire product lines  technologies or businesses which do not complement our business  or which otherwise do not enhance our sales or operating results  we may incur substantial write offs and higher recurring operating costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that any such acquisition does occur  there can be no assurance as to the effect thereof on our business or operating results 
off balance sheet transactions our off balance sheet transactions consist of certain financial guarantees  both expressed and implied  related to indemnification for product liability  patent infringement and latent product defects 
other than liabilities recorded pursuant to known product defects  at december   we did not record a liability associated with these guarantees  as we have little or no history of costs associated with such indemnification requirements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
foreign currency as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we attempt to hedge most of our japanese yen denominated foreign currency exposures 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the risk that outstanding japanese yen denominated receipts from customers  for actual or forecasted sales of equipment after receipt of customer orders  may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts and natural hedges to offset substantial portions of the potential gains or losses associated with our japanese yen denominated assets and liabilities due to exchange rate fluctuations 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of nine months or less 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk due to potential changes in interest rates  relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted primarily of fixed interest rate instruments as of december  and we maintain an investment policy designed to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting market risk and the risk of default 
certain of our cash  cash equivalents and investments serve as collateral for a line of credit we maintain with a brokerage firm 
the line of credit is used for liquidity purposes  mitigating the need to liquidate investments in order to meet our current operating cash requirements 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in the financial instruments held by us at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
these instruments are comprised of cash equivalents and investments 
these instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
the modeling techniques used measure the change in fair values arising from selected hypothetical changes in interest rates 
assumed market value changes to our portfolio reflects immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps cash equivalents and available for sale investments  in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points no change in interest rate valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps bps bps bps commercial paper money market funds us corporate debt securities us treasury bills and notes securities and obligations of us government agencies total investments during  we did not materially alter our investment objectives or criteria and believe that  although the composition of our portfolio has changed from the preceding year  the portfolio s sensitivity to changes in interest rates is materially the same 
credit risk we mitigate credit default risk by attempting to invest in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and is diversified in accordance with our investment policy 
to date  we have not experienced significant liquidity problems with our portfolio 
our single largest holding at december   excluding the us government and its agencies  was a million money market fund 
as of december   we did not have any investments in mortgage backed or auction rate securities or any security investments in the financial service sector 
however  we intend to closely monitor developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as deemed necessary or advisable 
based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio and our expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of the current credit environment 
foreign exchange risk the majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into these transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we have established cash flow and balance sheet hedging programs 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the risk that outstanding japanese yen denominated receipts from customers for actual or forecasted sales of equipment may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of currency movements
