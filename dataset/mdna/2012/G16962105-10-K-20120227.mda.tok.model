item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
operating results factors affecting operating results bunge limited  a bermuda company  together with its subsidiaries is a leading global agribusiness and food company operating in the farm to consumer food chain 
our results of operations are affected by key factors in each of our business segments as discussed below 
agribusiness in the agribusiness segment  we purchase  store  transport  process and sell agricultural commodities and commodity products 
profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and market prices of agricultural commodities and processed commodity products and the availability and costs of energy  transportation and logistics services 
profitability in our oilseed processing operations is also impacted by capacity utilization rates 
availability of agricultural commodities is affected by many factors  including weather  farmer planting decisions  plant disease  governmental policies and 
table of contents agricultural sector economic conditions 
demand for our purchased and processed agribusiness products is affected by many factors  including global and regional economic conditions  including changes in per capita incomes  the financial condition of customers  including customer access to credit  worldwide consumption of food products  particularly pork and poultry  changes in population growth rates  the relative prices of substitute agricultural products  outbreaks of disease associated with livestock and poultry  and  in the past few years  by demand for renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities and commodity products 
we expect that the factors described above will continue to affect global supply and demand for our agribusiness products 
we also expect that  from time to time  imbalances may exist between oilseed processing capacity and demand for oilseed products in certain regions  which impacts our decisions regarding whether  when and where to purchase  store  transport  process or sell these commodities  including whether to change the location of or adjust our own oilseed processing capacity 
sugar and bioenergy our sugar and bioenergy segment is an integrated business including the procurement and growing of sugarcane and the production of sugar  ethanol and electricity in our eight mills in brazil  five of which were acquired in february in the moema acquisition  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  our global sugar trading and merchandising activities and our minority interests in us corn based ethanol producers 
profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and quality of sugarcane  which impacts our capacity utilization rates  and by market prices of sugarcane  sugar and ethanol 
availability and quality of sugarcane is affected by many factors  including weather  geographical factors  such as soil quality and topography  and agricultural practices 
once planted  sugarcane may be harvested for several continuous years  but the usable crop decreases with each subsequent harvest 
as a result  the current optimum economic cycle is generally five or six consecutive harvests  depending on location 
we own and have partnership agreements for land on which we grow and harvest sugarcane and we also purchase sugarcane from third parties 
prices of sugarcane in brazil are established by consecana  the s o paulo state sugarcane and sugar and ethanol council  based on the sucrose content of the cane and the market prices of sugar and ethanol 
demand for our products is affected by many factors  including changes in global or regional economic conditions  the financial condition of customers  including customer access to credit  worldwide consumption of food products  changes in population growth rates  changes in per capita incomes  and demand for and governmental support of renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities  including sugarcane 
we expect that the factors described above will continue to affect supply and demand for our sugar and bioenergy products 
food and ingredients in the food and ingredients division  which consists of our edible oil products and milling products segments  our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials  such as crude vegetable oils and grains  the mix of products we sell  changes in eating habits  changes in per capita incomes  consumer purchasing power levels  availability of credit to commercial customers  governmental dietary guidelines and policies  changes in general economic conditions and competitive environment in our markets 
fertilizer in the fertilizer segment  demand for our products is affected by the profitability of the agricultural sectors we serve  the availability of credit to farmers  agricultural commodity prices  international fertilizer prices  the types of crops planted  the number of acres planted  the quality of the land under cultivation and weather related issues affecting the success of the harvest 
in addition  our profitability is impacted by international selling prices for imported fertilizers and fertilizer raw materials  such as phosphate  sulfur  ammonia and urea  ocean freight rates and other import fees 
due to our significant operations in south america  our results in this segment are typically seasonal  with fertilizer sales normally concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to the timing of the agricultural cycle 
in addition to the above industry related factors which impact our business divisions  our results of operations are affected by the following factors 
table of contents foreign currency exchange rates due to the global nature of our operations  our operating results can be materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates 
both translation of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements and foreign currency transactions can affect our results 
on a monthly basis  for subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency subsidiary statements of income and cash flows are translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes based on weighted average exchange rates during the monthly period 
as a result  fluctuations of local currencies compared to the us dollar during a monthly period impact our consolidated statements of income and cash flows for that period and also affect comparisons between periods 
subsidiary balance sheets are translated using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
included in accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended december   and were foreign exchange net translation gains losses of  million  million and  million  respectively  resulting from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities 
additionally  we record transaction gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity 
these amounts are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date  with the resulting gains or losses included in the entity s statement of income and  therefore  in our consolidated statements of income as a foreign exchange gain loss 
we primarily use a combination of equity and intercompany loans to finance our subsidiaries 
intercompany loans that are of an investment nature with no intention of repayment in the foreseeable future are considered permanently invested and as such are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
as a result  any foreign exchange translation gains or losses on such permanently invested intercompany loans are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
in contrast  foreign exchange translation gains or losses on intercompany loans that are not of a permanent nature are recorded in our consolidated statements of income as a foreign exchange gain loss 
income taxes as a bermuda exempted company  we are not subject to income taxes on income in our jurisdiction of incorporation 
however  our subsidiaries  which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions  are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates ranging from to 
the jurisdictions that most significantly impact our effective tax rate are brazil  the united states and argentina 
determination of taxable income requires the interpretation of related and often complex tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we operate and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events 
results of operations overview net income attributable to bunge for was million compared to  million for  which included the gain on the sale of our brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets in may of  million 
total segment ebit of  million declined from  million in  which included the pretax gain of  million on the sale of our brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets and million of expenses related to make whole payments in connection with the repayment of debt 
agribusiness segment ebit increased driven by improved grain origination and oilseed processing results 
grain origination results were weighted to the first half of and benefited from a large south american harvest 
oilseed processing results improved significantly over driven by stronger results in europe and brazil as both areas benefited from better crops  particularly the improvement in european sunflower seed following a drought in eastern europe 
oilseed processing operations in north america and asia continued to face challenging environments due to excess capacity 
volumes in the segment increased  reflecting larger eastern european crops  the 
table of contents impact of the expansion of our grain origination network  primarily in north america  and the expansion of our oilseed processing operations in asia 
additionally  a gain of million was recognized on the sale of our interest in a european oilseed processing facility joint venture during impairment and restructuring charges of million were recorded in sugar and bioenergy segment ebit declined to million compared to million in as higher gross margins were offset by higher sg a and the impact of foreign exchange results related to derivatives hedging forward sales commitments 
industrial performance improved significantly compared to but continued to be impacted by the higher fixed cost absorption resulting from reduced capacity utilization due to the effects of the drought and adverse weather in on sugarcane yields and quality 
the improvements in our industrial operations were more than offset by weak results in our sugar merchandising business when compared to and foreign exchange losses of million in  compared with million of gains in driven by volatility of the brazilian real relative to the us dollar 
transaction fees of million and restructuring charges of million were recorded in in the food and ingredients division  edible oil products segment ebit increased to million in from million in impairment and restructuring charges of million and a provision of million related to expiring tax credits in brazil were recorded in the edible oil products segment in the remaining increase in segment ebit resulted from strong packaged oil margins  primarily in north america  resulting from improved pricing and product mix and a million gain in on the sale of an idled canadian facility 
milling products segment ebit increased to million from million in primarily as a result of improved margins in corn milling resulting from better milling yields and effective risk management 
rice milling operations also contributed to improved results 
a gain of million related to the sale of an idled wheat milling facility in brazil and impairment and restructuring charges of million related primarily to the write down of a long term supply agreement that accompanied a brazil wheat mill acquisition were recorded in fertilizer segment ebit was million in compared to  million in which included the  million gain on the sale of the brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets 
fertilizer blending and distribution margins and volumes improved in as our brazilian operations continued to transition following the sale of our brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets in and our argentine business continued to perform well 
restructuring charges of million were recorded in segment results in the first quarter of  bunge began reporting the results of its sugar and bioenergy businesses as a reportable segment 
prior to  sugar and bioenergy results and assets were included in the agribusiness segment 
accordingly  amounts for have been reclassified to conform to the current period segment presentation 
bunge has five reportable segments agribusiness  sugar and bioenergy  edible oil products  milling products and fertilizer which are organized based upon similar economic characteristics and are similar in nature of products and services offered  the nature of production processes  the type and class of customer and distribution methods 
the agribusiness segment is characterized by both inputs and outputs being agricultural commodities and thus high volume and low margin 
the sugar and bioenergy segment involves sugarcane growing and milling in brazil  sugar merchandising in various countries  as well as sugarcane based ethanol production and corn based ethanol investments and related activities 
the edible oil products segment involves the manufacturing and marketing of products derived from vegetable oils 
the milling products segment involves the manufacturing and marketing of products derived primarily from wheat and corn 
following the completion of the sale of our brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets in may  the activities of the fertilizer segment include its fertilizer distribution business in brazil as well as its operations in argentina and the united states see note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we have retained our interest in the fertilizer joint venture in morocco

table of contents year ended december  us in millions depreciation  depletion and amortization agribusiness sugar and bioenergy edible oil products milling products fertilizer total net income attributable to bunge total segment earnings before interest and tax ebit is an operating performance measure used by bunge s management to evaluate its segments operating activities 
total segment ebit is a non gaap financial measure and is not intended to replace net income attributable to bunge  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
bunge s management believes segment ebit is a useful measure of its segments operating profitability  since the measure allows for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to its financing methods or capital structure 
in addition  ebit is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in bunge s industries 
total segment ebit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to bunge or any other measure of consolidated operating results under us gaap

in  we recorded income tax expense of million compared to million in the effective tax rate for was compared to in the lower effective tax rate for resulted primarily from lower taxable income in higher tax jurisdictions  particularly brazil 
the effective tax rate for resulted primarily from the tax impact of the gain on the brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets sale in the second quarter of included in our income tax expense for was million of taxes on the gain from the brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets sale 
also included was million of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets which we do not expect to fully recover prior to their expiration and million of tax expense related to the new thin capitalization tax legislation that was enacted in brazil in september  which denies income tax deductions for interest payments with respect to certain debt to the extent a company s debt to equity ratio exceeds a certain threshold or the debt is with related parties located in a tax haven jurisdiction as defined under the law 
net income attributable to bunge 
net income attributable to bunge was million compared to  million in which included the  million gain on the sale of the brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets 
compared to agribusiness segment 
agribusiness segment net sales increased due primarily to higher agricultural commodity prices when compared to volumes decreased by from due to lower grain origination and oilseed processing volumes in europe as a severe drought and export restrictions in eastern europe reduced volumes  which were partially offset by strong demand from china in the first half of and higher south american volumes compared to when south american crops were reduced due to adverse weather conditions 
cost of goods sold increased primarily due to higher agricultural commodity prices when compared to cost of goods sold in included million in impairment and restructuring charges primarily related to the write down of an oilseed processing and refining facility in europe and the closure of an older  less efficient north american oilseed processing facility

sugar and bioenergy segment 
sugar and bioenergy segment net sales increased when compared to due to the expansion of our sugar and ethanol production activities in brazil  driven by our acquisition of the moema mills 
the increased net sales also reflect increased sugar and ethanol prices in volumes increased  mainly from this expansion of our sugar industrial business 
cost of goods sold increased due to a number of factors  including the moema acquisition and increased prices of sugarcane 
in addition  cost of goods sold includes the impact of the severe drought which reduced the availability and quality of sugarcane for production 
the impact of operating our facilities below capacity  including losses from settlement of certain forward contracts for which we did not have sufficient sugar production to meet related delivery obligations and higher fixed cost absorption  increased cost of goods sold 
further  the drought impact includes a charge for the loss of portions of our growing sugarcane 
increased costs and start up challenges related to construction and expansion at certain of our mills also contributed to the increase 
the unfavorable impact of a weaker us dollar on the translation of local currency costs to us dollars also contributed to the increase 
gross profit increased to million in from million in primarily as a result of the increased volumes from acquisition of the moema mills and improved margins in our sugar trading and merchandising business  largely offset by the impact of a drought in our primary sugarcane growing areas in brazil and increased costs incurred in connection with construction and expansion projects at two mills that were completed in the fourth quarter of sg a expenses increased to million in from million in primarily due to the addition of the moema mills and the related expansion of our industrial operations

table of contents financing arrangements and outstanding indebtedness 
we conduct most of our financing activities through a centralized financing structure that enables us and our subsidiaries to borrow more efficiently 
this structure includes a master trust facility  the primary assets of which consist of intercompany loans made to bunge limited and its subsidiaries 
certain of bunge limited s owned finance subsidiaries  bunge limited finance corp  bunge finance europe bv and bunge asset funding corp  fund the master trust with short and long term debt obtained from third parties  including through our commercial paper program and certain credit facilities  as well as the issuance of senior notes 
borrowings by these finance subsidiaries carry full  unconditional guarantees by bunge limited 
revolving credit facilities 
at december   we had approximately  million of aggregate committed borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities  of which  was unused and available 
the following table summarizes these facilities as of the periods presented total availability borrowings outstanding commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities maturities december  december  december  us in millions commercial paper long term revolving credit facilities total borrowings under the revolving credit facilities that have maturities greater than one year from the date of the consolidated balance sheets are classified as long term debt  consistent with the long term maturity of the underlying facilities 
however  individual borrowings under the revolving credit facilities are generally short term in nature  bear interest at variable rates and can be repaid or renewed as each such individual borrowing matures 
our commercial paper program is supported by committed back up bank credit lines the liquidity facility equal to the amount of the commercial paper program provided by lending institutions that are rated at least a by standard poor s and p by moody s investor services 
in november  the liquidity facility was amended to extend the expiration date of the banks commitments to november  and to increase the total commitments under the liquidity agreement from million to million 
the cost of borrowing under the liquidity facility would typically be higher than the cost of borrowing under our commercial paper program 
facility financing fees of million were paid at inception of the credit agreement and are amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis over the agreement s five year term 
at december   million was outstanding under the commercial paper program 
on february   moody s investor services placed the credit ratings of certain financial institutions on negative credit watch 
among the affected institutions are three banks with an aggregate commitment of million under our million liquidity facility  which requires that participating banks carry a short term credit rating of at least a by standard poor s and p by moody s investor services 
if these banks short term credit ratings are downgraded below p by moody s  the affected banks participation in the liquidity facility would have to be terminated  which would have the effect of reducing the maximum aggregate amount of commercial paper and or direct borrowings that can be outstanding under the liquidity facility by the amount of the downgraded banks commitments  unless we are able to replace the downgraded banks with other lenders that meet the minimum ratings criteria 
in november  we entered into an unsecured billion revolving credit facility which matures on november  this credit facility replaced the then existing billion three year revolving credit agreement that had been scheduled to mature on june   which was terminated in

facility financing fees of approximately million were paid at inception of the credit agreement and are amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis over the three year term 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement at december  in addition to the committed facilities above  from time to time  we enter into uncommitted short term credit lines as necessary based on our liquidity requirements 
at december  and  million and  million  respectively  was outstanding under these uncommitted short term credit lines 
short and long term debt 
our short and long term debt decreased by million at december  from december   primarily due to lower working capital levels 
for the year ended december   our average short and long term debt outstanding was approximately billion compared to billion for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from higher commodity prices 
generally  our borrowings increase in times of rising commodity prices as we borrow to acquire inventory and fund margin calls on our short futures positions hedging physical inventories

credit ratings 
bunge s debt ratings and outlook by major credit rating agency at december  were as follows short term debt long term debt outlook standard poor s a bbb stable moody s p baa stable fitch not rated bbb negative our debt agreements do not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate maturity of our debt 
however  credit rating downgrades would increase our borrowing costs under our credit facilities and  depending on their severity  could impede our ability to obtain credit facilities or access the capital markets in the future on favorable terms 
a significant increase in our borrowing costs could impair our ability to compete effectively in our business relative to competitors with higher credit ratings 
our credit facilities and certain senior notes require us to comply with specified financial covenants  including minimum net worth  minimum current ratio  a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and limitations on secured indebtedness 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  interest rate swap agreements 
we may use interest rate swaps as hedging instruments and record the swaps at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded contemporaneously in earnings 
additionally  the carrying amount of the associated debt is adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value due to changes in benchmark interest rates 
ineffectiveness  as defined in asc topic derivatives and hedging  is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset

our total shareholders equity was  million at december   as set forth in the following table december  us in millions equity convertible perpetual preference shares common shares additional paid in capital retained earnings accumulated other comprehensive income treasury shares  at cost  total bunge shareholders equity noncontrolling interest total equity total bunge shareholders equity decreased to  million at december  from  million at december  the change in equity was primarily due to foreign currency translation losses of  million  treasury shares acquired for million and declared dividends to common and preferred shareholders of million and million  respectively  partially offset by net income attributable to bunge for the year ended december  of million 

table of contents noncontrolling interest increased to million at december  from million at december  due primarily to capital contributions totaling million by noncontrolling interest holders  partially offset by dividends of million to noncontrolling interests and a net redemption valued at million by certain third party investors in a private investment fund consolidated by bunge 
of the contributions from noncontrolling interest holders  million were related to joint venture operations that have been in process of construction or expansion and bunge made proportionate contributions  resulting in no changes in ownership percentages related to these entities 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a joint venture to manage a crushing and refining operation in canada 
bunge has a controlling interest in the joint venture and made a capital contribution of million 
on december   bunge s cumulative mandatory convertible preference shares were converted to  common shares pursuant to the terms of the instrument governing these securities 
bunge utilized  treasury shares acquired as a result of repurchases made under bunge s share repurchase program and issued  common shares to satisfy the mandatory conversion 
at december   we had  cumulative convertible perpetual preference shares outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of million 
each convertible perpetual preference share has an initial liquidation preference of  which will be adjusted for any accumulated and unpaid dividends 
the convertible perpetual preference shares carry an annual dividend rate of per share 
dividends are cumulative and are payable quarterly in arrears 
as a result of adjustments made to the initial conversion price because cash dividends paid on bunge limited s common shares exceeded certain specified thresholds  each convertible perpetual preference share is convertible  at the holder s option  at any time into approximately bunge limited common shares  based on the conversion price of per share  subject to certain additional anti dilution adjustments 
at any time on or after december   if the closing price of our common shares equals or exceeds of the conversion price for trading days during any consecutive trading days including the last trading day of such period  we may elect to cause the convertible perpetual preference shares to be automatically converted into bunge limited common shares at the then prevailing conversion price 
the convertible preference shares are not redeemable by us at any time

trade receivables securitization programs in january  we adopted certain amendments to asc topic transfers and servicings that resulted in amounts outstanding under our then existing securitization programs being accounted for as secured borrowings and reflected as short term debt in our consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of this change in accounting standards  we significantly reduced our utilization of these programs and either terminated or allowed them to expire during on june   we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a trade receivables securitization program the program with a financial institution  as administrative agent  and certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers collectively  the purchasers that provides for funding up to million against receivables sold into the program 
the securitization program is designed to enhance our financial flexibility by providing an additional source of liquidity for our operations 
in connection with the securitization program  certain of our us and us subsidiaries that originate trade receivables may sell eligible receivables in their entirety on a revolving basis to a 
table of contents consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity  bunge securitization bv bsbv formed under the laws of the netherlands 
bsbv in turn sells such purchased trade receivables to the administrative agent acting on behalf of the purchasers pursuant to a receivables transfer agreement 
in connection with these sales of accounts receivable  we receive a portion of the proceeds up front and an additional amount upon the collection of the underlying receivables a deferred purchase price  which is expected to be generally between and percent of the aggregate amount of receivables sold through the program 
bunge finance bv bfbv  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  acts as master servicer  responsible for servicing and collecting the accounts receivable for the securitization program 
the securitization program terminates on june  however  each committed purchaser s commitment to fund trade receivables under the securitization program will terminate on may  unless extended for additional day periods in accordance with the terms of the receivables transfer agreement 
the trade receivables sold under the securitization program are subject to specified eligibility criteria  including eligible currencies and country and obligor concentration limits 
bsbv purchases trade receivables from our originating subsidiaries using i proceeds from the sale of receivables to the administrative agent  ii collections of the deferred purchase price and iii borrowings from bfbv under a revolving subordinated loan facility

our risk of loss following the sale of the accounts receivable is limited to the deferred purchase price  which was million at december  the deferred purchase price will be repaid in cash as receivables are collected  generally within days 
delinquencies and credit losses on accounts receivable sold under the program during were insignificant 
because the cash received up front and the deferred purchase price relate to the sale or ultimate collection of the underlying receivables  and are not subject to significant risks  other than credit risk  given their short term nature  we have reflected all cash flows under the securitization program as operating cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december   including changes in the fair value of the deferred purchase price of million 
brazilian farmer credit background we advance funds to farmers  primarily in brazil  through secured advances to suppliers and prepaid commodity purchase contracts 
we also sell fertilizer to farmers  primarily in brazil  on credit as described below 
all of these activities are generally intended to be short term in nature 
the ability of our customers and suppliers to repay these amounts is affected by agricultural economic conditions in the relevant geography  which are  in turn  affected by commodity prices  currency exchange rates  crop input costs and crop quality and yields 
as a result  these arrangements are typically secured by the farmer s crop and  in many cases  the farmer s land and other assets 
on occasion  brazilian farm economics in certain regions and certain years  particularly and  have been adversely affected by factors including volatility in soybean prices  a steadily appreciating brazilian real and poor crop quality and yields 
as a result  certain farmers have defaulted on amounts owed 
while brazilian farm economics have improved  some brazilian farmers continue to face economic challenges due to high debt levels and a strong brazilian real 
upon farmer default  we generally initiate legal proceedings to recover the defaulted amounts 
however  the legal recovery process through the judicial system is a long term process  generally spanning a number of years 
as a 
table of contents result  once accounts have been submitted to the judicial process for recovery  we may also seek to renegotiate certain terms with the defaulting farmer in order to accelerate recovery of amounts owed 
in addition  we have tightened our credit policies to reduce exposure to higher risk accounts and have increased collateral requirements for certain customers 
because brazilian farmer credit exposures are denominated in local currency  reported values are impacted by movements in the value of the brazilian real when translated into us dollars 
from december  to december   the brazilian real devalued by approximately  decreasing the reported farmer credit exposure balances when translated into us dollars 
brazilian fertilizer trade accounts receivable in our brazilian fertilizer operations  customer accounts receivable are intended to be short term in nature  and are expected to be repaid either in cash or through delivery to bunge of agricultural commodities when the related crop is harvested 
as the farmer s cash flow is seasonal and is typically generated after the crop is harvested  the actual due dates of the accounts receivable are individually determined based upon when a farmer purchases our fertilizer and the anticipated date for the harvest and sale of the farmer s crop 
these receivables may also be secured by the farmer s crop 
we initiate legal proceedings against customers to collect amounts owed which are in default 
in some cases  we have renegotiated amounts that were in legal proceedings  including to secure the subsequent year s crop 
we periodically evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable and record allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful 
we base our determination of the allowance on analyses of credit quality of individual accounts  considering also the economic and financial condition of the farming industry and other market conditions as well as the value of any collateral related to amounts owed 
we continuously review defaulted farmer receivables for impairment on an individual account basis 
we consider all accounts in legal collections processes to be defaulted and past due 
for such accounts  we determine the allowance for uncollectible amounts based on the fair value of the associated collateral  net of estimated costs to sell 
for all renegotiated accounts current and past due  we consider changes in farm economic conditions and other market conditions  our historical experience related to renegotiated accounts and the fair value of collateral in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition to our fertilizer trade accounts receivable  we issue guarantees to third parties in brazil relating to amounts owed these third parties by certain of our customers 
these guarantees are discussed under the heading guarantees

secured advances to suppliers and prepaid commodity contracts 
we purchase soybeans through prepaid commodity purchase contracts advance cash payments to suppliers against contractual obligations to deliver specified quantities of soybeans in the future and secured advances to suppliers advances to suppliers against commitments to deliver soybeans in the future  primarily in brazil 
these financing arrangements are typically secured by the farmer s future crop and mortgages on the farmer s land  buildings and equipment  and are generally settled after the farmer s crop is harvested and sold 
interest earned on secured advances to suppliers of million  million and million for  and  respectively  is included in net sales in the consolidated statements of income

the railroad freight services agreements require a minimum monthly payment regardless of the actual level of freight services used by us 
the costs of our freight supply agreements are typically passed through to our customers as a component of the prices we charge for our products 
however  changes in the market value of freight compared to the rates at which we have contracted for freight may affect margins on the sales of agricultural commodities 
does not include estimated payments of liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions 
as of december   bunge had gross unrecognized tax liabilities of million  including related interest and penalties 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities  therefore  such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
does not include obligations for pension and postretirement benefits for which we expect to make employer contributions of million in we also expect to make a significant contribution to our plans in future years 
at december   we had million of contractual commitments related to construction in progress 
in addition  we have entered into partnership agreements for the production of sugarcane 
these agreements have an average life of eight years and cover approximately  hectares of land under cultivation 
amounts owed under these agreements are dependent on several variables including the quantity of sugarcane produced per hectare  the total recoverable sugar trs per ton of sugarcane produced and the price for each kilogram of trs as determined by consecana  the s o paulo state sugarcane and sugar and ethanol council 
in and bunge made payments related to these agreements of million and million  respectively 
of these amounts million and million in and  respectively  were advances for future production and million and million were included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income for and  respectively 
employee benefit plans we expect to contribute million to our defined benefit pension plans and million to our post retirement healthcare benefit plans in critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part iii of this annual report on form k 
allowances for uncollectible accounts accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers are stated at the historical carrying amounts net of write offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts 
we establish an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivable and secured advances to farmers based on historical experience  farming  economic and other market conditions as well as specific identified customer collection issues 
uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount that is less than the outstanding historical balance or when we have determined that collection of the balance is unlikely 
we adopted the accounting guidance on disclosure about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses as of december  this guidance requires information to be disclosed at disaggregated levels  defined as portfolio segments and classes 
based upon its analysis of credit losses and risk factors to be considered in determining the allowance for credit losses  we have determined that the long term receivables from farmers in brazil are a single portfolio segment 
we evaluate this single portfolio segment by class of receivables  which is defined as a level of information below a portfolio segment in which the receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring risk 
we have identified accounts in legal collection processes and renegotiated amounts as classes of long term receivables from farmers 
valuation allowances for accounts in legal collection processes are determined by us on individual accounts based on the fair value of the collateral provided as security for the secured advance or credit sale 
the fair value is determined using a combination of internal and external resources  including published information concerning brazilian land values by region 
for determination of the valuation allowances for renegotiated amounts  we consider historical experience with the individual farmers  current weather and crop conditions  as well as the fair value of non crop collateral 
for both classes  a long term receivable from farmers in brazil is considered impaired  based on current information and events  if we determine it to be probable that all amounts due under the original terms of the receivable will not be collected 
recognition of interest income on secured advances to farmers is suspended once the farmer defaults on the originally scheduled delivery of agricultural commodities as the collection of future income is determined to not be probable 
no additional interest income is accrued from the point of default until ultimate recovery  where amounts collected are credited first against the receivable and then to any unrecognized interest income 
inventories and derivatives we use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with agricultural commodity prices  transportation costs  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy costs and for positioning our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we are exposed to loss in the event of non performance by counterparties to certain of these contracts 
the risk of non performance is routinely monitored and adjustments recorded  if necessary  to account for potential non performance 
different assumptions  changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of the counterparties to these derivative instruments could result in additional fair value adjustments and increased expense reflected in cost of goods sold  foreign exchange or interest expense 
we did not have significant allowances relating to non performance by counterparties at december   and our readily marketable commodity inventories  forward purchase and sale contracts  and exchange traded futures and options are valued at fair value 
readily marketable inventories are freely traded  have quoted market prices  may be sold without significant additional processing and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs 
we estimate fair values of commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets 
changes in the fair values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of goods sold 
if we used different methods or factors to estimate fair values  amounts reported as inventories and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts in the consolidated balance sheets and cost of goods sold could differ 
additionally  if market conditions change subsequent to year end  amounts reported in future periods as inventories  unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and cost of goods sold could differ 
recoverable taxes we evaluate the collectibility of our recoverable taxes and record valuation allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful 
recoverable taxes primarily represent value added or other similar transactional taxes paid on the acquisition of raw materials and other services which can be recovered in cash or as compensation of outstanding balances against income taxes or certain other taxes we may owe 
management s assumption about the collectibility of recoverable taxes requires significant judgment because it involves an assessment of the ability and willingness of the applicable federal or local government to refund the taxes 
the balance of these allowances fluctuates depending on the sales activity of existing inventories  purchases of new inventories  percentages of export sales  seasonality  changes in applicable tax rates  cash payment by the applicable government agencies and compensation of outstanding balances against income or certain other taxes owed to the applicable governments 
at december  and  the allowance for recoverable taxes was million and million  respectively 
we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and in cases where we determine that recovery is doubtful  recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts 
property  plant and equipment and other finite lived intangible assets long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and other finite lived intangible assets 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of property  plant and equipment assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the projected future cash flows to be generated by such assets 
if it appears that the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against results of operations 
our judgments related to the expected useful lives of property  plant and equipment assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our property  plant and equipment assets  changes in these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges 
bunge recorded no significant impairment charges for the year ended december  in  we recorded pretax non cash impairment charges of million in cost of goods sold  which consisted of million related to the write down of a european oilseed processing and refining facility  million related to the closure of an older  less efficient oilseed processing facility in the united states and a co located corn oil extraction line  million related to the closure of oilseed processing and refining facilities in europe with restructuring of our european footprint  million related to a long term supply contract acquired in connection with a wheat mill acquisition in brazil  million related to the write down of an older and less efficient brazilian distribution center and million related to the write down of an administrative office in brazil 
in  we recorded pretax non cash impairment charges of million in cost of goods sold in our agribusiness segment  relating to the permanent closure of a smaller  older and less efficient oilseed processing and refining facility in brazil 
in addition  we recorded million of pretax non cash impairment charges in selling  general and administrative expenses in our agribusiness segment  relating to the write down of certain real estate assets in south america 
the fair values of the real estate assets were determined by using third party valuations 
investments in affiliates we continually review our equity investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time that the fair value of the investment is less than our carrying value  the financial condition  operating performance and near term prospects of the investment  which include general market conditions specific to the investment or the industry in which it operates  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery in fair value 
we did not have any significant impairment charges relating to our equity investments in or in  we recorded million of pretax non cash impairment charges in selling  general and administrative expenses in our agribusiness segment relating to an equity investment in a us biodiesel producer 
the fair value of this investment was determined utilizing projected cash flows of the biodiesel producer 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in a business acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
we use a two step process to test goodwill at the reporting unit level 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit 
we selected the discounted cash flow methodology as we believe it is comparable to what would be used by market participants 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise 
these analyses require the use of significant judgments  including judgments about appropriate discount rates  growth rates and terminal values and the timing of expected future cash flows 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit 
sensitivity analyses are performed in order to assess the reasonableness of assumptions 
the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the second step of the process is necessary 
the second step measures the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill 
to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  we compare the fair value of the intangible assets with their carrying values 
the fair values of indefinite lived intangible assets are determined using estimated discount rates 
if the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value  the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to its fair value 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
if estimates or related projections of the fair values of reporting units or indefinite lived intangible assets change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we performed our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarters of  and there have been no significant impairment charges relating to goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets for any of the years ended december   and contingencies we are a party to a large number of claims and lawsuits  primarily tax and labor claims in brazil  arising in the normal course of business  and have accrued our estimate of the probable costs to resolve these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel and is based on an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
for more information on tax and labor claims in brazil  see item legal proceedings 
employee benefit plans we sponsor various us and foreign primarily in canada  europe and brazil pension and post retirement benefit plans 
in connection with the plans  we make various assumptions in the determination of projected benefit obligations and expense recognition related to pension and post retirement obligations 
key assumptions include discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets  asset allocations and rates of future compensation increases 
management develops its assumptions based on its experience and by reference to market related data 
all assumptions are reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary 
a one percentage point decrease in the aggregate in the assumed discount rate on the us and foreign defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans would increase annual expense by million and million  respectively  and would increase the projected benefit obligation by million and million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in the aggregate in the assumed discount rate on the us and foreign defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans would decrease annual expense by million and million  respectively  and would increase the projected benefit obligation by million and million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the long term asset return assumptions on our defined benefit pension plan assets would increase or decrease annual pension expense by million and million  respectively 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we are likely to realize 
we consider projections of future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to assess the need for and the size of the valuation allowances 
if we determine that we can realize a deferred tax asset in excess of our net recorded amount  we decrease the valuation allowance  thereby increasing net income 
conversely  if we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset  we increase the valuation allowance  thereby decreasing net income 
prior to recording a valuation allowance  our deferred tax assets were  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
however  we have recorded valuation allowances of million and million at december  and  respectively  as a result of uncertainty regarding the recoverability of certain net operating loss carryforwards 
we apply a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de recognition of tax benefits 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us  brazil  argentina and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether it is more likely than not additional taxes will be due 
we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determined the liabilities are no longer necessary 
at december  and  we had recorded tax liabilities of million and million  respectively  in our consolidated balance sheets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management as a result of our global operating and financing activities  we are exposed to changes in  among other things  agricultural commodity prices  transportation costs  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy costs which may affect our results of operations and financial position 
we actively monitor and manage these various market risks associated with our business activities 
our risk management decisions take place in various locations but exposure limits are centrally set and monitored 
we have a corporate risk management group which analyzes and monitors various risk exposures globally 
additionally  our board of directors finance and risk policy committee overseas  reviews and periodically revises our overall risk management policies and limits 
we use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with commodity prices  transportation costs  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy costs and for positioning our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we enter into derivative instruments primarily with major financial institutions  commodity exchanges in the case of commodity futures and options  or approved exchange clearing shipping companies in the case of ocean freight 
while these derivative instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  for hedged exposures those fluctuations are generally offset by the changes in fair value of the underlying exposures 
the derivative instruments that we use for hedging purposes are intended to reduce the volatility on our results of operations  however  they can occasionally result in earnings volatility  which may be material 
credit and counterparty risk through our normal business activities  we are subject to significant credit and counterparty risks that arise through normal commercial sales and purchases  including forward commitments to buy or sell  and through various other over the counter otc derivative instruments that we utilize to manage risks inherent in our business activities 
we define credit and counterparty risk as a potential financial loss due to the failure of a counterparty to honor its obligations 
the exposure is measured based upon several factors  including unpaid accounts receivable from counterparties and unrealized gains from otc derivative instruments including forward purchase and sale contracts 
credit and counterparty risk also includes sovereign credit risk 
we actively monitor credit and counterparty risk through credit analysis by local credit staffs and review by various local and corporate committees which monitor counterparty performance 
we record provisions for counterparty losses from time to time as a result of our credit and counterparty analysis 
during periods of tight conditions in global credit markets  downturns in regional or global economic conditions  and or significant price volatility  credit and counterparty risks are heightened 
this increased risk is monitored through  among other things  increased communication with key counterparties  management reviews and specific focus on counterparties or groups of counterparties that we may determine as high risk 
in addition  we have limited new credit extensions in certain cases and reduced our use of nonexchange cleared derivative instruments 
commodities risk we operate in many areas of the food industry  from agricultural raw materials to the production and sale of branded food ingredients 
as a result  we purchase and produce various materials  many of which are agricultural commodities  including soybeans  soybean oil  soybean meal  softseeds including sunflower seed  rapeseed and canola and related oil and meal derived from them  wheat and corn 
in addition  we grow and purchase sugarcane to produce sugar  ethanol and electricity 
agricultural commodities are subject to price fluctuations due to a number of unpredictable factors that may create price risk 
as described above  we are also subject to the risk of counterparty non performance under forward purchase or sale contracts 
from time to time  we have experienced instances of counterparty non performance  including as a result of significant declines in counterparty profitability under these contracts due to significant movements in commodity prices between the time in which the contracts were executed and the contractual forward delivery period 
we enter into various derivative contracts with the primary objective of managing our exposure to adverse price movements in the agricultural commodities used for and produced in our business operations 
we have established policies that limit the amount of unhedged fixed price agricultural commodity positions permissible for our operating companies  which are generally a combination of volume and value at risk var limits 
we measure and review our net commodities position on a daily basis 
our daily net agricultural commodity position consists of inventory  forward purchase and sale contracts  over the counter and exchange traded derivative instruments  including those used to hedge portions of our production requirements 
the fair value of that position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each agricultural commodity by valuing all of our commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period where available or utilizing a close proxy 
var is calculated on the net position and monitored at the and confidence intervals 
in addition  scenario analysis and stress testing are performed 
for example  one measure of market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  are as follows year ended december  year ended december  us in millions fair value market risk fair value market risk highest long position highest short position ocean freight risk ocean freight represents a significant portion of our operating costs 
the market price for ocean freight varies depending on the supply and demand for ocean vessels  global economic conditions and other factors 
we enter into time charter agreements for time on ocean freight vessels based on forecasted requirements for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities 
our time charter agreements generally have terms ranging from two months to approximately five years 
we use financial derivatives  known as freight forward agreements  to hedge portions of our ocean freight costs 
the ocean freight derivatives are included in other current assets and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
energy risk we purchase various energy commodities such as bunker fuel  electricity and natural gas that are used to operate our manufacturing facilities and ocean freight vessels 
the energy commodities are subject to price risk 
we use financial derivatives  including exchange traded and otc swaps and options for various purposes  including to manage our exposure to volatility in energy costs 
these energy derivatives are included in other current assets and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
currency risk our global operations require active participation in foreign exchange markets 
our primary foreign currency exposures are the brazilian real  the euro and other european currencies  the argentine peso and the chinese yuan renminbi 
to reduce the risk arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations  we enter into derivative instruments  such as forward contracts and swaps and foreign currency options 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the related currency exposures 
the potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates as of december  was not material 
when determining our exposure  we exclude intercompany loans that are deemed to be permanently invested 
the repayments of permanently invested intercompany loans are not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future and therefore are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
as a result  the foreign exchange gains and losses on these borrowings are excluded from the determination of net income and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
included in other comprehensive income loss are foreign exchange losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to permanently invested intercompany loans 
interest rate risk we have debt in fixed and floating rate instruments 
we are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure related to our debt portfolio 
the aggregate fair value of our short and long term debt  based on market yields at december   was  million with a carrying value of  million 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the interest yields on our debt at december  would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of our debt 
similarly  a decrease of basis points in the interest yields on our debt at december  would cause an increase of approximately million in the fair value of our debt 
a hypothetical change in libor would result in a change of approximately million in our interest expense 
some of our variable rate debt is denominated in currencies other than in us dollars and is indexed to non us dollar based interest rate indices  such as euribor and tjlp 
as such  the hypothetical change in interest rate ignores the impact from any currency movements 
derivative instruments interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps used by us as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded contemporaneously in earnings 
certain of these swap agreements may be designated as fair value hedges 
the carrying amount of the associated hedged debt is also adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value arising from changes in benchmark interest rates 
ineffectiveness is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset 
there were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements at december  we recognized approximately million  million and million as a reduction in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income in the years ended december   and  respectively  relating to interest rate swap agreements outstanding during the respective periods 
in addition  in  and  we recognized gains of approximately million  million and million  respectively  as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income  related to the amortization of deferred gains on termination of interest rate swap agreements 
there were no interest rate derivates designated as cash flow hedges as of december  and we reclassified losses of approximately zero  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively  from accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income  related to settlements of certain derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges  in connection with forecasted issuances of debt financing see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange derivatives we use a combination of foreign exchange forward and option contracts in certain of our operations to mitigate the risk from exchange rate fluctuations in connection with certain commercial and balance sheet exposures 
the foreign exchange forward and option contracts may be designated as cash flow hedges 
we may also use net investment hedges to partially offset the translation adjustments arising from the remeasurement of our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
we assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items

non exchange traded swaps  options and forwards are presented on a gross short and long position basis 
commodity derivatives we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to movements associated with agricultural commodity prices 
we generally use exchange traded futures and options contracts to minimize the effects of changes in the prices of agricultural commodities on our agricultural commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts  but may also from time to time enter into otc commodity transactions  including swaps  which are settled in cash at maturity or termination based on exchange quoted futures prices 
changes in fair values of exchange traded futures contracts representing the unrealized gains and or losses on these instruments are settled daily generally through our wholly owned futures clearing subsidiary 
forward purchase and sale contracts are primarily settled through delivery of agricultural commodities 
while we consider these exchange traded futures and forward purchase and sale contracts to be effective economic hedges  we do not designate or account for the majority of our commodity contracts as hedges 
changes in fair values of these contracts and related readily marketable agricultural commodity inventories are included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income 
the forward contracts require performance of both us and the contract counterparty in future periods 
contracts to purchase agricultural commodities generally relate to current or future crop years for delivery periods quoted by regulated commodity exchanges 
contracts for the sale of agricultural commodities generally do not extend beyond one future crop cycle

ocean freight derivatives we use derivative instruments referred to as freight forward agreements  or ffas  and ffa options to hedge portions of our current and anticipated ocean freight costs 
a portion of the ocean freight derivatives may be designated as fair value hedges of our firm commitments to purchase time on ocean freight vessels 
changes in the fair value of the ocean freight derivatives that are qualified  designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge  along with the gain or loss on the hedged firm commitments to purchase time on ocean freight vessels that is attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in earnings
