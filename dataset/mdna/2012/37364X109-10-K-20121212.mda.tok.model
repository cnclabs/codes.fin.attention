item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the major elements of our consolidated financial statements 
you should read this discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements  including the accompanying notes  and other detailed information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including under the heading risk factors 
the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes various forward looking statements about our markets  the demand for our products and services and our future plans and results 
these statements are based on assumptions that we consider to be reasonable  but that could prove to be incorrect 
for more information regarding our assumptions  you should refer to the section entitled forward looking statements and assumptions contained in this item in this annual report on form k 
background we design and manufacture instruments and equipment used in the acquisition and processing of seismic data as well as in the characterization and monitoring of producing oil and gas reservoirs 
we have been in the seismic instrument and equipment business since and market our products primarily to the oil and gas industry 
we also design  manufacture and distribute thermal imaging equipment and thermal media products targeted at the screen print  point of sale  signage and textile market sectors 
we have been manufacturing thermal imaging products in our thermal solutions segment since for a more detailed discussion of our business segments and products  see the information under the heading business in this annual report on form k 
consolidated results of operations as we have reported in the past  our sales and operating profits have varied significantly from quarter to quarter  and even year to year  and are expected to continue that trend in the future  especially when our quarterly financial results are impacted by the presence or absence of relatively large  but somewhat erratic  shipments of seismic seabed  borehole reservoir characterization systems and or wireless data acquisition systems 
we have recently received two large orders for permanent seabed reservoir characterization systems 
in february  we received an order from shell brasil petr leo ltda for a million system which is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of fiscal year in november we received the million statoil order for two systems to be delivered over a three year period through fiscal year with revenues and costs to be recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
utilizing the percentage of completion revenue recognition method  we currently expect to recognize approximately  and of the statoil order revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a result of these large orders  we expect our future revenues from the sale of seismic reservoir products to increase significantly compared to historical sales levels 

index to financial statements we report and evaluate financial information for two segments seismic and thermal solutions 
summary financial data by business segment follows in thousands year ended september  seismic traditional exploration product revenues wireless exploration product revenues reservoir product revenues industrial product sales total seismic sales operating income thermal solutions net sales operating income loss corporate net sales operating loss consolidated totals net sales operating income overview fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated net sales for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year the higher level of sales resulted from increased customer demand for our seismic products and particularly robust demand for sales and rentals of our land based wireless or nodal data acquisition systems 
the increased demand for our seismic products is being driven by strong oil and gas exploration activities throughout the world 
consolidated gross profits for fiscal year increased by million  or  from fiscal year the increase in gross profits resulted from increased sales and rentals of our seismic products 
consolidated operating expenses for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year the increase in operating expenses resulted from expanded activities associated with our sales growth  and from increased incentive compensation expenses 
the us statutory tax rate applicable to us for fiscal years and was  however  our effective tax rate was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate for both fiscal years resulted from i the impact of the manufacturers producers deduction available in the united states  ii lower tax rates applicable to income earned in foreign tax jurisdictions and iii research and experimentation tax credits 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated net sales for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year the higher level of sales resulted from increased customer demand for our seismic products and particularly robust demand for sales and rentals of our land based wireless or nodal data acquisition systems 
the increased demand for our seismic products is being driven by strong oil and gas exploration activities throughout the world 

index to financial statements consolidated gross profits for fiscal year increased by million  or  from fiscal year the increase in gross profits resulted from i increased sales and rentals of seismic products  ii a more favorable product mix  and iii improved manufacturing productivity due to higher production output 
consolidated operating expenses for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year the increase in operating expenses resulted from i increased pretax earnings giving rise to million of increased incentive compensation expenses  ii increased product development expenditures of million relating to product enhancements and new product introductions  and iii a general increase in expenses associated with increased sales activities 
the us statutory tax rate applicable to us for fiscal years and was  however  our effective tax rate was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate in fiscal year resulted from i the impact of the manufacturers producers deduction available in the united states and ii an increase in research and experimentation tax credits resulting from united states congress renewal and extension of the tax credit program during fiscal year through december the lower effective tax rate in fiscal year resulted from i the impact of the manufacturers producers deduction available in the united states  ii a revaluation of our united states net deferred tax assets from to  iii the revaluation of a tax loss carryback for our canadian subsidiary  and iv a reduction in our contingent tax expenses 
segment results of operations seismic products fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales sales of our seismic products for the fiscal year ended september  increased by million  or  from the prior fiscal year 
the components of this increase include the following traditional product sales and rentals for the fiscal year ended september   revenues from our traditional products decreased million  or  from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
this decline in revenues primarily resulted from reduced shipments of marine products and was partially offset by increased sales of geophones and connectors 
wireless product sales and rentals for the fiscal year ended september   revenues from our wireless products increased by million  or  from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenues resulted from the continued industry acceptance of our wireless systems in lieu of less efficient legacy cable based systems 
reservoir product sales  rentals and services for the fiscal year ended september   revenues from our reservoir products decreased million  or  from the prior fiscal year 
revenues from these products  which in recent years primarily include our seismic borehole tools  have historically been erratic 
due to the recent receipt of large orders for our permanent seabed reservoir monitoring systems  we expect revenues for our reservoir products to increase significantly in future years 
industrial product sales for the fiscal year ended september   sales of our industrial  or non seismic  products increased million  or  from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily driven by increased shipments of offshore cable products 
the rate of new customer orders for our seismic products  especially large orders for our wireless  marine  borehole and subsea reservoir products  generally occur irregularly thereby making it difficult for us to predict our sales and production levels each quarter 
furthermore  product shipping dates are generally determined by our customers and are not at our discretion 
as a result  these factors have caused past sales of our seismic products to be unpredictable  or lumpy  and we expect this trend to continue into the future 

index to financial statements operating income 
operating income for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year the higher level of operating income resulted primarily from increased sales and specifically sales and rentals of our wireless products 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales 
sales of our seismic products for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year the components of this increase include the following traditional product sales and rentals for the fiscal year ended september   revenues from our traditional products increased million  or  from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
this increase in revenues resulted from increased shipments of marine products  and was partially offset by a decrease in sales of geophones products 
wireless product sales and rentals for the fiscal year ended september   revenues from our wireless products increased by million  or  from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenues resulted from the customer acceptance of our wireless systems to replace less efficient legacy cable based systems 
reservoir product sales  rentals and services for the fiscal year ended september   revenues from our reservoir products increased million  or  from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenues resulted from increased sales of our seismic borehole tools 
industrial product sales for the fiscal year ended september   sales of our industrial  or non seismic  products increased million  or  from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily driven by increased shipments of industrial sensor and specialty cable products 
operating income 
operating income for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year the higher operating income resulted primarily from increased product sales and equipment rentals  improved factory productivity  and a more favorable product mix 
these improvements in our operating income were partially offset by i additional charges for inventory obsolescence due to the aging of certain of our inventories  ii increased incentive compensation expenses due to a higher level of pretax income  and iii operating losses at our subsidiary in the russian federation due to competitive pricing pressures in its local market 
thermal solutions products fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales 
sales of our thermal solutions products for fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year we consider this decrease to be somewhat normal due to recurring fluctuations in product sales volume and not associated with any particular long term trend 
operating income 
our operating income from our thermal solutions products for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year the increase in operating income resulted from improved gross profits due to lower material costs and lower levels of inventory obsolescence expense 

index to financial statements fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales 
sales of our thermal solutions products for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year approximately million of this increase resulted from growing sales to our canadian customers 
we consider the remaining increase to be somewhat normal due to recurring fluctuations in product sales volume and not associated with any long term trend 
operating income 
our operating income from our thermal solutions products for fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year the decline in profitability resulted from i lower margins on product sales due to higher material costs for our film products  ii additional charges for inventory obsolescence expense due to the aging of certain inventories  and iii increased incentive compensation expenses relative to the improvement in our consolidated financial results 
incentive compensation program we adopted an incentive compensation program for fiscal year whereby most employees will be eligible to begin earning incentive compensation if the company reaches a five percent pretax return on stockholders equity  determined as of september  to be eligible to participate in this incentive compensation program  employees must participate in our core values program 
based on our experience in prior years  we expect one hundred percent of our eligible employees to participate in the core values program 
the incentive compensation program does not apply to the employees of our subsidiary in the russian federation since such employees participate in a locally administered bonus program 
certain non executive employees are required to achieve specific goals to earn a significant portion of their total incentive compensation award 
any bonus awards earned under this program in fiscal year will be paid out to eligible employees after the end of the fiscal year 
upon reaching the five percent threshold under this proposed program  an incentive compensation accrual will be established equal to percent of the amount of any consolidated pretax profits above the five percent pretax return threshold 
the maximum aggregate bonus available under the program for fiscal year was originally million  however  our board of directors subsequently increased the maximum bonus pool to million based on the record earnings of the company in fiscal year under this program as modified  for the fiscal years ended september  and  we had accrued million and million  respectively  of incentive compensation expense 
liquidity and capital resources at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  we had million of short term investments at september  for fiscal year  we generated approximately million of cash from operating activities 
the primary sources of cash generated in our operating activities resulted from net income of million 
additional sources of cash included net non cash charges of million for deferred income tax expense  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  inventory obsolescence and bad debts 
other sources of cash from operating activities included i a million increase in accounts payable due to increased purchases of raw materials  ii a million increase in deferred revenue resulting from an increase in the amount of advanced payments received from our customers  iii a million decrease in trade accounts and notes receivable primarily resulting from improved cash receipts from customers during fiscal year  and iv a million increase in accrued expenses and other  including a million increase in incentive compensation expenses due to increased consolidated pretax earnings 
these sources of cash were offset by i a million increase in inventories due to increasing levels of work in process resulting from known and anticipated product orders  rental equipment demands and the 
index to financial statements production of a permanent seabed acquisition for shell brasil petr leo ltda  ii a million adjustment to transfer gross profits from rental equipment sales to investing activities since such transactions involve the sale of long lived assets  and iii a million increase in prepaid income taxes related to intercompany sales 
for fiscal year  we used approximately million of cash in investing activities 
the uses of cash primarily resulted from i our investment of million for rental equipment  ii million of capital expenditures for property and equipment  and iii a million net increase in our short term investments 
in addition  we transferred million of inventories to our rental equipment during fiscal year which had a non cash impact 
the uses of cash outlined above were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of used rental equipment 
due to strong customer demand for our wireless rental equipment in north america and the recent establishment of a branch office in bogota  colombia  we estimate that our capital expenditures for rental equipment in fiscal year could be approximately million or more  including non cash transfers from our inventory account 
in addition  we estimate that other capital expenditures for property and equipment could be approximately million  in part resulting from the need to expand our production capacity due to the recently received statoil order 
similar to fiscal year  in fiscal year we expect to sell a significant amount of our rental equipment to customers and  therefore  we expect to generate sales proceeds to partially or fully offset our investment in rental equipment 
beyond this we expect to finance our capital expenditures in rental equipment and other property and equipment from our cash on hand  internal cash flow and or from borrowings under our credit agreement 
for fiscal year  we generated approximately million of cash in the financing activities from the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits 
at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
for fiscal year  we generated approximately million of cash in operating activities 
sources of cash generated in our operating activities resulted from net income of million 
additional sources of cash included net non cash charges of million for deferred income tax benefit  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  inventory obsolescence and bad debts 
other sources of cash included i a million decrease in trade accounts and notes receivable primarily resulting from improved cash receipts from customers during fiscal year  ii a million increase in accrued expenses and other primarily resulting from an increase of million for incentive compensation expenses due to increased consolidated pretax earnings  and a million increase in warranty accruals due to increased potential warranty exposure resulting from increased product sales  and iii a million increase in accounts payable due to increased purchases of raw materials 
these sources of cash were offset by i a million increase in inventories due to the replenishment of low levels of our wireless data acquisition system inventories  and increasing levels of work in process resulting from product orders and anticipated demand for wireless data acquisition system sales and rentals  ii a million adjustment to transfer gross profits from rental equipment sales to investing activities since such transactions involve the sale of long lived assets  iii a million increase in other current assets resulting from the advanced payment of income taxes in certain tax jurisdictions  iv a million decrease in income tax payable resulting from the payment of income taxes owed on our pretax profits and v a million decrease in deferred revenue resulting from a reduction in the amount of advanced payments received from our customers 
for fiscal year  we used approximately million of cash in investing activities

in addition  we transferred million of inventories to our rental equipment during fiscal year which had a non cash impact 
the uses of cash outlined above were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of used rental equipment 
for fiscal year  we generated approximately million of cash in the financing activities of our operations 
during fiscal year  we generated million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits 
partially offsetting these proceeds was a million cash payment to pay off a mortgage loan obligation 

index to financial statements at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
for fiscal year  we generated approximately million of cash from our operating activities 
sources of cash generated in our operating activities include net income of million 
additional sources of cash include net non cash charges of million for deferred income tax expense  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  inventory obsolescence and bad debts 
other sources of cash included i a million decrease in inventories due to improved management activities  ii a million increase in accrued expenses primarily resulting from higher incentive compensation costs resulting from higher levels of pretax income and iii a million increase in income taxes payable primarily resulting from the increase in taxable income 
these sources of cash were offset by i a million increase in accounts and notes receivable resulting from higher levels of sales  ii a million decrease in accounts payable due to increases in purchases of raw materials and iii a million decrease in prepaid expenses and other resulting from the timing of funding our payrolls 
for fiscal year  we used approximately million of cash in investing activities primarily resulting from our capital expenditures for rental equipment 
in addition  we transferred million of inventories to our rental equipment during fiscal year which had a non cash impact 
for fiscal year  we generated approximately million of cash in the financing activities of our operations 
sources of cash included million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits 
these sources of cash were offset by million of principal payments under mortgage loans and a million payment as a penalty for early extinguishment of debt 
on march   we entered into a new credit agreement as amended  the credit agreement with a bank 
under the credit agreement  we can borrow up to million principally secured by our accounts receivable  inventories and equipment 
in addition  certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the credit agreement and such subsidiaries have secured the obligations by the pledge of certain of the assets of such subsidiaries 
the credit agreement expires on march  the credit agreement limits the incurrence of additional indebtedness  requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios  restricts us and our subsidiaries ability to pay cash dividends and contains other covenants customary in agreements of this type 
the interest rate for borrowings under the credit agreement is a libor based rate with a margin spread of basis points depending upon the maintenance of certain ratios 
at september   the interest rate was 
at september  and  there were no borrowings under the credit agreement  standby letters of credit outstanding in the amount of million and additional borrowings available of million 
please see risk factors for more information about the restrictive covenants imposed on us by the credit agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any obligations which meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement and which have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial statements or the items contained therein that are material to investors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we consider many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls  and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debt reserves  inventory obsolescence reserves  self insurance reserves for medical expenses  product warranty reserves  intangible assets  stock based compensation and deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors  including the impact from the current economic conditions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions 

index to financial statements our normal credit terms for trade receivables are days 
in certain situations  credit terms for trade receivables may be extended to days or longer and such receivables generally do not require collateral 
additionally  we provide long term financing in the form of promissory notes when competitive conditions require such financing and  in such cases  we may require collateral 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers accounts and notes receivable and allowances are recognized for potential credit losses 
our long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment review  if necessary  includes a comparison of expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by an asset group with the associated carrying value of the related assets 
if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value 
management makes judgments regarding the interpretation of tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and causes changes to previous estimates of tax liability 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions as well as by the internal revenue service 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all open tax years 
the potential outcomes of examinations are regularly assessed in determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes and income tax liabilities 
management believes that adequate provisions have been made for reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
we record a write down of our inventories when the cost basis of any manufactured product  including any estimated future costs to complete the manufacturing process  exceeds its net realizable value 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined on a first in  first out method  except that our subsidiary in the russian federation uses an average cost method to value its inventories 
we periodically review the composition of our inventories to determine if market demand  product modifications  technology changes  excessive quantities on hand and other factors hinder our ability to recover its investment in such inventories 
management s assessment is based upon historical product demand  estimated future product demand and various other judgments and estimates 
inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded when such assessments reveal that portions or components of our inventory investment will not be realized in our operating activities 
we primarily derive revenue from the sale and short term rental under operating leases  of products 
our products are produced in a standard manufacturing operation 
we recognize revenue from product sales when i title passes to the customer  ii the customer assumes risks and rewards of ownership  iii the product sales price has been determined  iv collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured  and v product delivery occurs as directed by our customer 
our products are generally sold without any customer acceptance provisions and our standard terms of sale do not allow customers to return products for credit 
we recognize rental revenues as earned over the rental period 
rentals of our equipment generally range from daily rentals to rental periods of up to six months or longer 
service revenues are recognized when services are rendered and are generally priced on a per day rate 
except for certain of our reservoir characterization products  our products are generally sold without any customer acceptance provisions and our standard terms of sale do not allow customers to return products for credit 
we expect to utilize the percentage of completion method the poc method to recognize revenues and costs on future contracts having the following characteristics the contract requires significant custom designs for customer specific applications  the product design requires significant engineering efforts  the contract requires the customer to make progress payments during the contract term  and  the contract requires at least days of engineering and manufacturing effort 

index to financial statements the poc method will require our senior management to make estimates  at least quarterly  of the i total costs of the contract  ii manufacturing progress against the contract and iii the estimated cost to complete the contract 
these estimates will impact the amount of revenue and gross profit we will recognize for each reporting period 
significant estimates that may affect future cost to complete a contract include the cost and availability of raw materials and component parts  engineering services  manufacturing equipment  labor  manufacturing capacity  factory productivity  contract penalties and disputes  product warranties and other contingent factors 
the cumulative impact of periodic revisions to the future cost to complete a contract will be reflected in the period in which these changes become known  including  to the extent required  the recognition of losses at the time such losses are known and estimable on contracts in progress 
due to the various estimates inherent in the poc method  actual results could differ from those estimates 
most of our products do not require installation assistance or sophisticated instruction 
we offer a standard product warranty  which obligates us to repair or replace equipment with manufacturing defects 
we maintain a reserve for future warranty costs based on historical experience or  in the absence of historical experience  management estimates 
we record bill and hold arrangements consistent with guidance around bill and hold arrangements 
as of september  and  we had no sales under bill and hold arrangements 
forward looking statements and assumptions this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference herein  if any  contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
you can identify these forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  intend  expect  plan  budget  forecast  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  potential  continue or similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial position or state other forward looking information 
these forward looking statements reflect our best judgment about future events and trends based on the information currently available to us 
however  there may be events in the future that we are not able to predict or control 
the factors listed under the caption risk factors  as well as cautionary language in this annual report on form k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position  and actual events and results of operations may vary materially from our current expectations 
management s current outlook and assumptions our estimates as to future results and industry trends  to the extent described in this document  are generally based on assumptions regarding the future level of seismic exploration activity  seismic reservoir monitoring projects  demand for offshore cable and other industrial products and demand for thermal imaging technologies  and in turn  their effect on the demand and pricing of our products and services 
our analysis of the market and its impact on us is based upon the following assumptions although crude oil prices have stabilized over the last two years  we believe the impact of the sovereign debt issues in europe  slower economic growth in the us and china and the resulting recessionary fears  combined with potentially volatile and unsteady energy commodity prices may constrain oil and gas exploration activities in north america and also in certain international markets 
furthermore  we believe many of our seismic customers relying on credit markets as the source of funds for their capital spending could be prohibited from purchasing new equipment until financial markets stabilize and demand for exploration activities increases 
the uncertainty of these global 
index to financial statements economic matters and their ultimate impact on energy commodity prices  exploration activities and on our customers ability to access credit markets may cause demand for our seismic exploration products to decrease 
we believe the impact of political conditions and hostilities around the world  including those in north africa and the middle east  which may impact oil and gas commodity prices  will not cause a significant increase or decrease in demand for our seismic products for the foreseeable future 
some of our traditional seismic products are characterized as low margin commodity products with intense international competition 
sales levels for these products have been relatively flat since fiscal year and we do not expect sales levels for these lower margin products to grow during fiscal year as we focus our product development and production activities of higher margin specialty products and new technologies  especially our wireless and reservoir products  we expect sales of these lower margin traditional seismic products to decline in the future 
in regards to our land and marine wireless product sales and rentals during fiscal year  we expect sales and rental of our wireless products to increase over fiscal year levels 
we believe this growth will come from new international customers and from existing customers 
seismic equipment rentals were approximately of our fiscal year consolidated revenues 
these equipment rentals primarily include wireless product rentals and  to a lesser extent  rentals of our traditional and reservoir products 
we expect strong customer demand for rental equipment in fiscal year and  therefore  we plan to significantly expand our rental equipment fleet in both north and south america 
as a result  we expect rental revenues from our seismic products to increase over fiscal year levels 
based upon recent orders received from shell brasil petr leo ltda and statoil for our permanent seabed reservoir monitoring systems  we expect revenues for our reservoir products and services to increase significantly when compared to historical revenue levels for these products 
we expect sales of our non seismic products  including our industrial products  offshore cables and thermal printing equipment and film to increase over fiscal year levels 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have some market risk relative to sensitive instruments entered into for trading purposes and have only very limited risk as to arrangements entered into other than for trading purposes 
we do not engage in commodity or commodity derivative instrument purchase or sales transactions 
because of the inherent unpredictability of foreign currency rates and interest rates  as well as other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in this item 
short term investment risk our short term investments consisting of corporate bonds  government bonds and other similar investments are classified for accounting purposes as available for sale 
if these short term investments are not held to maturity  the proceeds obtained when the instruments are sold will be impacted by the current interest rates at the time they are sold 
foreign currency and operations risk one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  geospace technologies eurasia  is located in the russian federation 
therefore  our financial results may be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  weak economic conditions in the russian federation or changes in its political climate 
our consolidated balance sheet at september  reflected approximately million of net working capital related to geospace technologies eurasia 
for third party transactions  geospace technologies eurasia both 
index to financial statements receives its income and pays its expenses primarily in rubles 
to the extent that transactions of geospace technologies eurasia are settled in rubles  a devaluation of the ruble versus the us dollar could reduce any contribution from geospace technologies eurasia to our consolidated results of operations and total comprehensive income as reported in us dollars 
we do not hedge the market risk with respect to our operations in the russian federation  therefore  such risk is a general and unpredictable risk of future disruptions in the valuation of rubles versus us dollars to the extent such disruptions result in any reduced valuation of geospace technologies eurasia s net working capital or future contributions to our consolidated results of operations 
at september   the foreign exchange rate of the us dollar to the ruble was us if the us dollar versus ruble exchange rate were to decline by ten percent  our working capital could decline by million 
foreign currency intercompany accounts and notes receivable from time to time  we provide access to capital to our foreign subsidiaries through us dollar denominated interest bearing promissory notes 
such funds are generally used by our foreign subsidiaries to purchase capital assets and for general working capital needs 
in addition  we sell products to our foreign subsidiaries in us dollars on trade credit terms 
because us dollar denominated intercompany debts are accounted for in the local currency of our foreign subsidiaries  any appreciation or devaluation of such foreign currencies against the us dollar will result in a gain or loss  respectively  to our consolidated statement of operations 
at september   we had outstanding intercompany accounts receivable of million from our canadian subsidiary 
we have entered into an agreement with a canadian bank to hedge million of this foreign exchange exposure  resulting in a net us dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable exposure to the canadian dollar of million 
at september   the foreign exchange rate of the us dollar to the canadian dollar was if the dollar exchange rate were to strengthen by ten percent against the canadian dollar  we would recognize a foreign exchange loss of million at our canadian subsidiary 
at september   we had outstanding accounts receivable of million from our subsidiary in the russian federation  and the us dollar to ruble exchange rate was us if the us dollar exchange rate were to strengthen by ten percent against the russian ruble  we would recognize a foreign exchange loss of million at our russian subsidiary 
floating interest rate risk the new credit agreement contains a floating interest rate  which subjects us to the risk of increased interest costs associated with any upward movements in bank market interest rates 
under the new credit agreement our borrowing interest rate is a libor based rate plus basis points 
as of september   we had no borrowings under the new credit agreement
