the new york times company item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risk factors described below  as well as the other information included in this annual report on form k 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any or all of these risks  or by other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial  that may adversely affect us in the future 
economic weakness and uncertainty in the united states  in the regions in which we operate and in key advertising categories have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our advertising revenues 
advertising spending  which drives a significant portion of our revenues  is sensitive to economic conditions 
national and local economic conditions  particularly in the new york city and boston metropolitan regions  affect the levels of our national  retail and classified advertising revenues 
economic factors that have adversely affected advertising revenues include lower consumer and business spending  high unemployment  depressed home sales and other challenges affecting the economy 
our advertising revenues are particularly adversely affected if advertisers respond to weak and uneven economic conditions by reducing their budgets or shifting spending patterns or priorities  or if they are forced to consolidate or cease operations 
continuing weak and uncertain economic conditions and outlook would adversely affect our level of advertising revenues and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our businesses face substantial competition for advertisers 
we face substantial competition for advertising revenues in our various markets from free and paid newspapers  magazines  web sites  digital platforms and applications  television  radio  other forms of media  direct marketing and digital advertising networks and exchanges 
competition for advertising is generally based on audience levels and demographics  price  service and advertising results 
it has intensified as a result of both the continued development and fragmentation of digital media and adverse economic conditions 
competition from all of these media and services affects our ability to attract and retain advertisers and consumers and to maintain or increase our advertising rates 
the increasing popularity of digital media and the shift in consumer habits and advertising expenditures from traditional to digital media has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our print advertising revenues 
web sites  applications for mobile devices  social networking tools and other digital platforms distributing news and other content continue to gain popularity 
this migration to digital technologies among both providers and consumers of content is likely to continue with companies seeking greater efficiencies and consumers seeking more value  convenience and timeliness of digital technologies 
as a result  print subscriptions may decline and advertising spending may continue to shift from traditional media forms to digital media 
we expect that advertisers will continue to allocate increasing portions of their budgets to digital media  which through pay for performance and keyword targeted advertising can offer more measurable returns than traditional print media 
this secular shift has intensified competition for advertising in traditional media and has contributed to and is likely to continue to contribute to a decline in print advertising revenue 
we may not achieve sufficient subscribers or audience levels to make our digital pay models financially attractive 
during  we launched digital subscriptions at the times  the iht and the globe  with the intention of developing a new consumer revenue stream while preserving our digital advertising business 
our ability to build a subscriber base on our digital platforms depends on market acceptance  consumer habits  pricing  an adequate online infrastructure  terms of delivery platforms and other factors 
traffic levels may stagnate or decline as a result of the implementation of a pay model  which may adversely affect our advertiser base and advertising rates and result in a decline in digital revenues 
if we are unable to convert and retain a sufficient number of digital users to a paid status or maintain our digital audience for advertising sales  our business  financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected 
if we are unable to retain and grow our digital audience  our digital businesses will be adversely affected 
the increasing number of digital media options available on the internet  through social networking tools and through mobile and other devices distributing news and other content  is expanding consumer choice significantly 
faced with a multitude of media choices and a dramatic increase in accessible information  consumers may place greater value on when  where  how and at what price they consume digital content than they do on the source or the new york times company p 
reliability of such content 
news aggregation web sites and customized news feeds often free to users may reduce our traffic levels by creating a disincentive for the audience to visit our web sites or use our digital applications 
in addition  the undifferentiated presentation of some of our content in aggregation with other content may lead audiences to fail to distinguish our content from the content of other providers 
our reputation for quality journalism and content is important in competing for revenues in this environment and is based on consumer and advertiser perceptions 
if consumers fail to differentiate our content from other content providers in digital media  or if the quality of our journalism or content is perceived as less reliable  we may not be able to increase our online traffic sufficiently or retain a base of frequent visitors to our digital platforms 
online traffic is also driven by internet search results  including search results provided by google  the primary search engine directing traffic to the web sites of the about group and many of our other sites 
search engines frequently update and change the methods for directing search queries to web pages or change methodologies and metrics for valuing the quality and performance of internet traffic on delivering cost per click advertisements 
any such changes could decrease the amount of revenue that we generate from online advertisements 
the failure to successfully manage search engine optimization efforts across our businesses could result in a significant decrease in traffic to our various web sites  which could result in substantial decreases in conversion rates and repeat business  as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic  any or all of which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if traffic levels stagnate or decline  we may not be able to create sufficient advertiser interest in our digital businesses or to maintain or increase the advertising rates of the inventory on our digital platforms 
even if we maintain traffic levels  the market position of our brands may not be enough to counteract a significant downward pressure on advertising rates as a result of a significant increase in inventory 
the about group depends upon arrangements with google  and any changes in this relationship or google s practices could adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
cost per click revenue of the about group is principally derived from an arrangement with google 
if the about group is unable to continue the existing agreement with google on favorable terms and conditions or if google s position in the marketplace wanes  the about group s business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
in addition  the amount of revenue we receive from google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control  including the efficiency of google s system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings on our content pages and judgments made by google about the relative attractiveness to the advertiser of clicks on paid listings on our web pages 
changes to google s paid listings network efficiency or its judgment about the relative attractiveness of clicks on paid listings on our web pages has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the about group s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to remain competitive  we must be able to respond to and capitalize on changes in technology  services and standards and changes in consumer behavior  and significant capital investments may be required 
technological developments in the media industry continue to evolve rapidly 
advances in technology have led to an increasing number of methods for the delivery of news and other content and have driven consumer demand and expectations in unanticipated directions 
if we are unable to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods that provide optimal user experiences  our business  financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected 
technological developments also pose other challenges that could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position 
new delivery platforms may lead to pricing restrictions  the loss of distribution control and the loss of a direct relationship with consumers 
we may also be adversely affected if the use of technology developed to block the display of advertising on web sites proliferates 
technological developments and any changes we make to our business model may require significant capital investments 
we may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products  services or opportunities and we may incur costs of research and development in building and maintaining the necessary and continually evolving technology infrastructure 
it may also be difficult to attract and retain talent for critical positions 
some of our existing competitors and new entrants may have greater operational  financial and other resources or may otherwise be better positioned to compete for opportunities and as a result  our digital businesses may be less successful 
p 
the new york times company decreases in print circulation volume adversely affect our circulation and advertising revenues 
advertising and circulation revenues are affected by circulation and readership levels of our newspaper properties 
competition for circulation and readership is generally based upon format  content  quality  service  timeliness and price 
in recent years  our newspaper properties  and the newspaper industry as a whole  have experienced declining print circulation volume 
this is due to  among other factors  increased competition from digital media formats and sources other than traditional newspapers often free to users  declining discretionary spending by consumers affected by weak economic conditions  high subscription and single copy rates  and a growing preference among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news other than from a newspaper 
we have also experienced volume declines as a result of our strategy to implement circulation price increases at many of our newspaper properties and to focus on individually paid circulation that is preferred by advertisers 
if these or other factors result in a continued decline in circulation volume  the rate and volume of advertising revenues may be adversely affected as rates reflect circulation and readership  among other factors 
these factors could also affect our ability to institute circulation price increases for our products at a rate sufficient to offset circulation volume declines 
we may also incur increased spending on marketing designed to attract and retain subscribers or drive traffic to our digital products  and we may not be able to recover these costs through circulation and advertising revenues 
if we are unable to execute cost control measures successfully  our total operating costs may be greater than expected  which may adversely affect our profitability 
we have significantly reduced operating costs by reducing staff and employee benefits and implementing general cost control measures across the company  and expect to continue these cost management efforts 
if we do not achieve expected savings or our operating costs increase as a result of our strategic initiatives  our total operating costs may be greater than anticipated 
in addition  if our cost control strategy is not managed properly  such efforts may affect the quality of our products and our ability to generate future revenue 
reductions in staff and employee compensation and benefits could also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees 
significant portions of our expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with revenues 
if we are not able to implement further cost control efforts or reduce our fixed costs sufficiently in response to a decline in our revenues  we may experience a higher percentage decline in our income from continuing operations 
a significant increase in the price of newsprint  or limited availability of newsprint supply  would have an adverse effect on our operating results 
the cost of raw materials  of which newsprint is the major component  represented approximately of our total operating costs in the price of newsprint has historically been volatile and may increase as a result of various factors  including a reduction in the number of suppliers as a result of restructurings and consolidations in the north american newsprint industry  declining newsprint supply as a result of paper mill closures and conversions to other grades of paper  and other factors that adversely impact supplier profitability  including increases in operating expenses caused by raw material and energy costs  and a rise in the value of the canadian dollar  which adversely affects canadian suppliers whose costs are incurred in canadian dollars but whose newsprint sales are priced in us dollars 
in addition  we rely on our suppliers for deliveries of newsprint 
the availability of our newsprint supply may be affected by various factors  including strikes and other disruptions that may affect deliveries of newsprint 
if newsprint prices increase significantly or we experience significant disruptions in the availability of our newsprint supply in the future  our operating results will be adversely affected 
the underfunded status of our pension plans may adversely affect our operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we sponsor several qualified defined benefit pension plans 
we are required to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by laws governing these employee benefit plans 
the difference between the obligations and assets of the qualified defined benefit plans  or the funded status of the qualified defined benefit plans  is a significant factor in determining pension expense and the ongoing funding requirements to those plans 
our qualified defined benefit pension plans were underfunded as the new york times company p 
of the january   valuation date and we expect to make substantial contributions in the future to fund this deficiency 
in addition  while we sold the regional media group in january  we retained pension assets and liabilities and postretirement obligations related to employees of that business 
future volatility and disruption in the stock and bond markets could cause declines in the asset values of our qualified defined benefit pension plans 
in addition  a decrease in the discount rate used to determine the liabilities for pension obligations will result in increased liabilities 
if investment returns on plan assets are below expectations or interest rates decrease or remain very low  our contributions may be higher than currently anticipated 
as a result  we may have less cash available for working capital and other corporate uses  which may have an adverse impact on our operations  financial condition and liquidity 
due to our participation in multiemployer pension plans  we have exposures under those plans that may extend beyond what our obligations would be with respect to our employees 
we participate in  and make periodic contributions to  various multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our union employees 
our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans  inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability  low interest rates  lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies 
we have incurred significant withdrawal liabilities to the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate  such as the liability assessed against us in in connection with amendments to various collective bargaining agreements affecting certain multiemployer pension plans 
we may be required to make additional contributions under applicable law with respect to those plans or other multiemployer pension plans from which we may withdraw or partially withdraw 
our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer pension plan will depend on the extent of that plan s funding of vested benefits 
if a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate has significant underfunded liabilities  such underfunding will increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability 
a significant number of our employees are unionized  and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if labor negotiations or contracts were to further restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations 
approximately half of our full time equivalent work force are unionized 
as a result  we are required to negotiate the wages  salaries  benefits  staffing levels and other terms with many of our employees collectively 
our results could be adversely affected if future labor negotiations or contracts were to further restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations 
if we were to experience labor unrest  strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or otherwise  or if we are unable to negotiate labor contracts on reasonable terms  our ability to produce and deliver our most significant products could be impaired 
in addition  our ability to make short term adjustments to control compensation and benefits costs  rebalance our portfolio of businesses or otherwise adapt to changing business needs may be limited by the terms and duration of our collective bargaining agreements 
we may buy or sell different properties as a result of our evaluation of our portfolio of businesses 
such acquisitions or divestitures would affect our costs  revenues  profitability and financial position 
from time to time  we evaluate the various components of our portfolio of businesses and may  as a result  buy or sell different properties 
these acquisitions or divestitures affect our costs  revenues  profitability and financial position 
we may also consider the acquisition of specific properties or businesses that fall outside our traditional lines of business if we deem such properties sufficiently attractive 
divestitures have inherent risks  including possible delays in closing transactions including potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals  the risk of lower than expected sales proceeds for the divested businesses  unexpected costs associated with the separation of the business to be sold from our integrated information technology systems and other operating systems  and potential post closing claims for indemnification 
in addition  adverse economic or market conditions may result in fewer potential bidders and unsuccessful sales efforts 
expected cost savings  which are offset by revenue losses from divested businesses  may also be difficult to achieve or maximize due to our fixed cost structure  and we may experience varying success in reducing fixed costs or transferring liabilities previously associated with the divested businesses 
acquisitions also involve risks  including difficulties in integrating acquired operations  diversions of management resources  debt incurred in financing these acquisitions including the related possible reduction in our credit ratings and increase in our cost of borrowing  differing levels of management and internal control effectiveness p 
the new york times company at the acquired entities and other unanticipated problems and liabilities 
competition for certain types of acquisitions  particularly digital properties  is significant 
even if successfully negotiated  closed and integrated  certain acquisitions or investments may prove not to advance our business strategy and may fall short of expected return on investment targets 
from time to time  we make noncontrolling minority investments in private entities and these investments may be subject to capital calls 
we may have limited voting rights or an inability to influence the direction of such entities  although income from such investments may represent a significant portion of our income 
therefore  the success of these ventures may be dependent upon the efforts of our partners  fellow investors and licensees 
these investments are generally illiquid  and the absence of a market inhibits our ability to dispose of them 
this inhibition as well as an inability to control the timing or process relating to a disposition could adversely affect our liquidity and the value we may ultimately attain on a disposition 
if the value of the companies in which we invest declines  we may be required to record a charge to earnings 
our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 
our debt agreements contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions 
for example  these covenants  among other things  restrict  subject to certain exceptions  our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred equity  pay dividends on or make distributions to holders of our common stock or make other restricted payments  create or incur liens on certain assets to secure debt  make certain investments  acquisitions or dispositions  consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  prepay debt  or enter into certain transactions with affiliates 
in addition  our credit facility has a springing financial covenant that requires us to satisfy a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio when availability under the credit facility falls below the greater of million or of the commitment for three consecutive business days 
these restrictions limit our flexibility in operating our business and responding to opportunities 
changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity  increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options 
our long term debt is currently rated below investment grade by standard poor s and moody s investors service 
if our credit ratings remain below investment grade or are lowered further  borrowing costs for future long term debt or short term borrowing facilities may increase and our financing options  including our access to the unsecured borrowing market  would be more limited 
we may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility 
in addition  macroeconomic conditions  such as continued or increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets  would adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capital intensive internal initiatives 
we may be required to record non cash impairment charges with respect to certain of our assets 
each year  we evaluate the various components of our portfolio in connection with annual impairment testing 
we also continually evaluate whether current factors or indicators require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets  as well as other investments and other long lived assets 
we may be required to record a non cash charge if the financial statement carrying value of an asset is in excess of its estimated fair value 
fair value could be adversely affected by weak economic or market conditions within our industry that may have an adverse impact on our projected future cash flows or our stock price 
an impairment charge would adversely affect our reported earnings 
we may not be able to protect intellectual property rights upon which our business relies  and if we lose intellectual property protection  our assets may lose value 
our business depends on our intellectual property  including our valuable brands  content  services and the new york times company p 
internally developed technology 
we believe our proprietary trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our continued success and our competitive position 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our content  services  technology and other intellectual property  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will prevent any misappropriation or confusion among consumers and merchants  or unauthorized use of these rights 
advancements in technology have exacerbated the risk by making it easier to duplicate and disseminate content 
in addition  as our business and the risk of misappropriation of our intellectual property rights have become more global in scope  we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights in a cost effective manner in a multitude of jurisdictions with varying laws 
if we are unable to procure  protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  we may not realize the full value of these assets  and our business may suffer 
if we must litigate in the united states or elsewhere to enforce our intellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  such litigation may be costly and divert the attention of our management 
our class b common stock is principally held by descendants of adolph s 
ochs  through a family trust  and this control could create conflicts of interest or inhibit potential changes of control 
we have two classes of stock class a common stock and class b common stock 
holders of class a common stock are entitled to elect of the board of directors and to vote  with holders of class b common stock  on the reservation of shares for equity grants  certain material acquisitions and the ratification of the selection of our auditors 
holders of class b common stock are entitled to elect the remainder of the board and to vote on all other matters 
our class b common stock is principally held by descendants of adolph s 
ochs  who purchased the times in a family trust holds approximately of the class b common stock 
as a result  the trust has the ability to elect of the board of directors and to direct the outcome of any matter that does not require a vote of the class a common stock 
under the terms of the trust agreement  the trustees are directed to retain the class b common stock held in trust and to vote such stock against any merger  sale of assets or other transaction pursuant to which control of the times passes from the trustees  unless they determine that the primary objective of the trust can be achieved better by the implementation of such transaction 
because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger  takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses  the market price of our class a common stock could be adversely affected 
legislative and regulatory developments may result in increased costs and lower advertising revenues from our digital businesses 
all of our operations are subject to government regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate 
due to the wide geographic scope of its operations  the iht is subject to regulation by political entities throughout the world 
in addition  our web sites are available worldwide and are subject to laws regulating the internet both within and outside the united states 
we may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply 
advertising revenues from our digital businesses could be adversely affected  directly or indirectly  by existing or future laws and regulations relating to the use of consumer data in digital media

in december  the company was moved from the s p stock index to the s p midcap stock index  and we believe the latter index now provides a more meaningful comparison 
the peer group returns are weighted by market capitalization at the beginning of each year 
the peer group is comprised of the company and the following media companies gannett co  inc  media general  inc  the mcclatchy company and the washington post company 
stockholder return is measured by dividing a the sum of i the cumulative amount of dividends declared for the measurement period  assuming monthly reinvestment of dividends  and ii the difference between the issuer s share price at the end and the beginning of the measurement period by b the share price at the beginning of the measurement period 
as a result  stockholder return includes both dividends and stock appreciation

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial condition as of december   and results of operations for the three years ended december  this item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report 
executive overview we are a leading global  multimedia news and information company that currently includes newspapers  digital businesses  investments in paper mills and other investments 
we classify our businesses based on our operating strategies into two reportable segments  the news media group and the about group 
the news media group consists of the following divisions the new york times media group  which includes the times  the iht  nytimes 
com and related businesses  the new england media group  which includes the globe  bostonglobe 
com  boston 
com  the t g  telegram 
com and related businesses  and the regional media group  which included regional newspapers  other print publications and related businesses in alabama  california  florida  louisiana  north carolina and south carolina 
on january   we completed the sale of the regional media group to halifax media holdings llc for million in cash  subject to certain adjustments 
the about group consists of about

news media group the news media group generates revenues principally from advertising and circulation 
other revenues primarily consist of revenues from news services syndication  commercial printing  rental income  digital archives and direct mail advertising services 
the news media group s main operating costs are employee related costs and raw materials  primarily newsprint 
news media group revenues in by category and percentage share are below

p 
the new york times company about group the about group generates revenues through cost per click advertising sponsored links for which the about group is paid when a user clicks on the ad  display advertising and e commerce including sales lead generation 
almost all of its revenues in are derived from the sale of cost per click and display advertising 
cost per click advertising accounted for of the about group s total advertising revenues in the about group s main operating costs are employee related costs and content and hosting costs 
joint ventures our investments accounted for under the equity method are as follows a interest in metro boston  which publishes a free daily newspaper in the greater boston area  a interest in a canadian newsprint company  malbaie  a interest in a partnership  madison  operating a supercalendered paper mill in maine  a interest in quadrantone  an online advertising network that sells bundled premium  targeted display advertising onto local newspaper and other web sites  and a interest in fenway sports group  which owns the boston red sox baseball club  liverpool football club a soccer team in the english premier league  approximately of new england sports network a regional cable sports network  and of roush fenway racing a leading nascar team 
we sold of our units in fenway sports group in july and units in february we continue to explore the sale of our remaining units in fenway sports group  in whole or in parts 
business environment we believe that a number of factors and industry trends have had  and will continue to have  an adverse effect on our business and prospects 
these include the following economic conditions the business environment in remained challenging due in large part to the slow economic recovery in the united states and uncertain global conditions 
advertising spending  which drives a significant portion of our revenues  is susceptible to economic conditions 
the level of advertising sales in any period may be affected by advertisers decisions to increase or decrease their advertising expenditures in response to anticipated consumer demand and general economic conditions 
in  advertisers continued to exercise caution in response to uneven economic conditions and lingering uncertainty about the economic outlook 
the challenging advertising marketplace contributed to declines in print advertising revenues and moderating growth trends in digital advertising revenues at the news media group in compared with weak national and local economic conditions  particularly in the new york city and boston metropolitan regions  affect the levels of our national  classified and retail advertising revenues 
changes in spending patterns and priorities  including shifts in marketing strategies and budget cuts of key advertisers  in response to weak and uneven economic conditions  have depressed and may continue to depress our advertising revenues 
secular shift to digital media choices the competition for advertising revenues in various markets has intensified as a result of the continued development of digital media technologies 
we expect that technological developments will continue to favor digital media choices  adding to the challenges posed by audience fragmentation 
we have expanded and will continue to expand our digital offerings  however  a significant portion of our revenues are currently from traditional print products where advertising revenues are declining 
we believe that the shift from traditional media forms to a growing number of digital media choices and changing consumer behavior have contributed to  and is likely to continue to contribute to  a decline in print advertising 
the digital advertising marketplace has experienced significant downward pressure on advertising rates as a result of significant increases in inventory 
in addition  search technology has continued to improve the organization of and access to a broad range of web sites and online information  reshaping consumer behavior and expectations for consuming news and information 
as economic conditions and the advertising environment remain challenged  media companies have been re evaluating their business models  with some moving toward various forms of digital pay models that will depend on greater market acceptance and a shift in consumer attitudes 
the new york times company p 
circulation circulation is another significant source of revenue for us and an increasingly important driver as the overall composition of our revenues is shifting in response to the transformations in our industry 
circulation revenues are affected by circulation and readership levels 
in recent years  our newspaper properties  and the newspaper industry as a whole  have experienced declining print circulation volume 
this is due to  among other factors  increased competition from digital platforms and sources other than traditional newspapers often free to users  declining discretionary spending by consumers  higher subscription and single copy rates and a growing preference among some consumers for receiving their news from a variety of sources 
costs a significant portion of our costs are fixed  and therefore we are limited in our ability to reduce them in the short term 
our most significant costs are employee related costs and raw materials  which together accounted for approximately of our total operating costs in changes in employee related costs and the price and availability of newsprint can materially affect our operating results 
for a discussion of these and other factors that could affect our results of operations and financial condition  see forward looking statements and item a risk factors 
our strategy our results in reflect our ability to manage the business during a period of transformation for our industry and amidst weak and uneven economic conditions 
we anticipate that the challenges we currently face will continue  and we believe that the following elements are key to our efforts to address them 
diversifying our revenue streams and strengthening our digital businesses as the advertising marketplace has changed  we have focused on diversifying our revenue streams and strengthening our digital businesses to make us less susceptible to the inevitable economic cycles and to respond to the secular changes in our industry 
our digital businesses provide meaningful diversification during our transition to becoming an increasingly multiplatform company 
our goal is to grow our digital businesses by broadening our audiences  deepening engagement and further monetizing the usage of our web sites and across other digital platforms 
we are pursuing a multiplatform strategy across our company with new digital products and platforms  such as mobile  social media networks and reader application products 
during  we launched digital subscriptions at the times  the iht and the globe  with the intention of developing a new consumer revenue stream  while preserving our robust digital advertising business 
overall circulation revenues increased in compared with as the addition of digital subscription offerings at the times offset a decline in print copies sold across the news media group 
in addition  the rate of home delivery circulation volume declines moderated at the times due to an increase in new orders and improved retention rates following the launch of digital subscriptions at the times  as print subscribers receive all digital access for free 
as our news and content are being featured in an increasingly broad range of platforms and devices  we will continue to examine our circulation pricing and pay models in coordination with our overall multiplatform strategy  and to focus on building on our digital subscriber base and strengthening our digital businesses 
building on the strength of our brands because of our high quality journalism and content  we believe we have very powerful and trusted brands that attract educated  affluent and influential audiences 
as we continued to face weak and uneven economic conditions in and an increasingly fragmented media landscape  we focused on building on the strength of our brands  particularly the times 
we have significantly expanded our presence on new digital platforms  broadened our journalism and content and added new tools and multimedia features across our properties to increase the engagement of our users 
we are also focused on continuing to offer a premier environment for integrated brand advertising across platforms through advertising product innovation and our integrated print and digital sales structure 
in  the globe s digital strategy focused on the development of two distinct online brands to better serve the distinct audiences of the globe and boston 
com and a wide array of advertisers 
in september  the globe launched a new paid subscription site  bostonglobe 
com  which offers exclusive access to the full range and depth of p 
the new york times company content produced by the newspaper s journalists  in a format optimized for reading on a tablet  smartphone  laptop and desktop 
this new site complements boston 
com  a web site that previously offered all globe content and has now been enhanced as a community portal for the greater boston area 
the initial digital subscription numbers and the growth in digital advertising revenues at the news media group in reaffirm that advertisers and readers are embracing our high quality content across multiple platforms and underscore the value users place on our brands 
regardless of the distribution model of news and information  we remain committed to creating quality content and a quality user experience 
managing our expenses over the past few years as we transform and rebalance our business for the evolving media landscape  we have focused on realigning our cost base to ensure that we are operating our businesses as efficiently as possible  while maintaining our commitment to investing in high quality content and achieving our long term strategy 
in  we remained disciplined in our approach toward costs and focused on realigning our work force  even as we invested in new business models and other digital initiatives 
we reduced our operating costs by approximately million in and more than million since in  we expect costs to increase modestly for the first time in several years 
we plan to prudently increase spending in as we continue to invest in our digital capabilities and subscription acquisition efforts  invest in the about group s sales and marketing efforts and reset our variable compensation targets  even as we expect expense savings in our production and distribution operations and from further leveraging our centralized processes and resources 
managing expenses will remain a priority and we will continue to identify operational efficiencies across our organization  such as in our production and distribution operations and from further leveraging centralized processes and resources  and to respond to the ongoing secular changes in our industry 
rebalancing our portfolio of businesses over the past several years  we have been rebalancing our portfolio of businesses  focusing more on growth areas  such as digital 
we have focused on investing in our expanding digital operations  including our new business models and other digital initiatives 
we also continuously evaluate our businesses to determine whether they are meeting our targets for financial performance  growth and return on investment and whether they remain relevant to our strategy and align with our core purpose to enhance society by creating  collecting and distributing high quality news  information and entertainment 
during  we sold baseline and ucomparehealthcare 
com 
over the past two years  we have sold almost three quarters of our initial investment in fenway sports group and we continue to market our remaining units 
on january   we sold the regional media group for million in cash  subject to certain adjustments 
the sale of our regional media group will enable us to continue our transformation to a digitally focused multimedia news and information company 
improving our liquidity we have continued to manage our liquidity position by improving our financial flexibility and our debt profile 
over the past two years  we have taken decisive steps to strengthen our liquidity position 
with our strong cash flows from operations  along with proceeds from the sale of a portion of our interest in fenway sports group and a million private debt offering in november  we prepaid all million aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured notes due january  notes on august  eliminating this high interest debt from our balance sheet more than three years ahead of maturity has increased our financial flexibility  and we expect interest expense savings of more than million annually over the next three years 
at the end of  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million  even after prepaying the notes and making pension contributions totaling approximately million during the year 
our cash position further improved after the end of with the proceeds from the sale of the regional media group in january and the sale of of our units in fenway sports group in february our main priorities for cash in will be managing the underfunded levels of our pension plans and paying off our million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in september as of december   we had total debt and capital lease obligations of approximately million and total the new york times company p 
debt and capital lease obligations  net of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  or net debt  of approximately million 
we believe net debt provides a useful measure of our liquidity and overall debt position 
we have reduced our net debt by approximately million as of the end of from million at the end of as of december   we had total debt and capital lease obligations of approximately million and cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
by prepaying the notes more than three years ahead of maturity  we have improved our debt profile and the majority of our debt matures in or later 
in addition  in june  we entered into a new million asset backed five year revolving credit facility that replaced our million revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the new credit facility 
we believe our cash balance and cash provided by operations  in combination with other financing sources  will be sufficient to meet our financing needs over the next months 
managing our pension related obligations the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans has been adversely affected by the current interest rate environment  and required contributions for our qualified pension plans can have a significant effect on future cash flows 
for purposes of gaap  our qualified pension plans were underfunded meaning the present value of future obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets as of december   by approximately million  compared with approximately million as of december  the funded status of these pension plans was negatively affected primarily by the decline in interest rates in we expect to fund the majority of the shortfall over the next four to five years  although the balance could fluctuate significantly depending on interest rate movements and asset performance 
we made contributions totaling approximately million in to certain qualified pension plans  including million in contractual obligations to the new york times newspaper guild pension plan 
we have addressed our minimum funding requirements for and a significant portion for through discretionary contributions 
in connection with the sale of the regional media group  we will continue to retain pension assets and liabilities and postretirement obligations related to the regional media group s employees 
we expect to make mandatory contributions  primarily contractual contributions in connection with the new york times newspaper guild pension plan  of approximately million in and we may make discretionary contributions in to our company sponsored qualified pension plans depending on cash flows  pension asset performance  interest rates and other factors 
we have taken a number of other steps to manage our pension related obligations 
in the last two years  we have frozen accruals under certain qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover the majority of our employees  including our non union pension plan and certain qualified pension plans in connection with collective bargaining agreements 
for such frozen pension plans  any actuarial gains and losses from interest rate changes and asset performance are amortized over a longer period of time 
as a result  we do not expect that such changes will have a significant impact on pension expense in relative to we also remain focused on managing our multiemployer pension plans 
certain of our cost management efforts have created significant withdrawal obligations under the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate  such as the liability assessed against us in in connection with amendments to various collective bargaining agreements affecting certain multiemployer pension plans 
however  we believe these withdrawals are an important step to address pension obligations that we projected could otherwise have continued to grow over time 
p 
the new york times company outlook we remain in a challenging business environment  reflecting continuing uncertainty in economic conditions  and an increasingly competitive landscape 
advertising revenues continue to be affected by the slow economic recovery and visibility remains limited 
to date in the first quarter of  digital advertising at the news media group is trending below the level of the fourth quarter of thus  for the overall company we expect total advertising revenue trends for the first quarter of to be slightly below the level of the fourth quarter of total circulation revenues are projected to increase in the high single digits in the first quarter of as we expect to benefit from our digital subscription initiatives  as well as from the print circulation price increase at the times implemented in the first quarter of we expect operating costs to increase in the low single digits in the first quarter of in addition  we expect the following on a pre tax basis in depreciation and amortization to million  which includes approximately million of accelerated depreciation  primarily in the first quarter  associated with the consolidation of most of the t g s printing into the globe s facility in boston  mass  beginning in the second quarter of  interest expense  net to million  capital expenditures to million  and results from joint ventures to million 
effective with the sale of of our units in fenway sports group in february  given our reduced ownership level and lack of influence on the operations of fenway sports group  we will change the accounting for our investment from the equity method to the cost method 
therefore  we will no longer recognize our proportionate share of the operating results of fenway sports group in income from joint ventures in our consolidated statements of operations

operating costs for corporate decreased in compared with primarily due to lower professional fees million and benefits and compensation costs million  offset in part by a one time benefit from the sale of an asset million in the second quarter of other items impairment of assets in  we recorded a million impairment charge 
at the news media group  the impairment consisted of the write down of goodwill at the regional media group of million and the write down of certain assets held for sale  primarily of baseline  totaling million 
at the about group  the impairment consisted of a write down of an intangible asset at consumersearch  inc of million 
regional media group goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually or in an interim period if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist 
our policy is to perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
however  due to certain impairment indicators at the regional media group  including lower than expected operating results  we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill as of june  the regional media group is part of the news media group reportable segment 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the sale of the regional media group on january  the interim test resulted in an impairment of goodwill of million mainly from lower projected long term operating results and cash flows of the regional media group primarily due to the continued decline in print advertising revenues 
these factors resulted in the carrying value of the net assets being greater than their fair value  and therefore a write down to fair value was required 
the impairment charge reduced the carrying value of goodwill at the regional media group to zero 
in determining the fair value of the regional media group  we made significant judgments and estimates regarding the expected severity and duration of the uneven economic environment and the secular changes affecting the newspaper industry in the regional media group markets 
the effect of these assumptions on projected long term revenues  along with the continued benefits from reductions to the group s cost structure  played a significant role in calculating the fair value of the regional media group 
the new york times company p 
property  plant and equipment is tested for impairment if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist 
due to the factors discussed above  we completed an interim impairment test of property  plant and equipment as of june  the impairment test was completed at each newspaper asset group level with the lowest level of cash flows in the regional media group 
our test did not result in an impairment because the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows at each newspaper was greater than the carrying value of property  plant and equipment 
about group our annual impairment test  which was completed in the fourth quarter  resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million relating to the write down of an intangible asset at consumersearch  inc this impairment charge reduced the carrying value of the consumersearch trade name to approximately million 
the fair value of the trade name was calculated using a relief from royalty method 
the asset impairment was driven by lower cost per click advertising revenues 
there were no additional impairment charges in connection with our annual impairment test 
however  the about group s estimated fair value was greater than its carrying value in our impairment test compared with in our impairment test  a significant decline during the about group had approximately million of goodwill as of december  in determining the fair value of the about group  we made significant judgments and estimates regarding the expected recovery of display and cost per click advertising 
the effect of these assumptions on projected long term revenues  along with investments to grow content and traffic  play a significant role in calculating the fair value of the about group 
we believe if the long term projected cash flows of the about group are not met a goodwill impairment charge could be reasonably likely 
assets held for sale in the second quarter of  we classified certain assets as held for sale  primarily of baseline 
the carrying value of these assets was greater than their fair value  less cost to sell  resulting in an impairment of certain intangible assets and property totaling million 
the impairment charge reduced the carrying value of intangible assets to zero and the property to a nominal value 
the fair value for these assets was determined by estimating the most likely sale price with a third party buyer based on market data 
in october  we completed the sale of baseline  which resulted in a nominal gain 
we consolidated the printing facility of the globe in billerica  mass  into the boston  mass  printing facility in the second quarter of after exploring different opportunities for the assets at billerica  we entered into an agreement in the third quarter of to sell the majority of these assets to a third party 
therefore  assets with a carrying value of approximately million were written down to their fair value  resulting in a million impairment charge in in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge for an impairment of assets due to the reduced scope of a systems project at the news media group 
pension withdrawal expense over the past three years  certain events  such as amendments to various collective bargaining agreements  resulted in withdrawals from multiemployer pension plans 
these actions along with a reduction in covered employees have resulted in us estimating withdrawal liabilities to the respective plans for our proportionate share of any unfunded vested benefits 
we recorded an estimated charge for pension plan withdrawal obligations of million in  million in and million in our multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability was approximately million as of december  this liability is the present value of the obligations related to complete and partial withdrawals from certain plans as well as an estimate of future partial withdrawals that we considered probable and reasonably estimable 
the actual liability will not be known until each plan completes a final assessment of the withdrawal liability and issues a demand to us 
therefore  the estimate of our multiemployer pension plan liability will be adjusted as more information becomes available that allows us to refine our estimates 
p 
the new york times company pension curtailment gain we did not make any significant changes to our pension plans during or however  in  we made the following changes to certain of our pension plans  which resulted in a net pension curtailment gain of million

we also froze a non qualified pension plan that provides enhanced retirement benefits to select members of management 
the accrued benefits under this supplemental benefit plan were determined and frozen based on eligible earnings through december  the reduction of benefits under the qualified and non qualified plans mentioned above and various other non qualified plans resulted in a curtailment gain of million 
in  we also froze a company sponsored qualified pension plan in connection with ratified amendments to a collective bargaining agreement covering the newspaper guild of the globe

we will record a pre tax gain of approximately million in the first quarter of following the sale  we own units  or  of fenway sports group 
we continue to market our remaining units in fenway sports group  in whole or in parts 
effective with this sale  given our reduced ownership level and lack of influence on the operations of fenway sports group  we will change the accounting for our investment from the equity method to the cost method

the springing financial covenant provides that when availability under the new credit facility falls below the greater of million or of the commitment for three consecutive business days  we will be required to maintain on a trailing four quarter basis a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of ebitda as defined by the credit agreement minus unfinanced capital expenditures and tax payments paid in cash during the applicable period to fixed charges as defined by the credit agreement for such period

payments for these plans have been estimated over a year period  therefore the amounts included in the later years column only include payments for the period of while benefit payments under these plans are expected to continue beyond  we believe that an estimate beyond this period is impracticable

other liabilities other in our consolidated balance sheets include liabilities related to deferred compensation  primarily consisting of our deferred executive compensation plan the dec plan  our liability for uncertain tax positions  and various other liabilities 
these liabilities are not included in the table above primarily because the future payments are not determinable 
the dec plan enables certain eligible executives to elect to defer a portion of their compensation on a pre tax basis 
while the initial deferral period is for a minimum of two years up to a maximum of years after which time taxable distributions must begin  the executive has the option to extend the deferral period

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented 
we continually evaluate the policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 
we believe our critical accounting policies include our accounting for long lived assets  retirement benefits  stock based compensation  income taxes  self insurance liabilities and accounts receivable allowances 
specific risks related to our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
long lived assets we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets not amortized on an annual basis or in an interim period if certain circumstances indicate that a possible impairment may exist 
all other long lived assets are tested for impairment if certain circumstances indicate that a possible impairment exists 
in thousands december  december  long lived assets total assets percentage of long lived assets to total assets the impairment analysis is considered critical to our segments because of the significance of long lived assets to our consolidated balance sheets 
we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level  which are our operating segments 
separate financial information about these segments is regularly evaluated by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources 
we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
the result of this assessment determines whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment two step test 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  in the first step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
fair value is calculated by a combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market approach model 
in calculating fair value for each reporting unit  we generally weigh the results of the discounted cash flow model more heavily than the market approach because the discounted cash flow model is specific to our business and long term projections 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in the second step  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
the discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions  many of which are interdependent  about future revenues  operating margins  growth rates  capital expenditures  working capital and discount rates 
the starting point for the assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis is the annual long range financial forecast 
the annual planning process that we undertake to prepare the long range financial forecast takes into consideration a multitude of factors  including historical growth rates and operating performance  related industry trends  macroeconomic conditions  and marketplace data  among others 
assumptions are also made for perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long range financial forecast period 
our estimates of fair value are sensitive to changes in all of these variables  certain of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside our control 
the market approach analysis includes applying a multiple  based on comparable market transactions  to certain operating metrics of the reporting unit 
p 
the new york times company we compare the sum of the fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization to determine whether our estimates of reporting unit fair value are reasonable 
intangible assets that are not amortized trade names are tested for impairment at the asset level by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount 
fair value is calculated as the discounted cash flows utilizing the relief from royalty method 
this method is based on applying a royalty rate  which would be obtained through a lease  to the cash flows derived from the asset being tested 
the royalty rate is derived from market data 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  the asset is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the asset 
all other long lived assets intangible assets that are amortized  such as content and customer lists are tested for impairment at the asset group level associated with the lowest level of cash flows 
an impairment exists if the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable the carrying value of the asset is greater than the sum of undiscounted cash flows and is greater than its fair value 
the significant estimates and assumptions used by management in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  other intangible assets acquired and other long lived assets are estimated future cash flows  discount rates  growth rates  as well as other factors 
any changes in these estimates or assumptions could result in an impairment charge 
the estimates  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgment 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated results of the impairment tests can vary within a range of outcomes 
in addition to annual testing  management uses certain indicators to evaluate whether the carrying values of its long lived assets may not be recoverable and an interim impairment test may be required 
these indicators include current period operating or cash flow declines combined with a history of operating or cash flow declines or a projection forecast that demonstrates continuing declines in the cash flow or the inability to improve our operations to forecasted levels  a significant adverse change in the business climate  whether structural or technological and a decline in our stock price and market capitalization 
management has applied what it believes to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for its impairment testing 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
retirement benefits our single employer pension and other postretirement benefit costs are accounted for using actuarial valuations 
we recognize the funded status of these plans measured as the difference between plan assets  if funded  and the benefit obligation on the balance sheet and recognize changes in the funded status that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic pension cost  within other comprehensive income  net of income taxes 
the assets related to our funded pension plans are measured at fair value 
we consider accounting for retirement plans critical to all of our operating segments because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  which include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  long term return on plan assets and mortality rates 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the impact from our pension and other postretirement benefits could vary within a range of outcomes and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we also recognize the present value of pension liabilities associated with the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans 
see pensions and other postretirement benefits below for more information on our retirement benefits 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  and for certain awards at the end of each reporting period based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the appropriate vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or different key assumptions were used  it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial the new york times company p 
statements 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding stock based compensation expense 
income taxes we consider accounting for income taxes critical to our operations because management is required to make significant subjective judgments in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances that may be required against deferred tax assets 
income taxes are recognized for the following amount of taxes payable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using statutory tax rates and are adjusted for tax rate changes in the period of enactment 
we assess whether our deferred tax assets shall be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our process includes collecting positive eg  sources of taxable income and negative eg  recent historical losses evidence and assessing  based on the evidence  whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
this involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions  the evaluation of tax law and an assessment of whether a liability for uncertain tax positions is necessary 
different conclusions reached in this assessment can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which could require an extended period of time to resolve 
until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities  the timing and amount of a possible audit settlement for uncertain tax benefits is difficult to predict 
self insurance we self insure for workers compensation costs  automobile and general liability claims  up to certain deductible limits  as well as for certain employee medical and disability benefits 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks are primarily calculated using actuarial methods 
the liabilities include amounts for actual claims  claim growth and claims incurred but not yet reported 
actual experience  including claim frequency and severity as well as health care inflation  could result in different liabilities than the amounts currently recorded 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks were approximately million as of december  and million as of december  accounts receivable allowances credit is extended to our advertisers and subscribers based upon an evaluation of the customers financial condition  and collateral is not required from such customers 
we use prior credit losses as a percentage of credit sales  the aging of accounts receivable and specific identification of potential losses to establish reserves for credit losses on accounts receivable 
in addition  we establish reserves for estimated rebates  returns  rate adjustments and discounts based on historical experience 
in thousands december  december  accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable  net accounts receivable gross total current assets percentage of accounts receivable allowances to gross accounts receivable percentage of net accounts receivable to current assets we consider accounting for accounts receivable allowances critical to all of our operating segments because of the significance of accounts receivable to our current assets and operating cash flows 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

the new york times company pensions and other postretirement benefits we sponsor several single employer defined benefit pension plans  the majority of which have been frozen  participate in the new york times newspaper guild pension plan  a joint company and guild sponsored plan  and make contributions to several multiemployer pension plans in connection with collective bargaining agreements 
these plans cover the majority of our employees

these plans provide participating employees with retirement benefits in accordance with benefit formulas detailed in each plan 
our non qualified plans provide enhanced retirement benefits to select members of management 
the new york times newspaper guild pension plan is a qualified plan and is also included in the table below 
we also have a foreign based pension plan for certain iht employees the foreign plan 
the information for the foreign plan is combined with the information for us non qualified plans 
the benefit obligation of the foreign plan is immaterial to our total benefit obligation 
the funded status of our qualified and non qualified pension plans as of december  is as follows december  in thousands qualified plans non qualified plans all plans pension obligation fair value of plan assets pension underfunded unfunded obligation we made contributions of approximately million to certain qualified pension plans in the majority of these contributions were discretionary 
we expect to make mandatory contributions  primarily contractual contributions in connection with the new york times newspaper guild pension plan  of approximately million in we may make discretionary contributions in to our company sponsored qualified pension plans depending on cash flows  pension asset performance  interest rates and other factors 
pension expense is calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on assets for qualified plans and a discount rate 
our methodology in selecting these actuarial assumptions is discussed below 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on assets  we evaluated input from our investment consultants  actuaries and investment management firms  including our review of asset class return expectations  as well as long term historical asset class returns 
projected returns by such consultants and economists are based on broad equity and bond indices 
our objective is to select an average rate of earnings expected on existing plan assets and expected contributions to the plan during the year 
the expected long term rate of return determined on this basis was in our plan assets had a rate of return of approximately in and an average annual return of approximately over the three year period we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to meet our investment strategy 
the value market related value of plan assets is multiplied by the expected long term rate of return on assets to compute the expected return on plan assets  a component of net periodic pension cost 
the market related value of plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value over three years 
the new york times company p 
based on the composition of our assets at the beginning of the year  we estimated our expected long term rate of return to be  a decline from in if we had decreased our expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by basis points to in  pension expense would have increased by approximately million in for our qualified pension plans 
our funding requirements would not have been materially affected 
we determined our discount rate using a ryan alm  inc curve the ryan curve 
the ryan curve provides the bonds included in the curve and allows adjustments for certain outliers eg  bonds on watch 
we believe the ryan curve allows us to calculate an appropriate discount rate 
to determine our discount rate  we project a cash flow based on annual accrued benefits 
for active participants  the benefits under the respective pension plans are projected to the date of termination 
the projected plan cash flow is discounted to the measurement date  which is the last day of our fiscal year  using the annual spot rates provided in the ryan curve 
a single discount rate is then computed so that the present value of the benefit cash flow equals the present value computed using the ryan curve rates 
the discount rate determined on this basis was for our qualified plans and for our non qualified plans as of december  if we had decreased the expected discount rate by basis points to for our qualified plans and for our non qualified plans in  pension expense would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively  and as of december   our pension obligation would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
we will continue to evaluate all of our actuarial assumptions  generally on an annual basis  and will adjust as necessary 
actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates  the level of contributions we make and various other factors 
we also recognize the present value of pension liabilities associated with the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans 
our multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability was approximately million as of december  this liability is the present value of the obligations related to complete and partial withdrawals from certain plans as well as an estimate of future partial withdrawals that we considered probable and reasonably estimable 
the actual liability will not be known until each plan completes a final assessment of the withdrawal liability and issues a demand to us 
therefore  the estimate of our multiemployer pension plan liability will be adjusted as more information becomes available that allows us to refine our estimates 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension plans 
other postretirement benefits we provide health benefits to retired employees and their eligible dependents who meet the definition of an eligible participant and certain age and service requirements  as outlined in the plan document 
while we offer pre age retiree medical coverage to employees who meet certain retiree medical eligibility requirements  we no longer provide post age retiree medical benefits for employees who retire on or after march  we also contribute to a postretirement plan under the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement 
we accrue the costs of postretirement benefits during the employees active years of service and our policy is to pay our portion of insurance premiums and claims from our assets 
the annual postretirement expense was calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions  including a health care cost trend rate and a discount rate 
the health care cost trend rate decreased to as of december   from as of december  a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would result in an increase of million or a decrease of million in our service and interest costs  respectively  two factors included in the calculation of postretirement expense 
a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would result in an increase of approximately million or a decrease of approximately million  in our accumulated benefit obligation as of december  our discount rate assumption for postretirement benefits is consistent with that used in the calculation of pension benefits 
see pension benefits above for information on our discount rate assumption

the new york times company recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its guidance on goodwill impairment testing to reduce the cost and complexity of testing goodwill for impairment by providing the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
the result of this assessment will determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step test 
the provisions of this new guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted the new guidance early when we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb amended its guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items that are recorded in other comprehensive income 
the new accounting guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
the provisions of this guidance are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb amended its guidance related to fair value measurements in order to align the definition of fair value measurements and the related disclosure requirements between accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and international financial reporting standards 
these amendments  which are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   also change certain existing fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements 
we do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements

newsprint is a commodity subject to supply and demand market conditions 
we have equity investments in two paper mills  which provide a partial hedge against price volatility 
the cost of raw materials  of which newsprint expense is a major component  represented of our total operating costs in and based on the number of newsprint tons consumed in and  a per ton increase in newsprint prices would have resulted in additional newsprint expense of million pre tax in and million pre tax in a significant portion of our employees are unionized and our results could be adversely affected if labor negotiations were to restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations 
in addition  if we were to experience labor unrest  strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations  or if we are unable to negotiate labor contracts on reasonable terms  our ability to produce and deliver our most significant products could be impaired
