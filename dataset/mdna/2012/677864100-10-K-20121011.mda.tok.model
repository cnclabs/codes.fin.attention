item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include those discussed under forward looking statements and in item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
overview we develop  mine  manufacture and market sorbent products principally produced from clay minerals  primarily consisting of montmorillonite and attapulgite and  to a lesser extent  other clay like sorbent materials  such as antelope shale 
our principal products include cat litter  industrial and automotive floor absorbents  fluids purification and filtration bleaching clays  agricultural and horticultural chemical carriers  animal health and nutrition products and sports field products 
our products are sold to two primary customer groups  including customers who resell our products as originally produced to the end consumer and those who use our products as part of their production process or use them as an ingredient in their final finished product 
we have two reportable operating segments based on the different characteristics of our two primary customer groups retail and wholesale products group and business to business products group 
each operating segment is discussed individually below 
additional detailed descriptions of the operating segments are included in item business above 
beginning in fiscal  our sports field products were moved to the retail and wholesale products group to reflect a change in management organization intended to better serve our customers 
prior year segment information has been restated to reflect this change 
our fiscal operating results reflect increased net sales in several markets  however  certain events resulted in one time charges that negatively impacted earnings 
consolidated net sales for the year ended july  were  a increase from net sales of  in fiscal net sales increased in both our retail and wholesale products and business to business products operating segments 
consolidated net income was  or per diluted share  for the year ended july   a decrease from net income of  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  throughout fiscal  promotional expenditures were substantial for our cat s pride fresh light products  which were launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal we incurred a one time charge in our fourth quarter to relocate the manufacturing of specific products from our plant located in illinois to our plants located in mississippi in order to improve production efficiencies 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the production relocation charge 
in addition  during fiscal we experienced certain cost increases to produce  package and transport our products  which more than offset the lower cost of fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
we expect transportation cost increases to continue due to recent trends and regulations in the freight industry 
we also continued to invest in our capital assets and maintained a strong consolidated balance sheet during fiscal results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july  were  a increase from net sales of  in fiscal net sales increased for both our business to business products group and our retail and wholesale products group due to increased net selling prices and a favorable product sales mix  defined as a greater proportion of sales from higher priced products 
our business to business products group also benefited from an increase in tons sold 
consolidated net income for fiscal was  a decrease from net income of  in fiscal the decline in net income was driven 
table of contents primarily by increased advertising expenditures in the retail and wholesale products group and a one time charge to relocate our industrial floor absorbent and cat litter products from our facility located in mounds  illinois to our plants located in mississippi 
in addition  during fiscal we experienced higher freight  packaging and material costs for both operating segments and higher non fuel manufacturing costs  which outweighed the benefit of lower cost for fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
segment operating income increased for the the business to business products group and decreased for the retail and wholesale products group as discussed below 
business to business products group net sales of the business to business products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal the increase in net sales was attributed to a increase in tons sold  a favorable product sales mix and higher net selling prices 
net sales of agricultural and horticultural products  fluid purification products and animal health products all increased  while net sales of co packaged cat litter decreased 
net sales of agricultural and horticultural products increased approximately due to more tons sold  a favorable product sales mix and higher net selling prices 
sales increased to agricultural chemical carrier formulators 
sales also increased to customers for our engineered granule product in the professional pesticides and agricultural markets 
net sales of fluid purification products increased approximately from fiscal with a increase in tons sold 
sales in domestic and some export markets improved due to new customers and increased sales to existing customers 
net sales of animal health and nutrition products increased approximately due to a favorable product sales mix and more tons sold 
higher sales of our newer enterosorbent animal health products in foreign markets resulted from improved distribution and new product registration in certain countries 
the increased sales of our newer enterosorbent products considerably outweighed a decline in sales of our longer established animal health products 
our co packaged traditional coarse cat litter net sales decreased due to the continued decline in the coarse cat litter segment of the market 
the business to business products group s operating income was  in fiscal  an increase of  or  from operating income of  in fiscal this increase was driven by the higher net selling prices and favorable product sales mix described above  which was partially offset by higher freight and materials costs per ton 
freight costs increased approximately due primarily to higher diesel fuel prices and other cost increases in the freight industry  which are expected to continue due to recent trends and regulations 
material costs increased approximately due to higher non fuel manufacturing costs  which exceeded a reduction in the cost of fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
see further discussion of manufacturing costs under consolidated results below 
the business to business products group s selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were even with fiscal retail and wholesale products group net sales of the retail and wholesale products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal the increase in net sales was attributed to a favorable product sales mix and higher net selling prices  which more than offset a decline in tons sold 
net sales increased for our cat litter products  but decreased for our foreign subsidiaries  as described under foreign operations below 
net sales for our industrial absorbent products were even with the prior year 
cat litter net sales increased approximately due to a favorable product sales mix and higher net selling prices  which outweighed a decrease in tons sold 
branded cat litter net sales increased approximately with more tons sold 
branded cat litter sales improved due primarily to our cat s pride fresh light scoopable products  which were introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  combined with higher sales of our established cat s pride scoopable products 
the increase in branded cat litter net sales was partially offset by approximately lower sales of private label cat litter 
the decline in private label cat litter sales resulted from the continued decline in the coarse cat litter market  as well as a market trend away from private label cat litter products 
the retail and wholesale products group s segment operating income for fiscal was  a decrease of  or  from operating income of  in fiscal the decrease was driven primarily by increased advertising costs for our cat s pride fresh light cat litter 
in addition  the retail and wholesale group s combined freight  packaging and material costs increased approximately compared to fiscal packaging costs increased due to fluctuations in the price of paper and resin 
freight costs increased approximately as a result of higher diesel fuel prices and other cost increases in the freight industry  which we expect to continue due to recent trends and regulations 
material costs increased approximately due primarily to increased purchases of additives  fragrances and other materials for the production of scoopable cat litters 
these cost increases more than offset the lower cost of fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
see further discussion of manufacturing costs under consolidated results below 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the retail and wholesale products group increased compared to fiscal due primarily to increased advertising expenditures described above 
advertising and promotions spending in fiscal 
table of contents is anticipated to be less than in fiscal  but will remain higher than historic levels 
consolidated results consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal increased to from in fiscal gross profit improved because of the higher sales described above  a greater proportion of sales from higher margin products and lower costs for fuel  primarily natural gas  used to operate kilns that dry our clay 
partially offsetting these positive impacts were higher packaging  freight and material costs 
the increase in packaging and freight costs are described in the operating segment discussions above 
material costs were negatively impacted by a increase in non fuel manufacturing cost per ton produced  including depreciation and amortization 
the increase in non fuel manufacturing costs was attributed to higher depreciation expense and increased manufacturing of products that required purchased additives  fragrances and other materials 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the discussions of each segment s operating income above describes the increased selling  general and administrative expenses that were allocated to the operating segments  including approximately  higher advertising costs in the retail and wholesale products group 
the remaining unallocated corporate expenses in fiscal included a higher estimated annual incentive plan bonus accrual and higher costs for the supplemental employee retirement plan 
the incentive bonus expense was based on performance targets that are established for each fiscal year 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the supplemental employee retirement plan 
our effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal compared to in fiscal during fiscal  we generated an additional  in alternative minimum tax credits amt based on the fiscal tax return as filed 
consistent with amt credits generated in prior years  we recorded a full valuation allowance against these credits  which increased the fiscal effective tax rate 
this increase was partially offset by a higher deduction for tax mining depletion 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our income taxes 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july  were  a increase from net sales of  in fiscal net sales increased for our business to business products group and our retail and wholesale products group as discussed below 
net income for fiscal was  a decrease from net income of  in fiscal net income was negatively impacted by a decrease in tons sold for both of our operating segments  higher costs for freight  packaging and materials and increased spending for product market research and promotion development 
these negative factors outweighed the favorable affects of increased net selling prices  an increased proportion of sales from products with a higher net selling price and a lower cost for fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
segment operating income declined for both the retail and wholesale and the business to business products groups as discussed below 
business to business products group net sales of the business to business products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal a higher average net selling price in fiscal more than offset a decrease in tons sold compared to fiscal net sales of agricultural and horticultural products  fluid purification products and animal health products all increased  while net sales of co packaged cat litter decreased 
net sales of agricultural and horticultural products increased with approximately more tons sold 
our traditional agricultural chemical carrier products tons sold increased in fiscal after the downturn in the agricultural chemical carriers market during fiscal our new engineered granule product  that was introduced late in fiscal  also provided incremental sales in the professional pesticides and agricultural markets for fiscal net sales of fluid purification products increased from fiscal with a increase in tons sold 
sales in some export and domestic markets improved for fluid purification products used in edible oil and recycled oil processing  however  sales of our products used for biodiesel processing declined 
net sales of animal health and nutrition products rose in fiscal as a higher average net selling price outweighed a decrease in tons sold 
product registration in new countries  including china  opened additional markets during fiscal  however  sales in certain existing foreign markets were temporarily disrupted during the year due to implementation of new distribution processes 
in addition  our co packaged traditional coarse cat litter net sales decreased as the coarse cat litter market continued to decline as a whole 
the business to business products group s operating income was  in fiscal  a decrease of  or  from operating income of  in fiscal this decrease was driven by an increase of approximately for combined freight  packaging and material costs 
freight costs increased approximately due primarily to higher diesel fuel prices 
packaging costs increased due to fluctuations in the price of paper and resin 
material costs increased approximately 
table of contents as higher non fuel manufacturing costs more than offset the lower cost of fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
see further discussion of manufacturing costs under consolidated results below 
the business to business products group s selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were even with fiscal retail and wholesale products group net sales of the retail and wholesale products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal the segments s net sales benefited from higher average net selling prices and a greater proportion of sales from higher priced products  which more than offset a decrease in tons sold 
sales increased for both cat litter and industrial absorbent products 
these increases outweighed a decrease in sales by our foreign subsidiaries  which is described under foreign operations below 
cat litter net sales increased approximately due to a higher average net selling price and a greater proportion of sales from higher priced products 
net sales of branded cat litter increased approximately due to more tons sold and lower trade spending 
sales to walmart increased during fiscal as our branded scoopable litter was reinstated following the reduction in the number of cat litter brands carried  including ours  in the first quarter of fiscal we also introduced our new cat s pride fresh light product in the fourth quarter of fiscal net sales of private label cat litter decreased approximately compared to fiscal as the coarse cat litter market continued to decline as a whole 
sales of cat litter box liners increased due primarily to increased distribution to existing customers 
net sales of industrial absorbents increased approximately compared to fiscal the increase in sales was due primarily to selling price increases that outweighed a decline in tons sold 
the retail and wholesale products group s segment operating income for fiscal was  a decrease of  or  from operating income of  in fiscal this decrease was driven by higher costs  which more than offset the increased net sales described above 
the segment s combined freight  packaging and material costs increased approximately compared to fiscal freight costs increased approximately due primarily to higher diesel fuel prices 
packaging costs increased due to fluctuations in the price of paper and resin 
material costs increased approximately as higher non fuel manufacturing costs more than offset the lower cost of fuel used in manufacturing 
see further discussion of manufacturing costs under consolidated results below 
the retail and wholesale products group s selling  general and administrative expenses increased compared to fiscal due primarily to significant spending for new product market research and promotion development 
during fiscal  we made substantial outlays for capital investment and for market research and promotion development related to our new cat s pride fresh light product launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal consolidated results consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal decreased to from in fiscal gross profit was negatively impacted by increased costs for freight  packaging and materials 
the increase in packaging and freight costs are described in the operating segment discussions above 
material costs were negatively impacted by a increase in non fuel manufacturing cost per ton produced  which included depreciation and amortization 
this cost increase was driven primarily by increased manufacturing of products that required purchased additives  fragrances and other materials 
labor and employee benefit costs also increased compared to the prior year 
these cost increases exceeded the benefit from a lower cost of fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
we use natural gas  recycled oil and coal in the manufacturing process to operate kilns that dry our clay 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the discussions of each segment s operating income above describes the increased selling and administrative expenses that were allocated to the operating segments 
the remaining unallocated corporate expenses in fiscal included a lower estimated annual incentive plan bonus accrual 
the incentive bonus expense was based on performance targets that are established for each fiscal year 
the lower bonus expense was partially offset by higher depreciation expense for computer software and equipment  additional compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and increased spending for research and development 
interest expense in fiscal increased  from fiscal interest expense increased due primarily to the discontinued capitalization of interest for a capital project and additional interest on new debt issued in the second quarter of fiscal interest income in fiscal decreased  from fiscal due to less interest earned on a lease receivable  which exceeded the additional interest received on higher average investment balances at a slightly higher average interest rate 
net other income in fiscal decreased  from fiscal due to a reduction in lease income related to a lease arrangement with a co packaging partner and regulatory expense accruals 

table of contents our effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate was lower in fiscal due to the net impact of foreign tax attributes 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign operations net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal were  a decrease of  or  from net sales of  during fiscal net sales by our foreign subsidiaries represented of our consolidated net sales during fiscal year net sales declined for our united kingdom subsidiary and for our canadian subsidiary 
bleaching earth and industrial absorbents sales by our united kingdom subsidiary decreased due to a strong competitive and price sensitive marketplace 
both branded and private label cat litter sales for our canadian subsidiary were lower due to the continued decline in the coarse litter market and increased competition 
industrial product sales for our canadian subsidiary were relatively flat 
for fiscal  our foreign subsidiaries reported a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal the increase in the net loss was due primarily to lower sales  which were partially offset by a reduction in overhead costs at both our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries 
identifiable assets of our foreign subsidiaries as of july  were  compared to  as of july  the decrease is primarily due to lower accounts receivable 
net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal were  a decrease of  or  from net sales of  during fiscal net sales by our foreign subsidiaries represented of our consolidated net sales during fiscal year net sales declined for our united kingdom subsidiary and for our canadian subsidiary 
bleaching earth and industrial absorbents sales by our united kingdom subsidiary declined in a strong competitive and price sensitive marketplace 
industrial product sales for our canadian subsidiary were relatively flat and cat litter sales were lower due to the loss of a customer and lower sales to existing customers 
the impact of these sales declines was lessened by the relative strength of the canadian dollar and british pound compared to the us dollar 
the canadian dollar was about stronger on average and the british pound was about stronger on average against the us dollar during fiscal compared to fiscal  which resulted in higher sales values after translation to us dollars 
for fiscal  our foreign subsidiaries reported a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal the increase in the net loss was due primarily to lower sales and increased costs for freight and purchased materials  which were partially offset by the foreign currency exchange gain described above 
identifiable assets of our foreign subsidiaries as of july  were  compared to  as of july  the increase is primarily due to higher accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents  which were partially offset by lower inventories and prepaid taxes 
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs  purchasing and upgrading real estate  equipment and facilities  investing in infrastructure and potential acquisitions 
we have principally used cash generated from operations and  to the extent needed  issuance of debt securities and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund these requirements 
cash and cash equivalents totaled   and  at july   and  respectively

the changes in the primary components of working capital and other accounts that impacted operating cash flows for these years are as follows deferred income taxes were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to a higher postretirement benefits liability  benefits from a tax net operating loss and increased accrued expenses  which were partially offset by the impact of higher tax bonus depreciation expense 
deferred income taxes were  lower at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to lower accrued expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expense 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding income taxes and postretirement benefit plans  respectively 
the change in accrued expenses is discussed below 
accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end the increase was attributed primarily to higher fiscal fourth quarter sales compared to fiscal fourth quarter sales 
accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end the increase was due primarily to higher fiscal fourth quarter sales compared to fiscal fourth quarter sales 
the change in both periods is subject to timing of sales and collections and the payment terms provided to various customers 
inventories were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end inventories of additives and fragrances increased to meet production requirements for certain products 
inventories were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end finished goods and packaging inventories were up at fiscal year end due primarily to higher costs 
purchased materials inventories were also up due to cost increases and the mix of products produced 
prepaid expenses were  lower at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to a decrease in prepaid income taxes and lower prepaid advertising costs 
prepaid expenses were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to an increase in prepaid income taxes and higher prepaid advertising costs 
other assets were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end other assets were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end the change in other assets for both periods included the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations on non cash assets held by our foreign subsidiaries

in addition  capitalized costs related to the issuance of new debt contributed to the increase in fiscal accounts payable were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to increased trade accounts payable 
accounts payable were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to an increased trade accounts payable  which was partially offset by lower income taxes payable 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes 
changes in trade accounts payable in all periods are also subject to normal fluctuations in the timing of payments 
accrued expenses were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end accrued expenses for fiscal were higher for both the discretionary bonus and advertising expenses 
this increase was partially offset by lower other accrued operating expenses due to the lower cost of fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
accrued expenses were 
table of contents  lower at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end accrued expenses included a lower discretionary bonus accrual for fiscal this decrease was partially offset by increased accrued freight and other accrued operating expenses due to higher freight costs 
changes in accrued expenses in all periods are also subject to normal fluctuations in the timing of payments 
deferred compensation was  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end and was  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal the change in both years was due to employee deferrals and interest on accumulated deferred compensation balances that exceeded payouts

in fiscal  dispositions of investment securities exceeded purchases by  purchases and dispositions of investment securities in both periods are subject to variations in the timing of investment maturities 
cash used for capital expenditures of  in fiscal included new product related projects at our manufacturing facilities  replacement of machinery and land purchases 
capital expenditures for the same period in fiscal of  included approximately  to purchase land and mineral rights near our georgia production plant

proceeds from issuance of common stock and treasury stock related to stock option exercises were  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
other total cash and investment balances held by our foreign subsidiaries at july   and were   and  respectively 
cash and investment balances fluctuated due to normal business operations 
we have a  unsecured revolving credit agreement with bmo harris bank na bmo harris which will expire december  the credit agreement provides that we may select a variable rate based on either bmo harris prime rate or a libor based rate  plus a margin which varies depending on our debt to earnings ratio  or a fixed rate as agreed between us and bmo harris 
the credit agreement also allows us to obtain foreign letters of credit when necessary 
at july   the variable rates would have been for bmo harris prime based rate or for libor based rate 
the credit agreement 
table of contents contains restrictive covenants that  among other things and under various conditions  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to dispose of assets 
the agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth 
as of july  and  there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and we were in compliance with its covenants 
on november   we sold at aggregate face value  in senior promissory notes to the prudential insurance company of america  prudential retirement insurance and annuity company  forethought life insurance company  physicians mutual insurance company and bcbsm  inc dba blue cross and blue shield of minnesota pursuant to a note agreement dated november  the note agreement 
the notes bear interest at per annum and mature on august  the proceeds of the sale may be used to fund future principal payments of our debt  acquisitions  stock repurchases  capital expenditures and for working capital purposes 
the note agreement contains certain covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to  among other things  i incur liens  ii incur indebtedness  iii merge or consolidate  iv sell assets  v sell stock of those certain subsidiaries  vi engage in business that would change the general nature of the business we are engaged in  and vii enter into transactions other than on arm s length terms with affiliates 
we believe that cash flow from operations  availability under our current revolving credit facility and current cash and investment balances will provide adequate cash funds for foreseeable working capital needs  capital expenditures at existing facilities and debt service obligations for at least the next months 
we expect cash requirements for capital expenditures in fiscal to be higher than in fiscal due to projects at our manufacturing facilities  however  we expect the increase in capital expenditures to be more than offset by a reduction in spending for advertising  as described in results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal above 
our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
our ability to fund operations  to make planned capital expenditures  to make scheduled debt payments and to remain in compliance with all of the financial covenants under debt agreements  including the current credit agreement and any successor agreements  depends on our future operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors 
the timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that we complete may also impact our cash requirements 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at july  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations in the third quarter of fiscal  we made a contribution of approximately  to our defined benefit pension plan 
we have not presented this obligation for future years in the table above because the funding requirement can vary from year to year based on changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial assumptions 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for certain information regarding the potential impact of financial market fluctuations on pension plan assets and future funding contributions 
amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts committed less than year years years after years other commercial commitments the obligations above are open purchase orders primarily for packaging and other ingredients used in our products 
the expected timing of payments of these obligations is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities 
as of july  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
the term off balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party  under which we have i any obligation arising under a guarantee contract  derivative instrument or variable interest  or ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support for such assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the united states 
we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies annually to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies stated in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the policies listed below involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates include promotional programs  allowance for doubtful accounts  pension accounting and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
trade receivables 
we recognize trade receivables when the risk of loss and title pass to the customer 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience and a periodic review of our accounts receivable  including a review of the overall aging of accounts and analysis of specific accounts 
a customer account is determined to be uncollectible when we have completed our internal collection procedures  including termination of shipments  direct customer contact and formal demand of payment 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonable  however  the unanticipated default by a customer with a material trade receivable could occur 
we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  at july  and  respectively 
inventories 
we value inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory costs include the cost of raw materials  packaging supplies  labor and other overhead costs 
we perform a detailed review of our inventory items to determine if an obsolescence reserve adjustment is necessary 
the review surveys all of our operating facilities and sales divisions to ensure that both historical issues and new market trends are considered 
the obsolescence reserve not only considers specific items  but also takes into consideration the overall value of the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
the inventory obsolescence reserve values at july  and were  and  respectively 
reclamation 
during the normal course of our mining process we remove overburden and perform on going reclamation activities 
as overburden is removed from a pit  it is hauled to a previously mined pit and used to refill older sites 
this process allows us to continuously reclaim older pits and dispose of overburden simultaneously  therefore minimizing the liability of the reclamation process 
on an annual basis we evaluate our potential reclamation liability in accordance with asc  asset retirement and environmental obligations 
as of july  and  we have recorded an estimated net reclamation asset of  and  respectively  and a corresponding estimated reclamation liability of  and  respectively 
these values represent the discounted present value of the estimated future mining reclamation costs at the production plants 
the reclamation assets are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the various mines 
the reclamation liabilities are increased based on a yearly accretion charge  once again over the estimated useful lives of the mines 
accounting for reclamation obligations requires that we make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in the future could significantly differ from estimated amounts 
future changes to environmental laws could increase the extent of reclamation work required 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amount incurred for reclamation costs 
impairment of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets 
we review carrying values of goodwill  trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets periodically for possible impairment in accordance asc  intangibles goodwill 
table of contents and other 
our impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume  revenue  expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
impairment occurs when the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
our impairment analysis is performed in the first quarter of the fiscal year and when indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological changes  competitive activities and acts by governments and courts indicate that an asset may become impaired 
we use judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired 
our analysis in the first quarter of fiscal did not indicate any impairment 
we continue to monitor events  circumstances or changes in the business that might imply a reduction in value and might lead to impairment 
trade promotions 
we routinely commit to one time or ongoing trade promotion programs in our retail and wholesale products group 
promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives made directly to consumers  such as coupons  and sales incentives made to customers  such as slotting  discounts based on sales volume  cooperative marketing programs and other arrangements 
all such trade promotion costs are netted against sales 
promotional reserves are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
to estimate trade promotion reserves  we rely on our historical experience with trade spending patterns and that of the industry  current trends and forecasted data 
while we believe our promotional reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made  estimated amounts could differ from future obligations 
we have accrued liabilities at the end of each period for the estimated trade spending programs 
we recorded liabilities of  and  for trade promotions at july  and  respectively 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock options and restricted stock issued under our long term incentive plans in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
asc requires the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation at the grant date and the recognition in the financial statements of the related compensation expense over the appropriate vesting period 
the fair value of stock options was estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing method 
this method requires management to make certain estimates  including estimating the expected term of stock options  expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or different key assumptions were used 
we recognized stock based compensation expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal  net of related tax effect 
these amounts include expense related to both stock option grants and restricted stock awards 
pension and postretirement benefit costs 
we calculate our pension and postretirement health benefit obligations and the related effects on results of operations using actuarial models 
to measure the expense and obligations  we must make a variety of estimates including critical assumptions for the discount rate used to value certain liabilities and the expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions involving demographic factors  such as retirement age  mortality and turnover  are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect actual experience 
as these assumptions change from period to period  recorded pension and postretirement health benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
the discount rate is the rate assumed to measure the single amount that  if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high quality debt instruments  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the pension benefits when due 
the discount rate is subject to change each year 
we refer to an applicable index and the expected duration of the benefit payments to select a discount rate at which we believe the benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate was the single equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as the plan s expected cashflows discounted with spot rates on a yield curve of investment grade corporate bonds 
the yield curve is the citigroup pension liability index 
our determination of pension expense or income is based on a market related valuation of plan assets  which is the fair market value 
our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations and historical experience 
the expected long term rate of inflation and risk premiums for the various asset categories are based on general historical returns and inflation rates 
the target allocation of assets is used to develop a composite rate of return assumption 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we determine our current and deferred taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
the tax effect of the expected reversal of tax differences is recorded at rates currently enacted for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
to the extent that temporary differences will result in future tax benefit  we must estimate the timing of their reversal and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any deferred tax assets 
we maintain valuation allowances where it 
table of contents is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the income tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  we take into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings and other factors that could affect the realization of deferred tax assets 
we recorded valuation allowances for income taxes of  and  at july  and  respectively 
the valuation allowance at july  has been established for the full amount of the deferred tax benefit related to our alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards since we believe it is more likely than not that the benefit of these credits will not be realized 
in addition to valuation allowances  we provide for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet certain recognition thresholds or measurement standards 
amounts for uncertain tax positions are adjusted when new information becomes available or when positions are effectively settled 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on tax positions related to the current and prior fiscal years were  at both july  and see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
new accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting standards in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance under asc  fair value measurements and disclosures improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance requires new disclosures related to level fair value measurements  however  no new disclosures were required during fiscal since we have no financial assets or liabilities with this fair value classification 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we adopted fasb guidance issued under asc  fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
in accordance with the new requirements  we provided enhanced disclosure about the measurement of the estimated fair value of debt 
there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting this new guidance 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued guidance under asc  comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income  that requires presentation of the components of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate consecutive statements 
the requirements eliminate the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity 
the components recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance will not change 
the presentation requirements will be adopted beginning with our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ending october  and will be applied retrospectively 
in september  the fasb issued guidance under asc  testing goodwill for impairment  that provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if the annual two step test of goodwill for impairment must be performed 
if  based on the qualitative assessment of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the goodwill fair value is less than its carrying amount  then it is not necessary to perform the two step impairment test 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then the two step impairment test must be performed to identify potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
we will consider the option provided in this guidance for our annual goodwill impairment testing for our fiscal year and believe there will be no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued guidance under asc  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  that provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the second  quantitative impairment test 
if  based on the qualitative assessment of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset s fair value is less than its carrying amount  then it is not necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then the quantitative impairment test must also be performed to identify and measure any potential impairment amount 
we are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing for our fiscal year beginning august  
table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk and employ policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the market risk of our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that the market risk arising from holdings of our financial instruments is not material 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation risk  primarily us dollar british pound  us dollar euro and us dollar canadian dollar  as it relates to certain accounts receivables and to our foreign operations 
we are subject to translation exposure of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements 
in recent years  our foreign subsidiaries have not generated a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales or net income 
in addition  a small portion of our consolidated accounts receivable are denominated in foreign currencies 
during fiscal  we entered into two derivative contracts to reduce exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro compared to the us dollar 
these contracts expired prior to july  and no transactions were executed per the contractual terms because exchange rates did not fluctuate outside the stated levels 
we believe that the overall foreign currency fluctuation risk is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
we are exposed to market risk at it relates to the investments of plan assets under our defined benefit pension plan 
the fair value of these assets is subject to change due to fluctuations in the financial markets 
a lower asset value may increase our pension expense and may increase the amount and accelerate the timing of future funding contributions 
we are exposed to regulatory risk in the fluids purification  agricultural and animal health markets  principally as a result of the risk of increasing regulation of the food chain throughout the world  but particularly in the united states and europe 
we actively monitor developments in this area  both directly and through trade organizations of which we are a member 
we are exposed to commodity price risk with respect to fuel 
factors that could influence the cost of natural gas used in the kilns to dry our clay include the creditworthiness of our natural gas suppliers  the overall general economy  developments in world events  general supply and demand for natural gas  seasonality and the weather patterns throughout the united states and the world 
we monitor fuel market trends and we may contract for a portion of our anticipated fuel needs using forward purchase contracts to mitigate the volatility of our kiln fuel prices 
natural gas prices have remained relatively stable over the past twelve months  therefore  as of july   we have purchased no natural gas contracts for our planned kiln fuel needs for fiscal we continue to purchase natural gas at spot rates on a month to month basis 
please also see item a risk factors above for a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties we face in our business
