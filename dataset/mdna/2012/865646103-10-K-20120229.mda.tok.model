item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts are in thousands of us dollars  except share and per share data the following discussion is intended to assist in the assessment of significant changes and trends related to our results of operations and financial condition 
the information contained in this section has been derived from our consolidated financial statements and should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
readers are also encouraged to review and consider our disclosures describing various factors that could affect our business  including the disclosures under the heading risk factors in this report 
company overview we are a designer  marketer  and distributor of branded juvenile health  safety and wellness products which are sold principally to large north american and united kingdom retailers 
we currently market proprietary products in various product categories including nursery audio video monitors  safety gates  durable bath products  bed rails  infant thermometers  related health and safety products  booster and potty seats  cribs  baby gear  bouncers  feeding items  and swaddling blankets 
our business has grown organically in all of our markets 
we derive our revenues from the sale of health  safety and wellness products for infants and toddlers 
our revenue is driven by our ability to design and market desirable products  identify business opportunities and secure new and renew existing distribution channels 
our income from operations is derived from our ability to generate revenue and collect cash in excess of labor and other costs of providing our products and selling  general and administrative costs 
our strategy is to grow our sales through a variety of methods  including increased product penetration more products at each store  increased store penetration more stores within each retail customer  new products at existing and new customers  new mass merchant retail customers  new distribution channels food and drug chains  price clubs  home centers  web based retailers  new geographies international expansion  new product categories  and acquisitions 
we have been able to grow our annual revenues historically through a combination of all of the above factors 
each year  we have been able to expand the number of products in our main distribution channel mass merchant retailers and have also added new customers each year 
therefore  even with limited new product introductions  we could grow our business by simply selling more of our existing product line to existing customers 
in the future  our growth strategy will be to continue to develop and sell new products to our existing customer base  sell new and existing products to new customers or expand relationships with existing customers and expand in the united kingdom and in other geographic regions including japan  mexico and australia  among others 
in addition  there are a number of potential acquisition candidates that could be pursued to obtain new innovative products  new product categories  new retail customers or new sales territories 
there are several hundred active juvenile product companies  of which we estimate the majority have less than million in sales 

table of contents as we continue to grow through internal initiatives and any future acquisitions  we will incur additional expenses 
two of the key areas in which those increased expenses will likely occur are sales and product development 
to grow sales  we will likely hire additional sales personnel to service new geographic territories  focus existing resources on specific parts of the united states market and retain product line specialists to drive sales of new and existing products in specific areas in which we believe we can readily increase sales 
product development expenses will increase as we develop new products in existing and new categories 
if we were to acquire one or more companies as part of our growth strategy  we would face various challenges such as the integration of the acquired companies product lines  employees  marketing requirements and information systems 
ongoing infrastructure investment also may be required to support realized growth  including expenditures with respect to upgraded and expanded information systems and enhancing our management team 
sales our revenues are primarily derived from the sale of juvenile health  safety and wellness products and are recognized upon transfer of title of product to our customers 
our products are marketed through several distribution channels including chain retailers  specialty retailers and on line retailers 
a number of large  north american retail customers account for a majority of our sales 
three customers generated more than of sales for the year ended december   toys r us  walmart  and target 
because of the concentration of our business with these customers and because we have no long term contracts with these customers  our success depends on our customers willingness to purchase and provide shelf space for our products 
over of sales are currently made to customers in north america  with the remaining sales primarily made to customers in the united kingdom 
sales are made utilizing standard credit terms of to days 
we generally accept returns only for defective merchandise 
cost of goods sold and other expenses our products are manufactured by third parties  with approximately of the dollar value of products being manufactured in asia with the majority of the balance being manufactured in the united states and israel 
cost of goods sold primarily represents purchases of finished products from these third party manufacturers 
the remainder of our cost of goods sold includes duties on certain imported items  freight in from suppliers and miscellaneous charges from contract manufacturers 
substantially all of our purchases are made in us dollars  therefore  most of this activity is not subject to currency fluctuations 
if our suppliers experience increased raw materials  labor or other costs and pass along those cost increases through higher prices for finished goods  our cost of sales would increase  and to the extent we are unable to pass these price increases along to our customers  our gross margins would decrease 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of payroll  insurance  professional fees  royalties  freight out to customers  product development costs  advertising and marketing expenses including co op advertising allowances as negotiated with certain customers and sales commissions 
several of these items fluctuate with sales  some of these variable costs are based on sales to particular customers and others are based on sales of particular products 
there are no significant variations in seasonal demand for our products 
sales to our retail customers are generally higher in the time frame when retailers take initial shipments of new products 
these orders usually incorporate enough product to fill each store plus additional amounts to be kept at the customer s distribution center 
the timing of these initial shipments varies by customer 
table of contents depending on when they finalize store layouts for the upcoming year  and whether there are any mid year product introductions 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates this summary of our critical accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of our management  which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity 
these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our financial statements 
some of these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates were made 
however  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
revenue recognition we record revenue when all of the following occur persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred  the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
sales are recorded net of provisions for returns and allowances  cash discounts and markdowns 
we base our estimates for discounts  returns and allowances on negotiated customer terms  and historical experience 
these estimates are subject to variability  as actual deductions taken by customers may be different from the estimates recorded 
customers do not have the right to return products unless the products are defective 
we record a reduction of sales for estimated future defective product deductions based on historical experience 
sales incentives or other consideration given by us to customers that are considered adjustments of the selling price of its products  such as markdowns  are reflected as reductions of revenue 
sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received  such as the appearance of our products in a customer s national circular ad  are reflected as selling and marketing expenses in the accompanying statements of income 
trade receivables trade receivables are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts 
on a periodic basis  we estimate doubtful accounts based on historical bad debt  factors related to specific customers ability to pay and current economic trends 
we write off accounts receivable against the allowance when a balance is determined to be uncollectible 
we do not accrue interest on trade receivables 
a receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within the credit terms on the account  typically days for most customers 
we will turn an account over for collection around days past due 
accounts are considered uncollectible if no payments are received to days after they have been turned over for collection 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts represents adjustments to customer trade accounts receivable for amounts deemed uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reduces gross trade receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the allowance is based on our assessment of the business environment  customers financial condition  historical trends  customer payment practices  receivable 
table of contents aging and customer disputes 
we will continue to proactively review our credit risks and adjust customer terms to reflect the current environment 
inventory valuation inventory is comprised of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost  inclusive of freight and duty  or market net realizable value using the first in  first out fifo method 
our warehousing costs are charged to expense as incurred 
we regularly review slow moving and excess inventory  and write down inventories as appropriate 
management uses estimates to record write downs based on its review of inventory by product category  including length of time on hand and estimates of future orders for each product 
changes in consumer preferences  as well as demand for products  customer buying patterns and inventory management could impact the inventory valuation 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered to be impaired when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
long lived assets include property and equipment 
the amount of impairment loss  if any  is charged by the company to current operations 
for each of the years ended december  and  no such impairment existed 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with accounting guidance that requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives and not subject to amortization be tested at least annually for impairment 
we evaluate goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying value  including goodwill  to the company s fair value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
under this second step  the implied goodwill value is determined  in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  to assess the level of goodwill impairment  if any 
we determine the company s fair value using the income  or discounted cash flows  approach 
dcf model and verify the reasonableness of such fair value calculations using the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows 
these assumptions include projections of future revenue  costs and working capital changes 
in addition  we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables  as required  in estimating fair value 
the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions 
the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions  and changes in our business strategy  government regulations  or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments 
we will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods 
as of december   the estimated fair value of the company exceeded the carrying value of our reporting unit 
management evaluates the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that is not being amortized each reporting period to determine whether evens and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if an intangible asset that is not being amortized is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life  it is amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method of accounting 
under the asset and liability method  a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
the measurement of deferred income tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance  if necessary  to recognize future tax benefits only to the extent  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized 
previously  the company adopted the provisions of a new standard which provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in the financial statements 
tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon adoption and in subsequent periods 
upon the adoption  and at december  and  the company did not have any uncertain tax positions 
no interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were accrued at december  and the tax years through remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the company s federal tax return for the year ended december  is currently being audited by the internal revenue service 
the company expects no material changes to unrecognized tax positions within the next twelve months 
results of operations the following table presents selected condensed consolidated financial information for summer infant  inc and its subsidiaries for the years ended december  and year ended december  year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit sg a expenses interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization net income year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales increased from  in the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to organic growth resulting from increased distribution of existing products throughout our customer base  introduction of new products and international growth 
in addition  the company acquired born free holdings  ltd 
in march  which added approximately  to net sales in while net sales increased in  sales were impacted by lower than expected consumer purchases of our new prodigy car seat and travel system  reduced inventory levels at retail customers and delays in shipping of certain new products 
gross profit increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales 
gross profit percentage decreased to of sales for the year ended december  from in the prior year due to increased costs of raw materials and labor  plus a change in sales mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily 
table of contents attributable to increased variable costs such as co op advertising allowances as a result of the significant increase in sales 
in addition  there were increased expenditures in product development  payroll  professional fees  and warehouse operations 
finally  there were several significant items incurred during including professional fees and transition costs related to the born free acquisition  related to the proposed settlement of outstanding litigation  related to the closure and relocation of our rhode island distribution center and of severance for three former senior management employees 
other expenses increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to an increase in depreciation and amortization in and higher interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources we generally fund our operations and working capital needs through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
our sales have increased significantly over the past several years 
this sales growth has led to a substantial increase in working capital requirements  specifically accounts receivable and inventory 
the typical cash flow cycle is as follows inventory is purchased to meet expected demand plus a safety stock 
because the majority of our vendors are based in asia  inventory takes from three to four weeks to arrive from asia to the various distribution points we maintain in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
payment terms for these vendors are approximately days from the date the product ships from asia  therefore we are generally paying for the product a short time after it is physically received in the united states 
the increased sales we have experienced result in increased levels of inventory and  therefore  an increase in the amount of cash required to fund our inventory level 
sales to customers generally have payment terms of days 
the increased sales have resulted in an increase in the level of accounts receivable  and therefore have increased the amount of cash required to fund working capital 
we have traditionally been able to fund our increased working capital through lines of credit with banks 
the majority of capital expenditures are for tools related to new product introductions 
we receive indications from retailers generally around the middle of each year as to what products the retailer will be taking into its product line for the upcoming year 
based on these indications  we will then acquire the tools required to build the products 
in most cases the payments for the tools are spread out over a three to four month period 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities totaled  which primarily relates to improved working capital management 
at december   net cash used in operating activities totaled  the change in net cash relating to operating activities in as compared to is largely attributable to decreases in accounts payable and accounts receivable in for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was approximately  which primarily relates to capital expenditures and the born free acquisition 
at december   net cash used in investing activities was  the increase in net cash used in investing activities in was due primarily to the born free acquisition 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  which relates to borrowings from our debt facilities to fund the born free acquisition and 
table of contents working capital growth 
at december   net cash provided by financing activities was  the decrease in in net cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to lower borrowings 
based primarily on the above factors  the net cash increase for the year ended december  was approximately  resulting in a cash balance of approximately  at december  we believe that our cash on hand and current banking facilities are sufficient to fund our cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  unforeseen circumstances  such as softness in the retail industry or deterioration in the business of a significant customer could create a situation where we cannot access all of the available lines of credit due to not having sufficient assets or consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement described below as required under our loan agreements 
there is no assurance that we will meet all of our bank covenants in the future  or that our lender will grant waivers if there are covenant violations 
in addition  should we need to raise additional funds through additional debt or equity financings  any sale of additional debt or equity securities may cause dilution to existing stockholders 
if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to address any unexpected changes in our operations could be limited 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds if and when they are required 
failure to obtain future funding when needed or on acceptable terms could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
our strategy for funding our business going forward is a combination of increased profitability  and if necessary  negotiation of increased borrowing lines as required with traditional lenders 
in august  we entered into a secured credit agreement with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  and each of the financial institutions that is a signatory to the agreement 
the agreement was amended on march  and on november  as amended  the loan agreement 
the loan agreement provides for an  working capital revolving credit facility and a  accordion credit facility 
the loan matures on june  summer and its subsidiaries  summer infant usa  inc  summer infant europe limited  summer infant asia limited and summer infant canada  limited are the borrowers under the loan agreement 
this loan agreement replaced summer s prior line of credit and is being used principally to fund growth opportunities and for working capital purposes 
our ability to borrow under the loan agreement is subject to its ongoing compliance with a number of financial and other covenants  including the following i that summer and its subsidiaries maintain consolidated ebitda  as defined in the loan agreement  of at least  on a trailing twelve month basis as of december   which escalates to  by the end of the loan term in  ii that summer and its subsidiaries maintain a ratio of total funded debt to consolidated ebitda of not greater than  and iii that summer and its subsidiaries maintain a ratio of operating cash flow to debt service of not less than 
upon utilizing all approved and permitted add backs  as defined in the loan agreement  the company is in compliance with these and other covenants at december  these credit facilities bear interest at a floating rate based on a spread over libor ranging from basis points to basis points  depending upon the ratio of the company s total funded debt to consolidated ebitda 
the company has also entered into various interest swap agreements which fixes the interest rates on a portion of the outstanding debt 
only one of these swaps remains active at december  as of december   the rate on these credit facilities averaged 
in addition  these credit facilities have an unused line fee based on the unused amount of the credit facilities equal to basis points 

table of contents the loan agreement also contains customary events of default  including a cross default provision and a change of control provision 
in the event of a default  all of the obligations of the company and its subsidiaries under the loan agreement may be declared immediately due and payable 
for certain events of default relating to insolvency and receivership  all outstanding obligations become due and payable
