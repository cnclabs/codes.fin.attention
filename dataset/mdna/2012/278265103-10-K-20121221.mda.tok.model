item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our principal business is managing investment funds and providing investment management and advisory services to high net worth individuals and institutions 
our core strategy is to develop and sustain management expertise across a range of investment disciplines and to offer leading investment products and services through multiple distribution channels 
in executing this strategy  we have developed broadly diversified investment management capabilities and a powerful marketing  distribution and customer service organization 
although we manage and distribute a wide range of investment products and services  we operate in one business segment  namely as an investment adviser to funds and separate accounts 
we are a market leader in a number of investment areas  including tax managed equity  value equity  equity income  structured emerging market equity  floating rate bank loan  municipal bond  investment grade  global and high yield bond investing 
our breadth of investment management capabilities supports a wide range of products and services offered to fund shareholders  retail managed account investors  institutional investors and high net worth clients 
our equity strategies encompass a diversity of investment objectives  risk profiles  income levels and geographic representation 
our income investment strategies cover a broad duration and credit quality range and encompass both taxable and tax free investments 
we also offer a range of alternative investment strategies  including commodity based investments and a spectrum of absolute return strategies 
as of october   we had billion in assets under management 
our principal retail marketing strategy is to distribute funds and separately managed accounts through financial intermediaries in the advice channel 
we have a broad reach in this marketplace  with distribution partners including national and regional broker dealers  independent broker dealers  independent financial advisory firms  banks and insurance companies 
we support these distribution partners with a team of approximately sales professionals covering us and international markets 
we also commit significant resources to serving institutional and high net worth clients who access investment management services on a direct basis 
through our wholly owned affiliates and consolidated subsidiaries we manage investments for a broad range of clients in the institutional and high net worth marketplace  including corporations  endowments  foundations  family offices and public and private employee retirement plans 
our revenue is derived primarily from investment advisory  administrative  distribution and service fees received from eaton vance funds and investment advisory fees received from separate accounts 
our fees are based primarily on the value of the investment portfolios we manage and fluctuate with changes in the total value and mix of assets under management 
such fees are recognized over the period that we manage these assets 
our major expenses are employee compensation  distribution related expenses  facilities expense and information technology expense 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  investments and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
market developments prevailing market conditions affect our managed asset levels  operating results and the recoverability of our investments 
fiscal was a period of generally favorable market action  as reflected by the percent increase in the s p index 
managed asset levels average assets under management of billion in fiscal were substantially unchanged from billion in fiscal while net outflows from funds and separate accounts with eaton vance large cap value mandates offset net inflows into other long term strategies in fiscal  we ended the year with positive net inflows 
we continue to see modestly lower total effective fee rates due to a decline in distribution and service fee related revenue  reflecting lower managed assets in fund share classes that are subject to those fees 
consistent with industry trends  our fund business continues to evolve from class b and class c shares  with distribution and service fees generally totaling basis points on average daily assets  to class i shares  with no distribution or service fees  and class a shares  with distribution and service fees generally totaling basis points of average daily assets 
although this share class trend has an adverse effect on our total effective fee rate  the net income impact is smaller due to offsetting declines in distribution  service and deferred sales commission amortization expense 
as a matter of course  investors in our sponsored open end funds and separate accounts have the ability to redeem their shares or investments at any time  without prior notice  and there are no material restrictions that would prevent such investors from doing so 
operating results in fiscal  our revenue decreased percent from fiscal  reflecting substantially unchanged average assets under management and a modest decline in our total effective fee rate 
our operating expenses decreased percent in fiscal  partly reflecting decreases in expenses tied to asset levels that decrease as assets under management decrease  such as certain distribution and service fees  and decreases in our sales related expenses  which vary with the level of sales and the acquisition costs of new assets 
assets under management assets under management of billion on october  were percent higher than the billion reported a year earlier 
assets under management on october  included billion in long term funds  billion in institutional separate accounts  billion in high net worth separate accounts  billion in retail managed accounts and billion in cash management fund assets 
long term fund net outflows of billion during the twelve month period ended october  reflect gross inflows of billion offset by outflows of billion 
long term fund net outflows include net reductions in fund leverage of billion 
institutional separate account net inflows were billion  high net worth separate account net inflows were billion and retail managed account net inflows were billion during the twelve month period ended october  market price appreciation increased managed assets by billion during the twelve month period ended october   while a decrease in cash management assets reduced assets under management by billion 
we report managed assets and flow data by investment mandate 
the alternative category includes a range of absolute return strategies  as well as commodity and currency linked investments

approximately million of the total million consolidated clo entity net income was included in net income attributable to non controlling and other beneficial interests  reflecting third party note holders proportionate interests in the net income of the entity 
the remaining million in fiscal was included in net income attributable to eaton vance corp 
shareholders  representing the company s proportionate interest in the net income of the entity and management fees earned 
net loss of our consolidated clo entity totaled million in fiscal  representing million of other loss and million of other operating expenses 
approximately million of the total million consolidated clo entity net loss was included in net income attributable to non controlling and other beneficial interests  reflecting third party note holders proportionate interests in the net loss of the entity 
the remaining million in fiscal was included in net income attributable to eaton vance corp 
shareholders  representing the company s proportionate interest in the net income of the entity and management fees earned 
income taxes our effective tax rate  calculated as income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes and equity in net income of affiliates  was percent  percent and percent in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in our overall effective tax rate in fiscal can be primarily attributed to the higher consolidated clo entity income allocated to other beneficial interest holders and therefore not subject to tax in the calculation of the company s tax provision 
the increase in our overall effective tax rate in fiscal can be primarily attributed to the losses incurred by the company s consolidated clo entity  which are substantially borne by other beneficial interest holders and therefore not included in the calculation of the company s income taxes 
excluding the effect of the consolidated clo entity income and loss allocated to other beneficial interest holders  our effective tax rate would have been percent and percent in fiscal and  respectively 
our policy for accounting for income taxes includes monitoring our business activities and tax policies for compliance with federal  state and foreign tax laws 
in the ordinary course of business  various taxing authorities may not agree with certain tax positions we have taken  or applicable law may not be clear 
we periodically review these tax positions and provide for and adjust as necessary estimated liabilities relating to such positions as part of our overall tax provision 
there were no significant changes in our estimates surrounding these positions in either of the periods presented 
equity in net income of affiliates  net of tax equity in net income of affiliates  net of tax  for fiscal primarily reflects our percent equity interest in hexavest acquired on august   our percent minority equity interest in a private equity partnership and equity interests in certain funds we sponsor or manage  notably eaton vance richard bernstein all asset strategy fund  eaton vance real estate fund  agf floating rate income fund  eaton vance tax advantaged bond strategies long term fund and eaton vance parametric structured currency fund 
equity in net income of affiliates  net of tax  increased by million in fiscal  primarily due to the inclusion of our percent equity interest in hexavest  offset by a decrease in the net income of the private equity partnership 
equity in net income of affiliates  net of tax  increased by million in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in the net income of the private equity partnership 
as noted above  we sold our equity investment in lloyd george management in fiscal net income attributable to non controlling and other beneficial interests net income attributable to non controlling and other beneficial interests increased by million in fiscal  reflecting an increase of million in gains attributable to other beneficial interest holders of the consolidated clo entity and a million increase in net income attributable to non controlling interest holders in the company s consolidated funds and majority owned subsidiaries offset by a million decrease in positive adjustments to the estimated redemption value of non controlling interests in those subsidiaries 
in fiscal  the adjustments made to the estimated redemption value of non controlling interests in parametric  parametric risk advisors and atlanta capital were million  million and million respectively 
in fiscal  the adjustments made to the estimated redemption value of non controlling interests in parametric  parametric risk advisors and atlanta capital were million  million and million  respectively 
net income attributable to non controlling and other beneficial interests decreased by million in fiscal  reflecting the recognition of million of losses borne by other beneficial interest holders of the consolidated clo entity partly offset by an million increase in net income attributable to non controlling interest holders in the company s consolidated funds and majority owned subsidiaries and an million increase in valuation adjustments made to the estimated redemption value of non controlling interests in those subsidiaries 
the increase in valuation adjustments made to the estimated redemption values of non controlling interests in majority owned subsidiaries reflects the subsidiaries profit growth 
net income attributable to non controlling and other beneficial interests is not adjusted for taxes due to the underlying tax status of our consolidated subsidiaries 
parametric  parametric risk advisors and atlanta capital are limited liability companies that are treated as partnerships for tax purposes 
funds and the clo entity we consolidate are registered investment companies or private funds that are treated as pass through entities for tax purposes 
changes in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the assets and liabilities of our consolidated clo entity do not affect our liquidity or capital resources 
the collateral assets of our consolidated clo entity are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clo entity and we have no right to these assets beyond our direct investment in and management fees generated from the entity  both of which are eliminated in consolidation 
the note holders of the clo entity have no recourse to the general credit of the company 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of our consolidated clo entity are excluded from the discussion of liquidity and capital resources below 
the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity  capital resources and uses of cash on october   and and for the years then ended balance sheet and cash flow data october  in thousands balance sheet data assets cash and cash equivalents    investment advisory fees and other receivables  total liquid assets    investments    liabilities debt    years ended october  in thousands cash flow data operating cash flows    investing cash flows    financing cash flows    liquidity and capital resources liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and investment advisory fees and other receivables 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short term  highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash 
investment advisory fees and other receivables primarily represent receivables due from sponsored funds and separately managed accounts for investment advisory and distribution services provided 
liquid assets represented percent and percent of total assets on october  and  respectively  excluding those assets identified as assets of the consolidated clo entity 
the company s seed investments in consolidated funds and separate accounts are not treated as liquid assets because they may be longer term in nature 
the million decrease in liquid assets in fiscal primarily reflects net cash provided by operating activities of million  net inflows into consolidated funds from non controlling interest holders of million  proceeds from the issuance of non voting common stock of million  million of excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and million reflecting the impact of our consolidated clo entity s operating  investing and financing activities  offset by net cash used for the purchase of available for sale securities and investments in equity method investees of million  the repurchase of million of non voting common stock  the payment of million of dividends to shareholders  million in contingent payments made to the sellers of the former tax advantaged bond strategies tabs business of md sass investors services and the payment of million to acquire additional interests in our majority owned subsidiaries 
net cash used for the purchase of available for sale securities and investments in equity method investees of million primarily reflects our acquisition of a percent interest in hexavest in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in investment advisory fees and other receivables can be attributed to the increase in our revenue run rate at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal the million increase in liquid assets in fiscal can be attributed to an increase in cash and cash equivalent balances of million and an increase in investment advisory fees and other receivables of million 
the increase in cash and cash equivalent balances in fiscal primarily reflects net cash provided by operating activities of million  net proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of million  net inflows into consolidated funds from non controlling interest holders of million and proceeds from the issuance of non voting common stock of million offset by the repurchase of million of non voting common stock  the payment of million of dividends to shareholders  million in contingent payments made to the sellers of tabs business and the payment of million to purchase additional interests in parametric and parametric risk advisors in the third quarter of fiscal the increase in investment advisory fees and other receivables can be attributed to the increase in our revenue run rate at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal on october   our debt consisted of million in aggregate principal amount of percent ten year unsecured notes due in we also maintain a million unsecured revolving credit facility with several banks that expires on june  the facility provides that we may borrow at libor based rates of interest that vary depending on the level of usage of the facility and our credit ratings 
the agreement contains financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage and requires us to pay an annual commitment fee on any unused portion 
we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility at october  or at any point during the fiscal year 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of october  we continue to monitor our liquidity daily 
we remain committed to growing our business and expect that our main uses of cash will be to invest in new products  acquire shares of our non voting common stock  pay dividends  make strategic acquisitions  enhance technology infrastructure and pay the operating expenses of the business  which are largely variable in nature and fluctuate with revenue and assets under management 
we believe that our existing liquid assets  cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility are sufficient to meet our current and forecasted operating cash needs and to satisfy our future commitments as more fully described in contractual obligations below 
the risk exists  however  that if we determine we need to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt in the future  resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
our ability to enter the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors  including the state of global credit and equity markets  interest rates  credit spreads and our credit ratings 
if we are unable to access capital markets to issue new debt  refinance existing debt or sell shares of our non voting common stock as needed  or if we are unable to obtain such financing on acceptable terms  our business could be adversely impacted 
recoverability of our investments our million of investments as of october  consisted of our percent equity interest in hexavest and positions in eaton vance managed funds and separate accounts entered into for investment and business development purposes 
investments in sponsored products are generally in liquid debt or equity securities and are carried at fair market value 
we test our investments  excluding our equity method investments but including our investments in non consolidated clo entities and investments classified as available for sale  for impairment on a quarterly basis 
we evaluate our investments in non consolidated clo entities and investments classified as available for sale for impairment using quantitative factors  including how long the investment has been in a net unrealized loss position  and qualitative factors  including the underlying credit quality of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment 
if markets deteriorate during the quarters ahead  our assessment of impairment on a quantitative basis may lead us to impair investments in future quarters that were in an unrealized loss position at october  we test our investments in equity method investees  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or as facts and circumstances indicate that additional analysis is warranted 
there have been no significant changes in financial condition in fiscal that would indicate that an impairment loss exists at october  we periodically review our deferred sales commissions and identifiable intangible assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
there have been no significant changes in financial condition in fiscal that would indicate that an impairment loss exists at october  operating cash flows our operating cash flows are calculated by adjusting net income to reflect other significant sources and uses of cash  certain significant non cash items and timing differences in the cash settlement of other assets and liabilities 
significant sources and uses of cash that are not reflected in either revenue or operating expenses include net cash flows associated with our deferred sales commission assets capitalized sales commissions paid net of contingent deferred sales charges received as well as net cash flows associated with the purchase and sale of investments within the portfolios of our consolidated funds and separate accounts proceeds received from the sale of trading investments net of cash outflows associated with the purchase of trading investments 
significant non cash items include the amortization of deferred sales commissions and intangible assets  depreciation  stock based compensation and the net change in deferred income taxes 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million from the million reported in fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operating activities year over year  primarily reflects a net increase in operating cash flows related to timing differences in the cash settlement of other assets and liabilities partially offset by net gains recognized by our consolidated clo entity compared to net losses in fiscal and an increase in our net deferred income tax asset 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million from the million reported in fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operating activities year over year primarily reflects an increase in net income attributable to eaton vance corp 
shareholders of million  the receipt of a federal income tax refund of million in fiscal associated with the change in tax accounting for certain closed end fund distribution expenses and a net decrease of million related to timing differences in the cash settlement of other assets and liabilities 
investing cash flows cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements  cash paid in acquisitions  the purchase and sale of available for sale investments in sponsored funds that we do not consolidate and equity method investments 
cash used for investing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by investing activities year over year can be primarily attributed to our acquisition of a percent equity interest in hexavest  which is included in purchase of investments 
in fiscal and  the company made contingent payments of million and million  respectively  to the sellers of tabs under the terms of the acquisition agreement 
cash provided by investing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to cash used for investing activities of million in fiscal the increase in cash provided by investing activities year over year can be primarily attributed to an increase in net proceeds received in conjunction with the net purchases and sales of available for sale investments in fiscal in fiscal  the company made a contingent payment of million  to the sellers of tabs under the terms of the acquisition agreement 
financing cash flows financing cash flows primarily reflect distributions to non controlling interest holders of our majority owned subsidiaries and consolidated funds  the purchase of additional non controlling interests in our majority owned subsidiaries  the issuance and repurchase of our non voting common stock  excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and the payment of dividends to our shareholders 
financing cash flows also include proceeds from the issuance of capital stock by consolidated investment companies net of cash paid to meet redemptions by non controlling interest holders of these funds 
cash used for financing activities totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we paid million to acquire additional interests in our majority owned subsidiaries  repurchased and retired approximately million shares of our non voting common stock for million under our authorized repurchase programs and issued million shares of our non voting common stock in connection with the grant of restricted share awards  the exercise of stock options and other employee stock purchases for total proceeds of million 
we have authorization to purchase an additional million shares as of october  under our current share repurchase authorization and anticipate that future repurchases will continue to be an ongoing use of cash 
our dividends declared per share were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal we currently expect to declare and pay comparable dividends on our voting and non voting common stock on a quarterly basis 
on december   the company declared a special dividend of per share on its voting and non voting common stock payable on december  contractual obligations the following table details our future contractual obligations as of october  payments due by period less than after in millions total year years years years operating leases facilities and equipment senior notes interest payment on senior notes investment in private equity partnership unrecognized tax benefits total  contractual obligations of consolidated clo senior and subordinated note obligations interest payments on senior notes total contractual obligations of consolidated clo minimum payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of million to be received in the future under noncancelable subleases 
this amount includes unrecognized tax benefits along with accrued interest and penalties 
in july  we committed to invest up to million in a private equity partnership that invests in companies in the financial services industry 
we had invested million of the maximum million as of october  the remaining commitment is included in the table above 
interests held by non controlling interest holders of atlanta capital  parametric and parametric risk advisers are not subject to mandatory redemption 
the purchase of non controlling interests is predicated  for each subsidiary  on the exercise of a series of puts held by non controlling interest holders and calls held by us 
neither the exercise of the puts nor the exercise of the calls is contingent upon the non controlling interest holders of the acquired entities remaining employed by the company 
the puts provide the non controlling interest holders the right to require us to purchase these retained interests at specific intervals over time  while the calls provide us with the right to require the non controlling interest holders to sell their retained equity interests to us at specified intervals over time  as well as upon the occurrence of certain events such as death or permanent disability 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to the timing of any non controlling interest purchase in the future 
the value assigned to the purchase of an originating non controlling interest is based  in each case  on a multiple of earnings before interest and taxes of the subsidiary  which is a measure that is intended to represent fair market value 
there is no discrete floor or ceiling on any non controlling interest purchase 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to the amount of any non controlling interest purchase in the future 
accordingly  future payments to be made to purchase non controlling interests have been excluded from the above table  unless a put or call option has been exercised and a mandatory firm commitment exists for us to purchase such non controlling interests 
although the timing and amounts of these purchases cannot be predicted with certainty  we anticipate that the purchase of non controlling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries may be a significant use of cash in future years 
we have presented all redeemable non controlling interests at redemption value on our consolidated balance sheet as of october  we have recorded the current year change in the estimated redemption value of non controlling interests redeemable at fair value as a component of additional paid in capital and have recorded the current year change in the estimated redemption value of non controlling interests redeemable at other than fair value as a component of net income attributable to non controlling and other beneficial interests 
based on our calculations  the estimated redemption value of our non controlling interests  redeemable at either fair value or other than fair value  totaled million on october  compared to million on october  redeemable non controlling interests as of october  consist of third party investors ownership in consolidated investment funds of million  non controlling interests in parametric  parametric risk advisors and atlanta capital redeemable at other than fair value of million  million and million  respectively  and redeemable interests in profit interests granted under subsidiary specific long term incentive plans of parametric and atlanta capital of million and million  respectively 
redeemable non controlling interests as of october  consist of third party investors ownership in consolidated investment funds of million  non controlling interests in parametric  parametric risk advisors and atlanta capital redeemable at other than fair value of million  million and million  respectively  and redeemable interests in profit interests of parametric and atlanta capital of million and million  respectively 
in conjunction with its acquisition of the tabs business in december  the company is obligated to make four further annual contingent payments based on prescribed multiples of tabs s revenue for the twelve months ending december    and there is no defined floor or ceiling on any payment  resulting in significant uncertainty as to the amount of any payment in the future 
accordingly  future payments to be made have been excluded from the above table until such time as the uncertainty has been resolved 
the company made a contingent payment of million with respect to the twelve months ended december  in april  the non controlling interest holders of parametric exercised a put option requiring the company to purchase an additional interest in parametric for million  representing a percent capital interest and a percent profit interest in the entity 
the transaction increased our ownership interest from percent to percent when the payment was made in may 
the payment was treated as an equity transaction and reduced redeemable non controlling interests at closing 
the transaction reduced capital interests held by non controlling interest holders from percent on october  to percent on october  profit interests held by non controlling interest holders  which include direct profit interests in parametric as well as indirect profit interests granted as part of a long term equity incentive plan of that entity  decreased to percent on october  from percent on october   reflecting a percent profit interest granted under the long term equity plan offset by the re purchase of the percent profit interest referenced above 
in june  parametric exercised a call option requiring the non controlling interest holders of parametric risk advisors to sell an additional interest in parametric risk advisors for million 
the transaction increased parametric s ownership interest from percent to percent when the payment was made in july 
the payment was treated as an equity transaction and reduced redeemable non controlling interests at closing 
capital interests held by non controlling interest holders of atlanta capital totaled percent on october  and profit interests held by non controlling interest holders  which include direct profit interests in atlanta capital as well as indirect profit interests granted as part of a long term equity incentive plan of that entity  increased to percent on october  from percent on october   reflecting an additional percent profit interest granted under the long term equity plan 
on august   we completed the purchase of a percent equity interest in hexavest  a montreal based investment advisor that provides discretionary management of equity and tactical asset allocation strategies using a predominantly top down investment style 
following the closing  the employee shareholders of hexavest continue to control and direct its operations and the company assumed primary responsibility for hexavest s new business development outside of canada 
at closing we paid million to acquire the percent interest  sourced from cash on hand 
the company will be obligated to make additional payments in respect of the acquired interest in fiscal and if hexavest exceeds defined annual revenue thresholds in the first and second twelve month periods following the closing  respectively 
we have the option to acquire an additional percent interest in hexavest in there is no defined floor or ceiling on any payment  resulting in significant uncertainty as to the amount of any payment in the future 
accordingly  future payments to be made have been excluded from the above table until such time as the uncertainty has been resolved 
although the amounts of these payments cannot be predicted with certainty  we anticipate they may be a significant use of cash in future years 
on november   parametric announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the business of the clifton group investment management company clifton group 
based in minneapolis  clifton group specializes in providing futures and options based overlay services and custom risk management solutions to institutional investors 
following the closing  clifton group will be organized as a division of parametric operating under its current leadership 
parametric will acquire the clifton group business using a loan from the company  sourced from cash on hand 
completion of the transaction is expected on or about december  and is subject to certain customary closing conditions 
no amounts relating to this purchase have been included in the table above 
foreign subsidiaries we consider the undistributed earnings of our canadian subsidiary as of october  to be indefinitely re invested 
accordingly  no us income taxes have been provided thereon 
as of october   the company had approximately million of undistributed earnings in our canadian subsidiary that is not available to fund domestic operations or to distribute to shareholders unless repatriated 
the company would need to accrue and pay us corporate income taxes if such funds were repatriated 
the company s current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not invest in any off balance sheet vehicles that provide financing  liquidity  market or credit risk support or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
consolidation of variable interest entities effective november   we adopted new accounting guidance relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
this accounting guidance provides a framework for determining whether an entity should be considered a vie and  if so  whether our involvement with the entity results in a variable interest in the entity 
if we determine that we do have a variable interest in the entity  we must then perform an analysis to determine whether it represents the primary beneficiary of the vie 
if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie  we are required to consolidate the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vie into the consolidated financial statements of the company 
a company is the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has a controlling financial interest in the vie 
a company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie if it has both i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and ii the obligation to absorb the losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
our evaluation of whether we qualify as the primary beneficiary of a vie is highly complex 
in our analysis  we must make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows of the vie 
these estimates and assumptions relate primarily to market interest rates  credit default rates  pre payment rates  discount rates  the marketability of certain securities and the probability of certain outcomes 
there is also judgment involved in assessing whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the entity 
while we believe that our evaluation is appropriate  future changes in estimates  judgments and assumptions in the case of an evaluation triggered by a reconsideration event as defined in the accounting standard may affect the determination of the primary beneficiary status and the resulting consolidation  or deconsolidation  of the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vie in our consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques to measure fair value 
this fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories based on the nature of the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  an investment s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
level unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date 
level observable inputs other than level unadjusted quoted market prices  such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active  and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or corroborated by observable market data 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in the net assets of acquired companies over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition 
we attribute all goodwill associated with the acquisitions of atlanta capital and parametric  which share similar economic characteristics  to a single reporting unit 
management believes that the inclusion of these entities in a single reporting unit for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing most accurately reflects the synergies achieved in acquiring these entities  namely centralized distribution of similar products and services to similar clients 
we attribute all goodwill associated with the acquisition of tabs and fox asset management to a second reporting unit 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to the carrying amounts  including goodwill 
we establish fair value for the purpose of impairment testing by either using the income approach or by averaging fair value established using an income approach and fair value established using a market approach  depending on the reporting unit 
the income approach employs a discounted cash flow model that takes into account assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value  current period actual results  and budgeted results for future periods that have been vetted by senior management at the reporting unit level 
budgeted results for future periods are most significantly impacted by assumptions made as to the growth in assets under management  future revenue run rates and future operating margins 
the discounted cash flow model incorporates the same fundamental pricing concepts used to calculate fair value in the acquisition due diligence process and a discount rate that takes into consideration our estimated cost of capital adjusted for the uncertainty inherent in the acquisition 
the market approach employs market multiples for comparable transactions in the financial services industry obtained from industry sources  taking into consideration the nature  scope and size of the acquired reporting unit 
estimates of fair value are established using a multiple of assets under management and current and forward multiples of both revenue and ebitda adjusted for size and performance level relative to peer companies 
a weighted average calculation is then performed  giving greater weight to fair value calculated based on multiples of revenue and ebitda and lesser weight to fair value calculated as a multiple of assets under management 
fair values calculated using one year  two year and trailing twelve month revenue multiples and one year  two year and trailing twelve month ebitda multiples are each weighted percent  while fair value calculated based on a multiple of assets under management is weighted percent 
we believe that fair value calculated based on multiples of revenue and ebitda is a better indicator of fair value in that these fair values provide information as to both scale and profitability 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its calculated fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
intangible assets amortized identifiable intangible assets generally represent the cost of client relationships and management contracts acquired 
in valuing these assets  we make assumptions regarding useful lives and projected growth rates  and significant judgment is required 
we periodically review identifiable intangibles for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amounts of the assets exceed their respective fair values  additional impairment tests are performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
non amortizing intangible assets generally represent the cost of mutual fund management contracts acquired 
non amortizing intangible assets are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the management contracts acquired to their carrying values 
the company establishes fair value for purposes of impairment testing using the income approach 
if the carrying value of a management contract acquired exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
accounting for income taxes our effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates of the many jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
in the ordinary course of business  many transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  and we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that actual outcomes will likely be different from our estimates 
accounting standards require that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
the more likely than not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit 
unrecognized tax benefits  as well as the related interest  are adjusted regularly to reflect changing facts and circumstances 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning in assessing our taxes  changes in tax laws may result in a change to our tax position and effective tax rate 
we classify any interest or penalties incurred as a component of income tax expense 
management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and to make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets 
we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
this assessment takes into account our forecast of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods  our experience with the tax attributes expiring unused  tax planning alternatives and other tax considerations 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock based awards measured at grant date  is recognized over the relevant service period  and is adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions as to dividend yield  volatility  an appropriate risk free interest rate and the expected life of the option 
many of these assumptions require management s judgment but are not subject to significant variability 
management must also apply judgment in developing an expectation of awards that may be forfeited 
if actual experience differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
non controlling interests direct interests in our majority owned subsidiaries are puttable at established multiples of earnings before interest and taxes and  as such  are considered redeemable at other than fair value 
the company s non controlling interests redeemable at other than fair value are recorded in temporary equity at estimated redemption value and changes in estimated redemption value are recorded in earnings 
as a result  net income attributable to eaton vance corp 
shareholders and earnings per basic and diluted share are impacted by changes in the estimated redemption values of such redeemable non controlling interests 
accounting developments testing intangibles for impairment in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb updated the indefinite lived asset impairment testing guidance 
under the amended guidance  a reporting entity may elect to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the currently required quantitative fair value assessment 
the new guidance is effective for the company for the fiscal year that begins on november  the company is still in the process of determining whether or not it will make this election 
the adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
testing goodwill for impairment in september  the fasb issued an amendment to the existing goodwill impairment guidance 
the terms of the amendment permit a reporting entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform step one of the two step goodwill impairment test 
the new guidance is effective for the company for the fiscal year that begins on november  the company is still in the process of determining whether or not it will make this election 
the adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to different types of risk  including market risk 
market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity and bond prices  interest rates  credit risk or currency exchange rates 
management is responsible for identifying  assessing and managing market and other risks 
in evaluating market risk  it is important to note that most of our revenue is based on the market value of assets under management 
as noted in risk factors in item a  declines of financial market values negatively impact our revenue and net income 
our primary direct exposure to equity price risk arises from investments in equity securities made by consolidated sponsored funds  investments in equity securities held in separately managed accounts seeded for new product development purposes  our investments in sponsored equity funds that are not consolidated and our investments in equity method investees 
equity price risk as it relates to these investments represents the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the fund shares or underlying equity securities 
the following is a summary of the effect that a percent increase or decrease in equity prices would have on our investments subject to equity price fluctuation at october  in thousands carrying value carrying value assuming a increase carrying value assuming a decrease investment securities  trading equity securities  investment securities  available for sale sponsored funds  investment in equity method investees sponsored funds  total    currently we have a corporate hedging program in place to hedge currency risk and market price exposures on certain investments in consolidated sponsored funds and separately managed accounts seeded for new product development purposes 
as part of this program  we enter into futures and forward contracts to hedge exposure to certain equity instruments held within the portfolios of these separately managed accounts and consolidated sponsored funds 
the contracts negotiated are short term in nature 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes

our primary direct exposure to interest rate risk arises from our investment in fixed and floating rate income funds sponsored or managed by us  debt securities held by sponsored funds we consolidate and debt securities held in separately managed accounts seeded for new product development purposes 
we considered the negative effect on pre tax interest income of a basis point percent decline in interest rates as of october  a basis point decline in interest rates is a hypothetical scenario used to demonstrate potential risk and does not represent management s view of future market changes 
the following is a summary of the effect that a basis point decline in interest rates would have on our pre tax net income as of october in thousands carrying value pre tax interest income impact of a basis point decline in interest rates investment securities  trading debt securities  investment securities  available for sale sponsored funds  investments in equity method investees sponsored funds  total  from time to time  we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates associated with our debt financing 
in october  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of percent senior notes due in conjunction with the offering  we entered into an interest rate lock intended to hedge against adverse treasury rate movements between the time at which the decision was made to issue the debt and the pricing of the securities 
at the time the debt was issued  we terminated the lock and settled the transaction in cash 
at termination  the lock was determined to be a fully effective cash flow hedge and the million settlement cost was recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
there can be no assurance that our hedge instruments will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense or that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts on any future debt offerings 
our primary direct exposure to credit risk arises from our interest in a non consolidated cash instrument clo entity that is included in investments in our consolidated balance sheets as well as our interests in a consolidated clo entity that are eliminated in consolidation 
as an investor in a clo entity  we are entitled to only a residual interest in the clo entity  making these investments highly sensitive to the default and recovery experiences of the underlying instruments held by the clo entity 
our investments are subject to an impairment loss in the event that the cash flows generated by the collateral securities are not sufficient to allow equity holders to recover their investments 
if there is deterioration in the credit quality of collateral and reference securities and a corresponding increase in defaults  clo entity cash flows may be adversely impacted and we may be unable to recover our investment 
our total investment in interests in the non consolidated clo entity was valued at million  and our total investment in the consolidated clo entity was million  as of october   which represents our total value at risk with respect to such entities as of october  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk through our international operations 
while we operate primarily in the united states  and accordingly  most of our consolidated revenue and associated expenses are denominated in us dollars  we do provide services and earn revenue outside of the united states 
the portion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies may be impacted by movements in currency exchange rates 
the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk in our consolidated balance sheet relates primarily to an equity method investment and cash and cash equivalents that are denominated in foreign currencies  principally canadian dollars 
this risk will likely increase as our business outside of the united states grows 
we generally do not use derivative financial instruments to manage the foreign currency exchange risk exposure we assume in connection with investments in international operations 
as a result  both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar may affect our results of operations and accumulated other comprehensive income 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes
