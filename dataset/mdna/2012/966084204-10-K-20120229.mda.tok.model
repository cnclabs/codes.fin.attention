for more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information  you should read the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
overview of our company we are a fully integrated real estate company that owns and operates commercial properties in culturally diverse markets in major metropolitan areas 
founded in  we are internally managed with a portfolio of commercial properties in texas  arizona and illinois 
in october  our current management team joined the company and adopted a strategic plan to acquire  redevelop  own and operate community centered properties 
we define community centered properties as visibly located properties in established or developing culturally diverse neighborhoods in our target markets 
we market  lease  and manage our centers to match tenants with the shared needs of the surrounding neighborhood 
those needs may include specialty retail  grocery  restaurants and medical  educational and financial services 
our goal is for each property to become a whitestone branded business center or retail community that serves a neighboring five mile radius around our property 
we employ and develop a diverse group of associates who understand the needs of our multicultural communities and tenants 
as of december   we owned and operated commercial properties consisting of operating portfolio twenty one retail properties containing approximately million square feet of gross leasable area and having a total carrying amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  seven office properties containing approximately million square feet of gross leasable area and having a total carrying amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  and eleven office flex properties containing approximately million square feet of gross leasable area and having a total carrying amount net of accumulated depreciation of million 
redevelopment  new acquisitions portfolio four retail properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total carrying amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  and two parcels of land held for future development having a total carrying amount of million 
as of december   we had total tenants 
we have a diversified tenant base with our largest tenant comprising only of our total revenues for the year ended december  lease terms for our properties range from less than one year for smaller tenants to over years for larger tenants 
our leases generally include minimum monthly lease payments and tenant reimbursements for payment of taxes  insurance and maintenance 
we completed new and renewal leases during  totaling  square feet and million in total lease value 
on august   we amended to our declaration of trust to i change the name of all of our common shares of beneficial interest  par value to class a common shares  ii effect a for reverse share split of our class a common shares and iii change the par value of our class a common shares to per share after the reverse share split 
in addition  we created a new class of common shares of beneficial interest  par value  entitled class b common shares 
the class a and class b common shares are identical except that class b common shares are listed on the nyse amex  and class a common shares are not listed on a national securities exchange 
share and unit counts and per share and unit amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect our for reverse share split in august on august   in conjunction with the listing of our class b common shares on the nyse amex  we offered and subsequently issued million class b common shares which resulted in million in net offering proceeds to us 
on may   we completed a second public offering in which we issued million class b common shares for net offering proceeds of approximately million 
we used the proceeds from these offerings to acquire properties in our target markets and redevelop and re tenant our existing properties  as well as for general corporate purposes 

table of contents we employed full time employees as of december  as an internally managed reit  we bear our own expenses of operations  including the salaries  benefits and other compensation of our employees  office expenses  legal  accounting and investor relations expenses and other overhead costs 
how we derive our revenue substantially all of our revenue is derived from rents received from leases at our properties 
we had rental income and tenant reimbursements of approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the twelve months ended december  included  in increased revenues from new store operations 
we define new stores as properties acquired during the period being compared 
for the purposes of comparing the twelve months ended december  to the twelve months ended december   this includes properties acquired between january  and december  same store revenues increased  we define same stores as properties that were owned at the beginning of the period being compared 
for the purposes of comparing the twelve months ended december  to the twelve months ended december   this includes properties owned before january  same store average occupancy increased from for the twelve months ended december  to for the twelve months ended december   increasing same store revenue  the same store revenue rate per average leased square foot increased for the twelve months ended december  to per average leased square foot as compared to the twelve month ended december  revenue rate per average leased square foot of  increasing same store revenue known trends in our operations  outlook for future results rental income we expect our rental income to increase year over year due to the addition of properties 
the amount of net rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space  newly acquired properties with vacant space  and space available from unscheduled lease terminations 
the amount of rental income we generate also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates in our submarkets 
negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods  although we expect modest continued improvement in the overall economy in our markets to provide slight increases in occupancy at certain of our properties 
scheduled lease expirations we tend to lease space to smaller businesses that desire shorter term leases 
as of december   approximately of our gross leasable area is subject to leases that expire prior to december  over the last three years we have renewed approximately of our square footage expiring as a result of lease maturities 
we routinely seek to renew leases with our existing tenants prior to their expiration and typically begin discussions with tenants as early as months prior to the expiration date of the existing lease 
while our early renewal program and other leasing and marketing efforts target these expiring leases  we hope to re lease most of that space prior to expiration of the leases 
in the markets in which we operate  we obtain and analyze market rental rates through review of third party publications which provide market and submarket rental rate data and through inquiry of property owners and property management companies as to rental rates being quoted at properties which are located in close proximity to our properties and we believe display similar physical attributes as our nearby properties 
we use this data to negotiate leases with new tenants and renew leases with our existing tenants at rates we believe to be competitive in the markets for our individual properties 
due to the short term nature of our leases  and based upon our analysis of market rental rates  we believe that  in the aggregate  our current leases are at market rates 
during the year ended december   our revenue rate per square foot for renewals and new leases for comparable spaces increased when compared to the expiring revenue rate per square foot for previous leases 
as such  we expect the and expiring square footage to lease at rates which are at  or near  their current rates 
market conditions  including new supply of properties  and macroeconomic conditions in houston and nationally affecting tenant income  such as employment levels  business conditions  interest rates  tax rates  fuel and energy costs and other matters  could adversely impact our renewal rate and or the rental rates we are able to negotiate 
we continue to monitor our tenants operating performances as well as overall economic trends to evaluate any future negative impact on our renewal rates and rental rates  which could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders 
acquisitions we expect to actively seek acquisitions in the foreseeable future 
we believe that over the next few years we will continue 
table of contents to have excellent opportunities to acquire quality properties at historically attractive prices 
we have extensive relationships with community banks  attorneys  title companies and others in the real estate industry which we believe will enable us to take advantage of these market opportunities and maintain an active acquisition pipeline 
property acquisitions we seek to acquire commercial properties in high growth markets 
our acquisition targets are properties that fit our community centered properties strategy 
we define community centered properties as visibly located properties in established or developing  culturally diverse neighborhoods in our target markets  primarily in and around phoenix  chicago  dallas  san antonio and houston 
we market  lease and manage our centers to match tenants with the shared needs of the surrounding neighborhood 
those needs may include specialty retail  grocery and medical  educational and financial services 
our goal is for each property to become a whitestone branded business center or retail community that serves a neighboring five mile radius around our property

table of contents summary of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
we prepared these financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our results may differ from these estimates 
currently  we believe that our accounting policies do not require us to make estimates using assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain 
for a better understanding of our accounting policies  you should read note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we have described below the critical accounting policies that we believe could impact our consolidated financial statements most significantly 
revenue recognition 
all leases on our properties are classified as operating leases  and the related rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases 
differences between rental income earned and amounts due per the respective lease agreements are capitalized or charged  as applicable  to accrued rents and accounts receivable 
percentage rents are recognized as rental income when the thresholds upon which they are based have been met 
recoveries from tenants for taxes  insurance  and other operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the corresponding costs are incurred 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts against the portion of tenant accounts receivable which is estimated to be uncollectible 
development properties 
land  buildings and improvements are recorded at cost 
expenditures related to the development of real estate are carried at cost which includes capitalized carrying charges and development costs 
carrying charges  primarily interest  real estate taxes and loan acquisition costs  and direct and indirect development costs related to buildings under construction  are capitalized as part of construction in progress 
the capitalization of such costs ceases when the property  or any completed portion thereof  becomes available for occupancy 
prior to that time  we expense these costs as acquisition expense 
no interest  real estate taxes or loan acquisition costs were capitalized as part of construction in progress for the years ended december   and acquired properties and acquired lease intangibles 
we allocate the purchase price of the acquired properties to land  building and improvements  identifiable intangible assets and to the acquired liabilities based on their respective fair values 
identifiable intangibles include amounts allocated to acquired out of market leases  the value of in place leases and customer relationship value  if any 
we determine fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends and specific market and economic conditions that may affect the property 
factors considered by management in our analysis of determining the as if vacant property value include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  tenant demand and other economic conditions 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  tenant improvements  legal and other related expenses 
intangibles related to out of market leases and in place lease value are recorded as acquired lease intangibles and are amortized as an adjustment to rental revenue or amortization expense  as appropriate  over the remaining terms of the underlying leases 
premiums or discounts on acquired out of market debt are amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of such debt 
depreciation 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of to years for the buildings and improvements 
tenant improvements are depreciated using the straight line method over the life of the improvement or remaining term of the lease  whichever is shorter 
impairment 
we review our properties for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets  including accrued rental income  may not be recoverable through operations 
we determine whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  including the estimated residual value of the property  with the carrying cost of the property 
if impairment is indicated  a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair value 
management has determined that there has been no impairment in the carrying value of our real estate assets as of december  
table of contents accrued rents and accounts receivable 
included in accrued rent and accounts receivable are base rents  tenant reimbursements and receivables attributable to recording rents on a straight line basis 
an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rents and accounts receivable is determined based upon customer credit worthiness including expected recovery of our claim with respect to any tenants in bankruptcy  historical bad debt levels  and current economic trends 
as of december  and  we had an allowance for uncollectible accounts of million and million  respectively 
as of december   and  we recorded bad debt expense in the amount of million  million and million  respectively  related to tenant receivables that we specifically identified as potentially uncollectible based on our assessment of each tenant s credit worthiness 
bad debt expenses and any related recoveries are included in property operation and maintenance expense 
unamortized lease commissions and loan costs 
leasing commissions are amortized using the straight line method over the terms of the related lease agreements 
loan costs are amortized on the straight line method over the terms of the loans  which approximates the interest method 
costs allocated to in place leases whose terms differ from market terms related to acquired properties are amortized over the remaining life of the respective leases 
prepaids and other assets 
prepaids and other assets include escrows established pursuant to certain mortgage financing arrangements for real estate taxes and insurance and acquisition deposits which include earnest money deposits on future acquisitions 
federal income taxes 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under the code beginning with our taxable year ended december  as a reit  we generally are not subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our shareholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify to be taxed as a reit  and we intend to operate so as to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
state taxes 
in may  the state of texas adopted house bill  which modified the state s franchise tax structure  replacing the previous tax based on capital or earned surplus with one based on margin often referred to as the texas margin tax effective with franchise tax reports filed on or after january  the texas margin tax is computed by applying the applicable tax rate for us to the profit margin  which  generally  will be determined for us as total revenue less a standard deduction 
although house bill states that the texas margin tax is not an income tax  financial accounting standards board fasb asc  income taxes asc applies to the texas margin tax 
we have recorded a margin tax provision of million for the texas margin tax for each of the years ended december   and recent accounting pronouncements 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance clarifying that the disclosure of supplementary proforma information for business combinations should be presented such that revenues and earnings of the combined entity are calculated as though the relevant business combinations that occurred during the current reporting period had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
the guidance also improves the usefulness of the supplementary proforma information by requiring a description of the nature and amount of material  non recurring proforma adjustments that are directly attributable to the business combinations 
we adopted these provisions for our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  thus the application of these provisions is reflected in the supplementary proforma disclosures for our acquisitions in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of dividends and distributions to holders of our common shares and op units  including those required to maintain reit status and satisfy our current quarterly distribution target of per share and op unit  recurring expenditures  such as repairs and maintenance of our properties  non recurring expenditures  such as capital improvements and tenant improvements  debt service requirements  and  potentially  acquisitions of additional properties 
during the year ended december   our cash provided from operating activities was  and our total dividends and distributions were  therefore  we had distributions in excess of cash flow from operations of approximately  on february   we  through our operating partnership  entered into a new three year unsecured revolving credit facility  which we will use for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and redevelopment of existing properties in our portfolio 
the new facility replaced our existing unsecured revolving credit facility 
we anticipate that cash flows from operating activities and our borrowing capacity under our new credit facility will provide adequate capital for our working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments in the short term 
we also believe that cash flows from operating activities and our borrowing capacity will allow us to make all distributions required for us to continue to qualify to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
our long term capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longer term debt agreements  development and redevelopment costs  and potential acquisitions 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements with net cash from operations  long term indebtedness  sales of common shares  issuance of op units  sales of underperforming properties and other financing opportunities  including debt financing 
we believe we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long term liquidity requirements  including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of additional equity 
however  our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors  including our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders 
our ability to access the equity markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well  including general market conditions for reits and market perceptions about our company 
we expect that our rental income will increase as we continue to acquire additional properties  subsequently increasing our cash flows generated from operating activities 
we intend to continue acquiring such additional properties through equity issuances  including proceeds from our follow on offering of class b common shares in may  our initial public offering of class b common shares in august  and through debt financing 
our capital structure includes non recourse secured debt that we assumed or originated on certain properties 
we may hedge the future cash flows of certain debt transactions principally through interest rate swaps with major financial institutions 
cash and cash equivalents we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  at december   as compared to  at december  the decrease of  was primarily the result of the following sources of cash cash flow from operations of  for the year ended december  net proceeds of  from issuance of class b common shares  net proceeds of  from issuance of notes payable net of origination costs  proceeds from sales of marketable securities of  net proceeds of  from the sale of our greens road property  uses of cash payment of dividends and distributions to common shareholders and op unit holders of  investments in marketable securities of  real estate acquisitions of  additions to real estate of  payments of loans of

table of contents reconciliation of non gaap financial measures funds from operations ffo the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  defines ffo as net income loss available to common shareholders computed in accordance with us gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and extraordinary items  plus depreciation and amortization of operating properties  including our share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
we calculate ffo in a manner consistent with the nareit definition 
in october  nareit communicated to its members that the exclusion of impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate is consistent with the definition of ffo  and prior periods should be restated to be consistent with this guidance 
as we have not had any impairments in the past five years  we were not required to restate our ffo for prior periods 
management uses ffo as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using us gaap net income loss alone as the primary measure of our operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with us gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
because real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 
in addition  securities analysts  investors and other interested parties use ffo as the primary metric for comparing the relative performance of equity reits 
although our calculation of ffo is consistent with that of nareit  there can be no assurance that ffo presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under us gaap  as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness 
ffo core management believes that the computation of ffo in accordance with nareit s definition includes certain items that are not indicative of the results provided by our operating portfolio and affect the comparability of our period over period performance 
these items include  but are not limited to  gains and losses on insurance claim settlements  legal and professional fees and acquisition costs 
therefore  in addition to ffo  management uses ffo core  which we define to exclude such items 
below are the calculations of ffo and ffo core and the reconciliations to net income  which we believe is the most comparable us gaap financial measure in thousands year ended december  ffo and ffo core net income attributable to whitestone reit depreciation and amortization of real estate assets loss gain on disposal of assets net income attributable to noncontrolling interests ffo acquisition costs gain on insurance claim settlement legal and professional costs recoveries  net ffo core including amounts for discontinued operations

table of contents property net operating income noi management believes that noi is a useful measure of our property operating performance 
we define noi as operating revenues rental and other revenues less property and related expenses property operation and maintenance and real estate taxes 
other reits may use different methodologies for calculating noi  and accordingly  our noi may not be comparable to other reits 
because noi excludes general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  involuntary conversion  interest expense  interest income  provision for income taxes and gain or loss on sale or disposition of assets  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
we use noi to evaluate our operating performance since noi allows us to evaluate the impact that factors such as occupancy levels  lease structure  lease rates and tenant base have on our results  margins and returns 
in addition  management believes that noi provides useful information to the investment community about our property and operating performance when compared to other reits since noi is generally recognized as a standard measure of property performance in the real estate industry 
however  noi should not be viewed as a measure of our overall financial performance since it does not reflect general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  involuntary conversion  interest expense  interest income  provision for income taxes and loss on sale or disposition of assets  the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties 
below is the calculation of noi and the reconciliations to net income  which we believe is the most comparable gaap financial measure in thousands year ended december  property net operating income noi net income attributable to whitestone reit general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization involuntary conversion interest expense interest  dividend and other investment income provision for income taxes loss on sale or disposal of assets gain on sale of property net income attributable to noncontrolling interests noi taxes we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code beginning with our taxable year ended december  as a reit  we generally are not subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our shareholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we believe that we are organized and operate in a manner to qualify and be taxed as a reit  and we intend to operate so as to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
inflation we anticipate that the majority of our leases will continue to be triple net leases or otherwise provide that tenants pay 
table of contents for increases in operating expenses and will contain provisions that we believe will mitigate the effect of inflation 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than five years  which allows us to adjust rental rates to reflect inflation and other changing market conditions when the leases expire 
consequently  increases due to inflation  as well as ad valorem tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon our operating results 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair value relevant to our financial instruments depend upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
based upon the nature of our operations  we are not subject to foreign exchange rate or commodity price risk 
the principal market risk to which we are exposed is the risk related to interest rate fluctuations 
many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations  and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk 
our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for our borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable 
all of our financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes 
fixed interest rate debt as of december   approximately of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed interest rates  which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates 
though a change in the market interest rates affects the fair market value  it does not impact net income to shareholders or cash flows 
our total outstanding fixed interest rate debt has an average effective interest rate at this time of approximately per annum with expirations ranging from to see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail 
as of december   we had approximately million of fixed rate debt outstanding 
holding other variables constant  a increase or decrease in interest rates would cause a million decline or increase  respectively  in the fair value for our fixed rate debt 
variable interest rate debt as of december   we had million of loans  or approximately of our outstanding debt  with a floating interest rate of libor plus to 
as of december   we did not have a fixed rate hedge in place  leaving million subject to interest rate fluctuations 
the impact of a increase or decrease in interest rates on our floating rate debt would result in a decrease or increase of annual net income of approximately  respectively
