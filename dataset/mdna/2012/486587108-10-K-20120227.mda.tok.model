item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our company  kaydon corporation  is a leading designer and manufacturer of custom engineered  performance critical products  supplying a broad and diverse group of alternative energy  industrial  aerospace  defense  medical and electronic equipment and aftermarket customers 
demand for our products depends  in part  upon a wide range of general economic conditions  which affect our markets in varying ways from year to year 
in early global economic conditions were strengthening which combined with our efforts to broaden our sales efforts both internationally and in north america benefited our industrial end markets 
in the third and fourth quarters of both sales and orders were impacted by softening business conditions notably in europe which adversely affected our industrial businesses 
for the full year sales to our industrial end markets increased percent 
this contributed to the sales volume and operating income increases achieved in certain of our business segments 
conditions in our wind energy and military markets moderated as expected from the strong performances achieved in and when we benefited from strong wind energy demand and from our leading position on several major military vehicle programs which wound down in for the full year wind energy shipments were million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
we expect wind energy sales to increase in in advance of the potential expiration of the united states production tax credit ptc 
we have also opportunistically made available a portion of wind energy manufacturing capacity for the production of bearings for our other markets 
such reallocation does not require significant equipment modification 
we have taken preliminary action to both rationalize headcount and better align customer inventories in advance of potential further action in should the ptc not be extended and global renewable energy conditions remain challenged 
we anticipate military demand to be affected by the uncertainty of government funding in our performance during remains dependent on the continued strengthening of general economic and industrial conditions and the anticipated improvement in wind energy demand  both of which should offset continued expected moderation in our military business 
in april  we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of hahn gasfedern gmbh and related real estate and intangible property hahn from ulrich hahn ek hahn  located in aichwald  germany  manufactures and sells high quality gas springs  tension springs and dampers for diverse industrial markets 
hahn is an integral part of our velocity control products segment 
during our net sales totaled million  as we were able to take advantage of the effects of the improved economic conditions in many of our industrial markets and the benefits from the hahn acquisition which helped to offset most of the moderation in wind energy and military sales 
we generated net income of million and cash flow from operating activities of million during during cash and cash equivalents decreased million as we invested million to acquire hahn  million in capital expenditures  million for stock repurchases and million in our common stock dividend  which more than offset cash generated from operating activities 
the total order book for equaled million  compared to million in with the change reflecting a reduction in wind energy and military orders which were only partially offset by increased industrial orders including the orders contributed by hahn 
our year end backlog totaled million 
our investable balances provided significant interest income in early before financial markets deteriorated 
we responded to these adverse financial market conditions with an investment strategy focused on preserving cash balances 
market interest rates on these investments are now near zero percent 
as a result  our returns on our investable balances were relatively insignificant in  and on february   kaydon s board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share payable to shareholders of record as of march  with a payment date of march  we have sufficient available cash balances and committed bank credit availability under our existing million revolving credit to fund the anticipated dividend amount of million 
after payment of the special dividend and recapitalization we would have available cash and committed credit of approximately million 
however  we anticipate entering into a new revolving credit and term loan facility to fund the special dividend kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents and provide additional committed credit availability to support our objectives  including future acquisitions 
we anticipate that following the dividend  our available cash  available borrowing and future cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations and planned capital requirements 
in summary  our future performance will be impacted by general economic conditions and the strength or weakness of the manufacturing environment  the success of our efforts to continue to expand operations and improve operating efficiencies  as well as the use of available cash and borrowing capacity for future acquisitions 
the discussion which follows should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report to assist in understanding our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  capital structure and other relevant financial information

the decrease in sales compared to was attributable primarily to decreased volume of million principally of our wind energy and military products only partially offset by increases in sales volumes of velocity control products including hahn  sealing products  and to customers across our heavy equipment and machinery end markets 
these volume decreases were only partially offset by the million favorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates and the net favorable effect of increased pricing in our metal alloy business  which was principally offset by unfavorable pricing of our wind energy products 
the increase resulting from foreign exchange rate changes was principally attributable to a weaker us dollar relative to the euro and british pound on a year over year basis 
gross margin gross margin in was percent  a decrease of points from the percent gross margin in the combined effect of sales volume and product mix changes increased gross margin by points as we achieved growth in sales of higher margin products relative to lower margin products 
gross margin increased by points due to decreased expenses incurred for our manufacturing consolidation program see note to the consolidated financial statements 
more than offsetting these increases were the point adverse effect of pricing  the point adverse effect of an inventory reserve recorded related to a customer arbitration see note to the consolidated financial statements  a point reduction from the effects of foreign exchange rate changes  and a point reduction from the effect of other net cost increases 
the effect on gross margin of wind energy price reductions was greater than the positive gross margin effect of the increased pricing in our metal alloy business

analysis of operations compared to operations net sales net sales for equaled million  an increase of million or percent  compared to net sales in of million 
the growth in was attributable primarily to a million increase in sales volumes to customers across several of our principal end markets including the specialized robotic  machinery  semiconductor and medical markets  partially offset by million in net pricing reductions and million from the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
the net pricing reductions were due primarily to the contractual pass through of reduced material costs within the wind energy market 
the decrease resulting from foreign exchange rate changes was principally attributable to a stronger us dollar relative to the euro and british pound on a year over year basis

friction control products for the years ended december  change to change to dollars in millions sales operating income operating margin compared to sales in our friction control products reporting segment were million during compared to million during  a decrease of million or percent 
the sales decrease was attributable to a million decline in sales of wind energy products and a million decrease in sales to the military market principally associated with the wind down of military vehicle programs 
the decline in wind energy was due to decreased volume of million and decreased pricing of million 
sales increased to the heavy equipment and machinery markets and to the industrial markets served by our split roller bearings and specialty ball businesses 
operating income from the friction control products reporting segment during totaled million compared to million in the million decrease in operating income was due principally to million from decreased sales volume  million in decreased pricing  million in higher costs associated with a customer arbitration matter  million from the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign exchange rates and other net cost increases of million

table of contents compared to sales of our other industrial products were million during compared to million in the million sales increase was principally due to increased sales of our sealing  metal alloy  air filtration  metal forming and machine tool products businesses  which more than offset the decreased sales of our liquid filtration business 
our metal alloy business sales increase was due to the effect of higher raw material pricing on certain metals that was passed on to our customers 
our other industrial products contributed million to our operating income during compared to million during this increase in operating income was attributable to million from increased sales volumes  the million positive effect of changes in product mix and million from increased pricing  partially offset by million of other net cost increases 
compared to sales of our other industrial products were million during compared to million in the million sales increase was principally due to a recovery from reduced sales levels in in our sealing  air filtration  metal alloy and metal forming products businesses caused by the recession  which more than offset declines in our liquid filtration and machine tool components businesses 
our metal alloy business sales increase was due to the effect of higher raw material pricing on certain metals that was passed on to our customers 
our other industrial products contributed million to our operating income during compared to million during this increase in operating income was attributable to million from increased sales volumes and million from net cost reductions  but was partially offset by million from the adverse effect of product mix and million from the impact of pricing changes 
the unfavorable product mix in is largely related to the highly competitive aerospace seals market within our sealing products business which typically has lower margins  but which grew at a faster pace in relative to higher margin products 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our current ratio was to and working capital totaled million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
at december   our current ratio was to and working capital totaled million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
we have historically generated significant cash flows from operating activities to fund capital expenditures  dividends and other operating requirements 
cash flow generation has been enhanced by our continuing efforts to improve operating efficiencies  implement cost reductions and manage working capital requirements 
net cash from operating activities equaled million in  million in and million in net cash from operating activities in decreased compared to primarily due to decreased net income  increased inventories  and a decrease in accrued liabilities in compared to an increase in net cash from operating activities in increased compared to primarily due to increased net income  decreased contributions to our qualified pension plans and increased accrued liabilities at the end of net inventories at december  were million  an increase of million associated with both anticipated future sales and certain product deliveries expected to be completed in  but which have been rescheduled by the customer to meet their revised requirements 
the increase in inventory was net of an inventory reserve recorded of million associated with inventory no longer expected to be sold in the ordinary course of business and which is subject to a gain contingency related to a pending arbitration with a customer 
net inventories at december  were million  a decrease of million from the million of inventory at december  the decrease was principally attributable to a reduction in inventory within our friction control products segment  which more than offset increases in the velocity control products segment and other industrial products businesses to support higher sales levels 
based on both our long term confidence in the wind energy market and our ongoing strategic relationships with wind energy customers  we have made significant investments in support of this initiative 
we closely monitor our accounts receivable from wind energy customers and are reasonably assured that our accounts receivable are kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents fully collectible 
additionally  we believe that our inventory as of december  is fully realizable 
however  at december  and  we had approximately million of working capital  or million after reserves at december   invested on behalf of an international wind energy customer  including past due accounts receivable and inventory made on the customer s behalf and designed to its agreed upon specifications 
the customer has not paid us and has made a claim for material damages alleging that certain field performance issues of its product are attributable to the quality of the supplied bearings 
we are confident that our bearings were made to the agreed upon design specifications and that the customer s field performance issues relate to factors outside of our control 
under the documents which comprise the sales contract  the customer is obligated to pay its liability and to reimburse us for inventory costs incurred and lost profits 
in order to expedite the resolution of this matter  we agreed with the customer to enter into a mediation process  and if necessary  binding arbitration to resolve the parties claims 
the mediation process was completed in march  but was unsuccessful in resolving the matter 
during the second quarter of  a notice of binding arbitration was filed  and an arbitration panel was selected in the third quarter of in the third quarter of the arbitration tribunal issued a procedural schedule that called for completion of the binding arbitration hearings in the fourth quarter of  followed by a final decision of the arbitration panel  unless resolved sooner by agreement of the parties 
we did not reach agreement to resolve the parties claims prior to the hearing phase of the arbitration process  which was conducted in november following certain post hearing arbitration procedures  a final non appealable ruling from the arbitrators is expected in with the completion of the arbitration hearings and the absence of a settlement  the sale of the inventory cannot be expected in the ordinary course of business 
accordingly  we reserved for the value of the inventory in the fourth quarter of by million to its scrap value 
we continue to remain confident in the merits of our claim against the customer  and the potential for recovery through the arbitration process of all or a portion of the inventory remains 
with regard to the customer s claim for material damages  given the inherent uncertainty of the arbitration process  the substantial volume of evidence and testimony provided since commencement of the arbitration  and the complexity of the legal analysis involved  we believe that it is reasonably possible  but not probable  that the arbitrators would give credence to a portion of the customer s claims and that a loss has been incurred 
due to these uncertainties and complexities  no estimate of a reasonably possible loss or range of loss may be made 
this matter is within the friction control products segment 
capital expenditures to expand productive capacity  improve quality and reduce costs equaled million in  million in  and million in the decrease in capital expenditures in compared to reflects the completion of our manufacturing consolidation program

of the  shares currently authorized by the board of directors for repurchase   shares have been repurchased as of december  we may make opportunistic stock repurchases over time  the amount of which will depend on the market for our common stock and our financial condition and liquidity 
our payments to various taxing authorities were million  million and million during kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents  and tax payments are expected to be approximately million during as part of governmental efforts to react to climate change and stimulate economic growth  the american reinvestment and recovery act of authorized the department of treasury to award tax credits for qualified investments in advanced energy projects  to support new  expand  or re equip domestic manufacturing facilities 
in  we were awarded million in tax credits for our qualifying advanced energy investment which are being recognized using the flow through method 
we intend to permanently reinvest the earnings of certain international operations which can restrict our ability to use cash from our international operations for domestic needs 
we believe that we have sufficient sources of domestic liquidity in both our existing domestic cash balances and borrowing capacity to meet our needs 
we had no debt outstanding at any time during and and accordingly paid no cash interest 
in  we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders providing for a million senior revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement provides for borrowings by the company and its subsidiaries in various currencies for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  and matures on september  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fees related to our credit agreement of approximately million are being amortized as a component of interest expense over a five year period 
credit agreement fees included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet at december   equaled million 
on february   kaydon s board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share to be payable to shareholders of record as of march  with a payment date of march  we have sufficient cash balances and committed bank credit availability under our existing million revolving credit to fund the anticipated dividend amount of million 
however  we anticipate entering into a new revolving credit and term loan facility to fund the special dividend and provide additional committed credit availability to support our objectives  including future acquisitions 
we expect that our planned capital requirements  which consist of capital expenditures  dividend payments  and interest and principal payments to be incurred to fund the march special dividend  will be financed by operations and existing cash balances 
our significant contractual obligations at december  are set forth below payments due by period contractual obligations total more than years in thousands operating leases purchase obligations for property  plant and equipment total we expect to make cash contributions of approximately million to our pension plans in we regularly review our funding strategy for our pension plans 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our postretirement benefit plans in we have million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which are excluded from the above table because the timing of settlement of these liabilities cannot be reasonably estimated 
corporate development our corporate development efforts are intended to complement internal growth through the acquisition of additional companies consistent with our well disciplined criteria 
we maintain a disciplined acquisition program  which has made important contributions to our growth 
in april  we purchased all of the outstanding shares of hahn gasfedern gmbh and related real estate and intangible property hahn from ulrich hahn ek hahn manufactures and sells high quality gas springs  tension springs and dampers for diverse industrial markets

our estimated legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with claims  lawsuits and environmental matters are accrued in the consolidated financial statements 
the costs accrued at december  and were not material 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we continually evaluate the estimates  judgments and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  our estimates are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals and various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from our current estimates 
we have identified certain accounting policies and estimates  described below  that are the most critical to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions regarding future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known or anticipated engineering change orders  new products and other factors 
we believe the accounting estimates related to inventories to be critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used to determine the valuation of inventories  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change and cause projected outcomes to vary 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long lived assets including fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets may warrant revision or that remaining balances may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that such costs should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of the long lived assets that is compared to the carrying value of the asset to evaluate whether the asset costs are recoverable 
we believe the accounting estimates related to long lived asset impairment to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  requires our subjective judgments and the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  increasing the sensitivity of assumptions made  thus projected outcomes may vary 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on us  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note and note in this annual report for additional information regarding long lived assets 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results 
currently eight of our reporting units have goodwill balances 
we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with the reporting unit s carrying value 
in accordance with current accounting guidance  we have included deferred income taxes in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from an estimate of discounted future cash flows 
the discounted cash flow model for each reporting unit requires judgmental assumptions regarding each reporting unit s specific projected revenue growth  future operating margins kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents and working capital and capital expenditure requirements  in addition to assumptions of appropriate discount rates and terminal values based on growth rates in perpetuity 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our reporting units  it is possible a material change could occur 
goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
in  as of our annual assessment date  a discount rate was developed which is the value weighted average of our estimated cost of equity and estimated cost of debt cost of capital derived using both known and estimated  customary  marketplace metrics  including a size risk premium 
in  depending on the assessed risk of the reporting unit  we increased the discount rate used to calculate the fair value of certain reporting units and used discount rates of to percent to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit 
in arriving at future discounted cash flows for each reporting unit  we evaluate the appropriate growth rate in perpetuity for each of our reporting units to calculate a terminal value of cash flows following each reporting unit s five year planning period 
the terminal value for each reporting unit is determined based on that reporting unit s specific operating cash flow at the end of the planning period and the reporting unit s assumed growth rate in perpetuity 
in  as of our annual assessment date  we used a growth rate in perpetuity of to percent depending on the assessed long term growth of the reporting unit 
potential goodwill impairment is identified if a reporting unit s carrying value is more than a reporting unit s fair value 
if this occurs  normally a third party valuation specialist is utilized to assist us in determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the amount of any actual impairment loss is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
our goodwill impairment testing in revealed that the excess of the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units tested over their carrying value expressed as a percentage of the carrying value as of the july annual testing date ranged from approximately percent to approximately percent 
assumptions regarding discount rate  revenue growth rates  operating profit margins and perpetuity growth rate may have a significant effect on the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical ten percent decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit 
the results of this ten percent hypothetical change in fair values would not have changed our conclusion that fair values exceeded carrying values in each case by a material amount 
certain trademarks are our only indefinite lived intangible assets 
we identify impairment of these trademarks by comparing their fair value to their carrying values 
the fair values of the trademarks are calculated based on estimates of discounted future cash flows related to the net amount of royalty expenses avoided due to the existence of the trademarks 
we believe the accounting estimates related to impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of discounted future cash flows and terminal values  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require our subjective judgments  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made  projected outcomes based on the assumptions made can vary  and the calculation of implied fair value is inherently subject to estimates 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on us  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding goodwill and intangible assets 
retirement benefits our employee pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations recorded in the financial statements are dependent on our estimates provided to and used by our actuaries in calculating such amounts 
we believe the accounting estimates related to retirement benefits to be critical accounting estimates because of the wide range of assumptions used in deriving yearly contribution and expense amounts as well as the amounts recorded for retirement benefits kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents in our financial statements 
significant assumptions include judgments regarding discount rates  health care cost trend rates  salary growth rates and long term returns on plan assets 
we have developed estimates based on historical experience  information from third party professionals and various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
in developing the discount rate assumption used to determine the pension and postretirement benefit obligations  we use the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits 
the equivalent weighted average discount rate is calculated by imputing the interest rate that equates the total present value with the stream of future cash flows 
health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical data  the near term outlook and on an assessment of likely long term trends 
salary growth assumptions reflect our long term experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
long term return on plan assets is based on an evaluation of historical and expected returns of the individual asset classes comprising the total plan assets 
for individual categories of equity securities  historical total and real rates of return are considered  together with inflation and overall market factors including dividend yield  earnings growth  changes in price to earnings ratios and volatility of returns 
for various fixed income asset categories  expected long term returns are determined after consideration of current yields on fixed income securities  inflation  historical yields relative to benchmarks and long term default rates 
assumed discount rates  expected rate of return on plan assets and rate of compensation increases have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension plans

while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and postretirement benefits costs and obligations 
the current market conditions for highly rated corporate bonds has a significant effect on our assumption for the discount rate used to determine projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost  where an increase decrease in interest rates will result in a decrease increase in the projected benefit obligation and decrease increase in net periodic benefit cost 
at december   the discount rates assumed were lower than those at kaydon corporation form k

changes in current conditions in financial markets do not significantly alter the underlying long term expected return on plan assets each year 
however  actual returns compared to the expected return on plan assets have a significant effect on the funded status of the plans and consequently the net periodic pension cost and plan contributions in future periods 
the actual rate of return on plan assets in was lower than the expected long term rate of return on plan assets reducing the funded status at december  and increasing the net periodic pension cost in the actual rate of return on plan assets in and significantly exceeded the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
our cash contributions required to fund our pension plans in are expected to be million 
the cash contributions and future expected contributions are expected to have only a minor impact on our current and future liquidity as we expect to meet funding requirements from cash generated in our operations or our available cash resources 
the expected age graded rate of compensation increase was adjusted downward to reflect our long term experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation

income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are reviewed for recoverability by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
income tax is provided based upon an effective tax rate that is dependent upon tax regulations governing the regions in which we conduct business  geographic composition of worldwide earnings  the availability of tax credits and other factors 
we have liabilities recorded for unrecognized tax benefits totaling million as of december   all of which would affect the effective tax rate 
it is our policy to include interest and penalties incurred due to underpayment or late payment of income taxes due to a taxing authority on a net of tax basis as a component of income tax expense 
we have recorded million in liabilities for tax related interest and penalties on our consolidated balance sheet  as of december  the company does not expect that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next twelve months 
the company  or one or more of its subsidiaries  operates and files income tax returns in the united states  various states and foreign jurisdictions 
foreign jurisdictions significant to the company include germany and the united kingdom 
with limited exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal tax examinations for years before  state examinations for years before  german tax examinations for years before  or united kingdom tax examinations for years before we believe the accounting estimates related to income taxes to be critical accounting estimates because the range of assumptions used to determine deferred tax assets and liabilities and to record current tax benefits and liabilities  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change from year to year causing projected outcomes to vary

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  which exist as part of our ongoing business operations including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to investments in cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
all highly liquid investments  including highly liquid debt and investment instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  are considered cash equivalents 
we place our investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of exposure to any one issuer 
a decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our pre tax earnings 
we conduct business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe  mexico and asia 
therefore  changes in the value of currencies in these regions affect our financial condition and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
we have mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of our currency exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which certain costs are local currency based 
in addition  periodically  we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
a percent change in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on our financial condition and cash flows
