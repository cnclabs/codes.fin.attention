item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and business strategy theragenics corporation  a delaware corporation formed in  is a medical device company serving the surgical products and cancer treatment markets  operating in two business segments 
the terms company  we  us  or our mean theragenics corporation and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements 
our surgical products business manufactures  markets and sells disposable devices primarily utilized in certain surgical procedures 
our brachytherapy seed business manufactures  markets and sells radioactive seeds primarily utilized in the treatment of early stage prostate cancer 
at the present time  both of our segments do business primarily in the united states 
our surgical products business is the faster growing of our businesses and has been supported by the cash flows generated by our market leading brachytherapy seed business and our flagship theraseed brand 
in our surgical products business we plan to grow and diversify revenues by adding product offerings and manufacturing capabilities  expanding the applications and markets in which we compete  and gaining scale to improve profitability 
our surgical products business was built through the acquisitions of cp medical corp 
in may  galt medical corporation in august  and needletech products  inc in july we currently manufacture almost  products in this business as part of three broad product platforms  wound closure  vascular access and specialty needles 
to date we have maintained the names and brands under which each of these companies previously manufactured  marketed and sold their products 
we serve a number of markets and applications  including  among other areas  interventional cardiology  interventional radiology  vascular surgery  orthopedics  plastic surgery  dental surgery  urology  veterinary medicine sutures  pain management  endoscopy  and spinal surgery 
with the exception of veterinary sutures  our surgical products hold relatively small market shares 
our products include both finished goods and components 
our products are sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers oems and to a network of distributors 
on a pro forma basis  our surgical products business has achieved a compound annual revenue growth rate of from through pro forma  assuming all acquisitions had been made at the beginning of 
we have accomplished this primarily by increasing sales to existing customers and  to a lesser extent  adding new customers 
further  we achieved this revenue growth during a period which included severe economic difficulties 
our strategy for increasing sales and scale going forward includes becoming more integral within the supply chain of our customers both for existing products and for our customers development programs which may allow us to increase sales to existing and new customers from all product platforms  developing new products internally  acquiring products  licenses  and other intellectual property  acquiring businesses and  entering certain markets outside the united states 
we have operated our brachytherapy seed business since  emerging from the development stage in historically our brachytherapy seed segment has generated strong cash flows  which have enabled us to diversify our business substantially 
positive cash flows from our brachytherapy seed business continue despite an industry wide decline in brachytherapy procedures in the united states which began about six years ago 
the overall brachytherapy industry in the united states is now experiencing difficulties primarily due to competition from other treatments 
many of these competing treatments enjoy favorable medicare reimbursement rates relative to brachytherapy reimbursement rates 
we believe this results in a non level playing field for brachytherapy device manufacturers  providers  and patients 
one of the primary competitive treatments provided by our radiation oncologist customers is intensity modulated radiation therapy  or imrt 
imrt enjoys substantially higher reimbursement rates than brachytherapy yet  clinical studies do not indicate that imrt delivers improved outcomes 
we believe the market positioning and heavy promotion of robotic surgery for prostate cancer treatment has also adversely affected the number of brachytherapy procedures performed 
despite these industry wide difficulties we have maintained positive cash flows in our brachytherapy business for a variety of reasons including  among other things  the relatively fixed nature of our brachytherapy seed manufacturing costs  our ability to anticipate changes in market conditions  our ability to respond to government controlled pricing policies surrounding reimbursement of our products and  more recently  increasing our overall market share 
at the present time we believe that we have additional opportunities to increase our market share through additional strategic agreements  diversification of our product and service offerings  and potential opportunities in markets outside of the united states 
one such opportunity was the february acquisition of core oncology s prostate brachytherapy customer base see below 
we believe we have these opportunities to expand and broaden our distribution channels because of  among other things  the reliability of our supply  the quality of our products  the quality of our direct sales force  and our long term commitment to the brachytherapy industry including patient education  direct to consumer advertising  and congressional lobbying for fair reimbursement 
ii acquisition of core oncology s prostate brachytherapy customers on february   we acquired core oncology s prostate brachytherapy customer base 
this transaction is expected to substantially increase our share of the iodine segment of the prostate brachytherapy market 
we expect million to million of incremental revenue in our brachytherapy segment for the remaining portion of calendar from this transaction and for the transaction to be accretive to earnings and to generate positive operating cash flow in our total brachytherapy segment revenue was million in in addition to the customer base  we also acquired certain packaging technologies 
we did not acquire core s facilities  manufacturing equipment or processes  or core s employees 
the total earn out based purchase price is expected to be approximately million to million 
we paid million in cash as a prepayment for a portion of the earn out at closing and will make six quarterly earn out payments thereafter  beginning in june core s prostate brachytherapy sales were approximately million for their fiscal year ended june  and million for the six months ended december  results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue following is a summary of revenue by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december  in thousands revenue by segment year ended december  surgical products product sales license and fee income total surgical products brachytherapy seed product sales license and fee income total brachytherapy seed intersegment eliminations consolidated product sales license and fee income total consolidated surgical products segment revenue in our surgical products business increased in over we believe this reflects the variable and unpredictable ordering patterns of our larger customers  especially on a quarter to quarter basis 
also  it has been widely reported that consumers are making fewer visits to doctors offices  which in turn is reducing demand for medical devices 
this trend may have a negative effect on revenue 
open orders in our surgical products segment were million at december  compared to million at december  open orders represent orders from customers for future delivery that we believe to be firm 
open orders are not guaranteed shipments  and they are subject to cancellation or delay 
backlog in our surgical products business was  at december  and  at december  backlog represents orders included in open orders  but for which we have missed promised shipment dates 
a significant portion of the products in our surgical business continue to be sold to oems and a network of distributors 
ordering patterns of these customers vary and are difficult to predict 
accordingly  surgical products revenue is subject to fluctuation  especially on a quarter to quarter basis 
in addition  revenue has been and will continue to be affected by our customers response to efforts by hospitals to reduce inventories and to conserve cash due to the difficult economic climate and macroeconomic uncertainties 
all of these factors may cause the fluctuations in our results to be even more volatile from period to period 
ii brachytherapy seed segment we sell our theraseed palladium device directly to healthcare providers and to third party distributors 
we also sell iodine based devices  and other brachytherapy related products  directly to healthcare providers 
our brachytherapy product sales decreased in from we believe that the prostate brachytherapy industry in the united states continues to experience pressure from newer forms of treatment 
some competitive forms of treatment have increased their market share  especially those with medicare reimbursement levels that are higher than reimbursement levels for brachytherapy 
these competitive forms of alternative treatments include imrt and robotic surgery 
in addition to competing treatment options that enjoy favorable reimbursement rates  we believe brachytherapy seed volume and revenue are also affected by disruptive pricing from other brachytherapy providers and uncertainties surrounding reimbursement 
in february we acquired core oncology s prostate brachytherapy customer base see above under overview and business strategy 
this transaction is expected to result in million to million of incremental revenue in our brachytherapy segment in calendar we have non exclusive distribution agreements in place for our theraseed device 
under our third party distribution agreements  we are the exclusive palladium seed supplier for the treatment of prostate cancer for each distributor  and each distributor has the non exclusive right to sell theraseed in the us and canada 
certain agreements also provide distributors with the right to distribute theraseed for the treatment of solid localized tumors other than in the prostate and with rights to distribute to certain locations outside of north america 
such applications non prostate and outside of north america have not been material and are not expected to become material in the near future 
our principal non exclusive distribution agreement is with cr bard bard 
our agreement with bard provides for automatic one year extensions of the term  unless either party gives notice of its intent not to renew at least twelve months prior to the end of the current term 
the current term expires december  and will be automatically extended for one additional year unless either party gives notice of its intent not to extend by december  sales to bard by our brachytherapy segment represented and of brachytherapy seed segment revenue in and  respectively 
our surgical products segment also sells to bard 
total consolidated sales to bard  including sales in our brachytherapy seed segment and our surgical products segment  represented and of consolidated revenue in and  respectively 
core became an additional non exclusive distributor of theraseed in january in february  we terminated our agreement with core due to core s failure to satisfy its financial obligation to us in accordance with the contractual terms of the agreement 
core had been attempting to become current with amounts due to us 
however  litigation filed against core by a third party in january created what we viewed as an unacceptable level of uncertainty surrounding core s ability to satisfy their financial obligations to us for both current and ongoing sales 
subsequent to termination of the agreement  we continued to supply theraseed to core on a prepaid basis 
sales to core in our brachytherapy segment totaled approximately and of total brachytherapy seed segment revenue for in and  respectively 
in the latter half of  certain customers who previously purchased theraseed through core began purchasing either from us on a direct basis or through one of our other theraseed distributors 
in february we acquired core s prostate brachytherapy customer base 
see above under overview and business strategy 
we also currently have other non exclusive distribution agreements in place for theraseed  none of which represented or more of our brachytherapy product sales in and we may pursue additional distribution agreements for both palladium and iodine products in an effort to increase market share 
we may also have opportunities to enter certain markets outside of the united states with an iodine device 
we believe that medicare reimbursement policies have affected the brachytherapy market and will continue to affect the brachytherapy market 
prior to  medicare provided reimbursement for brachytherapy seeds under the charges adjusted to costs methodology  which is based on the actual invoiced cost of the seeds and which we sometimes refer to as a pass through methodology 
the centers for medicare medicaid services cms published a final hospital outpatient prospective payment system opps on november  with fixed prospective payment rates for brachytherapy seeds 
this fixed opps  which we sometimes refer to as fixed reimbursement  went in effect on january  the fixed per seed rate at which medicare reimburses hospitals for the purchase of seeds is established annually by cms 
we expect to continue to support efforts to urge congress and cms to replace this fixed reimbursement rule by returning to the pass through reimbursement policies which existed prior to fixed reimbursement policies at cms can be expected to lead to pricing pressure from hospitals and other healthcare providers  and to have an adverse effect on our brachytherapy revenue 
the extent of the effect is impossible for us to predict  especially when fixed reimbursement policies coincide with competition from competing technologies for the treatment of early stage prostate cancer  which enjoy favorable cms reimbursement rates even though these technologies are less proven than brachytherapy and uncertainties regarding the implementation and impact of healthcare reform generally 
these factors could have an adverse effect on brachytherapy revenue 
ii license fees in our brachytherapy segment increased  or  in over license fees include fees from the licensing of our therasphere product  a medical device used for the treatment of liver cancer 
licensing fees also includes fees related to the licensing of certain intellectual property related to a brachytherapy catheter based delivery system that we developed 
this delivery system is primarily utilised in the treatment of breast cancer 
the licensing agreement  which was executed in may  provides for a minimal non refundable initial license fee and non refundable continuing royalties based upon sales subject to certain minimums 
cost and expenses associated with our license agreements are not material 
operating income and costs and expenses following is a summary of operating income by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december  in thousands year ended december  surgical products brachytherapy seed intersegment eliminations consolidated surgical products segment operating income in our surgical products segment increased to  in from  in our gross profit margins on sales were approximately in compared to in gross margins continue to be affected by changes in product and customer mix 
during we were also impacted by changes in customer ordering patterns  erp implementation and severe winter storms causing the closure of our dallas  texas plant for several days in the first quarter 
as a result of these and other items  our backlog fluctuated and we incurred higher overtime  utilized more temporary workers and experienced operating inefficiencies 
gross margins were also affected in by increased material costs  some of which were not passed on to our customers 
items affecting comparability between the and periods include certain expenses that were only incurred in either or  including the following in thousands year ended december  acquisition proposal expenses a professional fees b moving related expenses c core receivables d a acquisition proposal expenses related to expenses to consider  address  and respond to an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
b professional fees related to our legal action against the former owner of cp medical to enforce certain non compete agreements and to protect the trade secrets and other assets of that business 
c moving related expenses associated with the move into our new specialty needle manufacturing facility 
d core receivables represent amounts due from core oncology for which we believed collectability was doubtful 
in addition  corporate overhead allocated to our surgical products segment increased in primarily due to higher professional fees  compensation  and depreciation associated with our new erp system 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in amortization of purchased intangibles in the periods as certain intangible assets have become fully amortized 
research and development r d expenses decreased  or  in from our r d program is intended to focus on product extensions  next generation products  and new products that are complementary to our current product lines and that support our customers product lines 
our r d program is directed toward k products that have an established market and not on products that require lengthy and expensive clinical trials 
looking forward  our results are expected to be affected by the timing of these investments 
ii during  we have continued development of a corporate wide enterprise resource planning erp system 
as our erp system was under development  we capitalized certain internal costs associated with its development 
these costs  which consisted primarily of employee payroll and related expenses  totaled  and  in and  respectively  in our surgical products segment 
upon completion of the erp system development at each location  these development costs will no longer be capitalized but will be charged as operating expenses 
we expect to complete the system development at the remaining location within the next twelve months 
looking forward  we expect a number of items to continue to affect the profitability in our surgical products business including  among other things ordering patterns of our larger oem and distributor customers  costs incurred to address significant changes in demand  continued investments in infrastructure  r d  products  and companies as we make investments to support anticipated future growth and to develop products to address growth opportunities  changes in product mix and sales channels  with sales through oem channels generally carrying a relatively lower gross profit margin and sales through distributor channels generally carrying a somewhat higher gross profit margin  continued pricing pressure from customers  the implementation of our new  corporate wide erp systems  the increasing scale of our surgical products business  and trends of consumers making fewer visits to doctors offices and the effect on demand for medical devices 
brachytherapy seed segment operating income in our brachytherapy business increased to million in from million in manufacturing related expenses in our brachytherapy business tend to be relatively fixed in nature 
accordingly  even modest changes in revenue can have a significant impact on operating income 
gross margin and operating income in our brachytherapy seed business are expected to continue to be highly dependent on sales levels due to this high fixed cost component 
the increase in license and fee income in offset the decline in product sales 
the primary expense item affecting comparability between the periods was bad debt expense related to core oncology 
in we recorded  as bad debt expense related to amounts due from core for which we believed collectability was doubtful 
in we recorded million of bad debt expense related to core 
in february we acquired core s prostate brachytherapy customers 
see above under overview and business strategy 
corporate overhead costs allocated to our brachytherapy segment increased from due to increases in professional fees  compensation  and depreciation associated with our new erp system 
we were able to reduce some operating expenses during including advertising and personnel related costs 
looking forward  we may not be able to continue to reduce our operating costs 
non operating income expense a summary of our interest expense is as follows year ended december  interest paid or accrued  including loan fees fair value adjustment interest capitalized total interest expense interest expense paid or accrued  including loan fees  is related to our effective interest rates and the level of our outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement 
fair value adjustments are related to our interest rate swaps 
such fair value adjustments are unrealized gains and losses and reflect the period to period changes in the estimated fair value of our swaps 
interest capitalized primarily relates to the development of our erp system 
interest capitalized in is expected to be similar to levels 
our weighted average effective rate was at december  ii we manage our interest rate risk using interest rate swaps associated with outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement  as our interest rates are floating rates based on libor 
we do not hold or issue interest rate swaps for trading purposes  and we hold no other derivative financial instruments other than interest rate swaps 
we enter into interest rate swaps that are designed to hedge the interest rate risk but are not designated as hedging instruments  as defined under guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized as interest expense 
such changes in fair value are based on  among other things  discounted cash flows based upon current market expectations about future amounts  yield curves  and mid market pricing 
accordingly  the fair value of our interest rate swaps is subject to fluctuation and may have a significant effect on our results of operations in future periods 
additionally  the counterparty to our interest rate swaps is the lender under our credit agreement 
accordingly  we are exposed to counterparty credit risk from this financial institution 
we entered into interest rate swaps based on the relationship with this financial institution as our lender and on its credit rating and the rating of its parent company 
we continue to monitor our counterparty credit risk 
other income in includes  received in the settlement of the lawsuit with the former owner of cp medical 
interest income was not material in or income tax expense our effective income tax rate  which includes federal and state income taxes  was approximately and in and  respectively 
looking forward  state and investment tax and r d credits may cause fluctuations in our effective income tax rate for financial reporting purposes 
future tax rates can be affected by  among other things  tax expense for items unrelated to actual taxable income such as the write off of deferred tax assets associated with share based compensation  changes in tax regulations  changes in statutory tax rates  changes in the tax jurisdictions in which we must file income tax returns  and many other items that affect the taxability and deductibility of our revenue and expenses and for which we cannot currently predict 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue surgical products segment revenue in our surgical products business increased in over all three of our general product categories  including wound closure  vascular access  and specialty needles  recorded organic growth during the majority of our revenue growth was driven by our vascular access and wound closure products 
our organic revenue growth was primarily a result of increased sales to existing customers 
backlog in our surgical products business was  at december  and  at december  backlog represents orders included in open orders  but for which we have missed promised shipment dates 
during the first quarter of  we experienced a spike in demand and changes in customer purchasing behavior 
these factors increased our backlog early in this increase in our backlog added to an already high level of open orders including backlog that we had entering into the year 
in an attempt to compensate for the additional lead time we were experiencing in shipping orders  some customers added to existing orders 
we incurred overtime  hired temporary labor  and added shifts  among other actions  to help relieve our backlog and address opportunities during the first quarter 
a portion of the increase in product sales experienced in resulted from reducing our backlog 
brachytherapy seed segment our brachytherapy product sales decreased in from our strategy of increasing market share through new distribution agreements helped to offset the continued year over year industry wide decline in procedures 
this reduced the decline in product sales we would have otherwise experienced in indeed  our product sales increased in the second half of compared to the second half of license fees in our brachytherapy segment increased  or  in over license fees include fees from the licensing of our therasphere product  a medical device used for the treatment of liver cancer 
license fees also includes fees related to the licensing of certain intellectual property related to an expandable brachytherapy delivery system that we developed 
this agreement  which was executed in may  provides for a minimal non refundable initial license fee and non refundable continuing royalties based upon sales subject to certain minimums 
ii operating income loss and costs and expenses surgical products segment operating income in our surgical products segment decreased to  in from million in affecting profitability in the periods was a decline in our gross profit margins on product sales 
our gross profit margins were approximately in compared to in this decline was driven by several factors spikes in demand early in  continuing changes in customer behavior  pricing pressures  changes in product mix and distribution channels  and the move to our new specialty needle manufacturing facility 
we experienced a spike in demand during the first quarter of  increasing our backlog and putting pressure on certain facilities that were already at or near capacity 
to address the spike in demand and backorders  we ran overtime  brought in temporary labor and implemented a third shift at one plant  among other things 
these additional costs eroded our gross margins 
amplifying the costs associated with these actions were changes in customer behavior 
recurring changes in order quantities and requested delivery dates of orders reduced the ability of our operations to efficiently address production requirements 
our former specialty needle manufacturing plant was running at near capacity  putting a strain on operations 
we also saw an increase in our oem sales relative to our dealer sales during oem sales generally carry a lower gross profit margin 
additionally  we experienced pricing pressure from customers and from the need to respond to aggressive pricing behavior of competitors 
we were able to reduce the backlog experienced early in and reduce or eliminate some of the additional costs we had incurred to address the circumstances that existed during that time 
we also implemented certain measures to better control costs and margins on an ongoing basis 
however  we continued to experience changes in customer behavior  ordering and pricing pressures which in turn  caused variability in our gross margins from period to period 
also affecting our gross margins was the move to our new specialty needle facility in july we experienced inefficiencies  such as planned downtime  to facilitate the move 
our new facility  which is larger than our previous operating facilities  also has higher operating costs associated with it 
another factor reducing income in the periods was legal fees of  associated with our initiation of legal action against the former owner of cp medical 
this legal action was intended to enforce certain non compete agreements and to protect the trade secrets and other assets of that business  which we acquired in we had no such legal fees in the action was settled in october  and no further significant legal fees are expected to be incurred in this matter 
moving related expenses of  were incurred in in connection with the move to our new  larger specialty needle manufacturing facility 
these expenses were included in selling  general and administrative expenses and in loss on disposal of assets in our statement of earnings 
we completed the move to the new facility in the third quarter of bad debt expense also increased in  primarily a result of amounts due from core for which we believed collection was doubtful of approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses  other than the aforementioned legal  moving and bad debt expenses  were of revenue in compared to in research and development r d expenses decreased  or  in from during  we continued development of a corporate wide enterprise resource planning erp system 
as our erp system was under development  we capitalized certain internal costs associated with its development 
these costs  which consisted primarily of employee payroll and related expenses  totaled  and  in and  respectively  in our surgical products segment 
brachytherapy seed segment operating income in our brachytherapy business decreased to million in from million in manufacturing related expenses in our brachytherapy business tend to be relatively fixed in nature 
accordingly  even modest changes in revenue can have a significant impact on operating income 
the decline in product sales had a negative effect on operating income in increases in our license and fee income contributed to profitability as there were minimal costs associated with those licensing agreements 
the increase in license and fee income in partially offset the declines in product sales 
we were able to decrease some operating expenses during  including personnel related costs  advertising and professional fees 
our brachytherapy business also absorbed fewer corporate overhead costs since we allocate corporate costs based upon the relative revenue of our business segments 
corporate overhead costs allocated to our brachytherapy business declined  in from ii partially offsetting reductions in operating expenses noted in the preceding paragraph was million of bad debt expense related to amounts due from core for which we believe collection is doubtful 
we terminated our distribution agreement with core in february and in february we acquired core s prostate brachytherapy customers 
see above under overview and business strategy 
non operating income expense other income in includes  received in the settlement of the lawsuit with the former owner of cp medical 
interest income was not material in or income tax expense our effective income tax rate  which includes federal and state income taxes  was approximately in and in  our tax rate was reduced by approximately  of state investment tax credits and r d tax credits 
a significant portion of these credits in related to the construction of our new needle manufacturing facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for our judgment in their application 
the accounting policies described below are those which we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and are areas in which our judgment in selecting an available alternative might produce a materially different result 
marketable securities 
we review our investments in marketable securities for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value  the duration of any market decline  our intent and ability to hold to maturity or expected recovery  and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
we perform research and analysis  and monitor market conditions to identify potential impairments 
due to the severe volatility and disruptions related to the us and global investment and credit markets  we are exposed to the risk of changes in fair value of our marketable securities in future periods  which may cause us to take impairment charges that we do not currently anticipate 
while we will continue to research  analyze and monitor our investments  we cannot predict what effect the current investment and credit market circumstances might have on our portfolio going forward 
you can find more information related to the valuation of our marketable securities in note d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  liquidity and capital resources in management s discussion and analysis  and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  all of which are included in this report 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
our estimates can result in differences from the actual useful lives of certain assets 
the significant portion of property and equipment includes cyclotrons  which are utilized in our brachytherapy business  and manufacturing buildings 
as of december   we owned and operated eight cyclotrons  the first of which entered service in the estimated service life of our cyclotron equipment is years 
at december   the net book value of our cyclotrons was million 
the estimated service life of our buildings is years 
we will continue to periodically examine estimates used for depreciation for reasonableness 
if we determine that the useful life of property or equipment should be shortened or lengthened  depreciation expense would be adjusted accordingly for the remaining useful lives of the identified assets 
we assess the impairment of our depreciable assets including property and equipment whenever events or circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
in the event the expected undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the estimation of fair value  whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held for sale  also involves judgment 
it is possible that our estimates of fair value may change and impact our financial condition and results of operations 
ii intangible assets 
our intangible assets are determined to have finite lives and are amortized over their useful lives using a method that is expected to reflect the pattern of its economic benefit 
when a pattern of economic benefit cannot be determined  or if the straight line method results in greater amortization  then the straight line method is used 
to date  all finite lived intangible assets have been amortized using the straight line method 
we also review finite lived intangible assets for impairment to ensure they are appropriately valued if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
allowance for doubtful accounts and returns 
we make estimates and use our judgments in connection with establishing an allowance for the possibility that portions of our accounts receivable balances may become uncollectible or subject to return 
accounts receivable are reduced by this allowance 
specifically  we analyze accounts receivable in relation to customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  changes in our customer payment history  and changes in sales returns history in establishing this allowance 
it is possible that these or other underlying factors could change and impact our financial position and results of operations 
allowance for obsolete inventory 
we review inventory periodically and record an estimated allowance for inventory that has become obsolete  that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  or that is in excess of expected requirements 
specifically  we analyze inventory in relation to sales history  inventory turnover and days supply on hand  competing products  current economic trends  changes in our customers ordering histories  and historical write offs 
our estimate is subjective and dependent on our estimates of future demand for a particular product 
if our estimate of future demand exceeds actual demand  we may have to increase the allowance for obsolete inventory for that product and record a charge to cost of product sales 
asset retirement obligations 
we estimate the future cost of asset retirement obligations  discount that cost to its present value  and record a corresponding asset and liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including future decommissioning costs  inflation  cost of capital  and market risk premiums 
the nature of these estimates requires us to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations 
revisions to the estimates may be required based on such things as changes to cost estimates or the timing of future cash outlays 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis 
our asset retirement obligations consist primarily of decommissioning obligations related to our brachytherapy seed manufacturing equipment and facilities 
share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of guidance issued by fasb 
under this method  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we utilize the black scholes model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are based on factual data derived from public sources 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require significant judgment  which makes them critical accounting estimates 
our expected volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of our stock 
with respect to the weighted average option life assumption  we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises 
accounting for income taxes 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws and our interpretation of current tax laws 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our tax provision and our deferred income tax assets and liabilities  including the valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could differ materially from our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and recognize the tax benefit only as reassessment demonstrates that they are realizable 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for the valuation allowance each reporting period 
at such time  if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable  the valuation allowance is adjusted 
in the future if  based on the facts and circumstances surrounding our ability to generate adequate future taxable income  it becomes more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  the valuation allowance may be required to be increased 
we review all of our tax positions 
the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions are recognized only if it is more likely than not that we will be able to sustain a position taken on an income tax return 
we have concluded that there were no significant uncertain tax positions as of december  and our policy is to recognize accrued interest expense and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
ii contingencies 
from time to time we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including  for example  disputes on agreements  employment disputes and other commercial disputes  the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for extended periods of time 
in some cases  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures 
we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for damages and or costs related to claims  settlements and judgments where we have assessed that a loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
legal costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred 
commitments and other contractual obligations contractual obligations we lease equipment and production  warehouse  office and other space under non cancelable leases that expire at various dates through august we also have million of borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement 
our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows amounts in thousands total less than year years years more than years obligation operating lease obligations rental space and equipment borrowings under credit agreement interest payable on borrowings total borrowings other obligations total represents minimum rental payments for operating leases  one of which is subject to adjustment based on the consumer price index 
includes million outstanding under a term loan payable at  monthly through june   and million outstanding under million revolving credit facility  which matures october interest on outstanding borrowings under credit agreement at december  is based on effective interest rates at december  letter of credit we have a letter of credit outstanding under the credit facility as of december  totaling  this letter of credit is related to asset retirement obligations of long lived assets 
liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  operational investments to support growth such as research and development programs  and acquisitions of businesses and technologies 
we have cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and million at december  and  respectively 
marketable securities consisted primarily of high credit quality corporate and municipal obligations in accordance with our investment policies 
see cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities below for more information 
working capital was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital is primarily due to the classification of million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility as a short term liability at december  our credit facility expires on october  at december   all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were classified as long term and  accordingly  were not a part of working capital 
ii cash provided by operations was million in compared to million in cash provided by operations consists of net earnings  plus non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization  deferred income taxes  and changes in balance sheet items such as accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and payables and higher income tax payments 
the decline in was primarily a result of the increase in inventories to support growth in our surgical products segment and higher income taxes paid 
capital expenditures totaled million in and million in the expenditures were primarily for the development of our new erp system 
the expenditures were primarily for the construction of our new specialty needle manufacturing facility and  to a lesser extent  the development of our new erp system 
construction of our new facility was completed in july looking forward  we expect our rate of capital expenditures  exclusive of the core asset acquisition  to be consistent with levels 
cash used by financing activities was million in both and cash used for financing activities primarily consisted of principal repayments of our outstanding borrowings  in accordance with the terms of our credit agreement 
the terms of our credit agreement require monthly principal payments of  through june  r d expenses were million in and million in we expect to continue to use cash in to support growth in the surgical products segment  especially for r d 
looking forward  we expect r d expense levels in to be similar to the level 
however  r d activities can be complex  and expense levels are also dependent upon the discovery of opportunities of which we are not currently aware 
accordingly  r d expenses are subject to significant variability form period to period 
on february   we acquired core oncology s prostate brachytherapy customer base 
in addition to the customer base  we also acquired certain packaging technologies 
we did not acquire core s facilities  manufacturing equipment or processes  or core s employees 
the total purchase price is expected to be approximately million to million 
we paid million in cash as a prepayment of a portion of the earn out at closing  and will make six quarterly earn out payments thereafter  beginning in june we may also continue to use cash for increased marketing and support activities in our brachytherapy seed business and in the pursuit of additional diversification efforts such as product development  the purchase of technologies  products  companies  and other strategic initiatives 
we believe that current cash  cash equivalents  and investment balances and cash from future operations will be sufficient to meet our current short term anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
however  continued disruption and instability in the us and global financial markets and worldwide economies may hinder our ability to take advantage of opportunities for long term growth in our businesses 
in the event additional financing becomes necessary  we may choose to raise those funds through other means of financing as appropriate 
credit agreement we have a credit agreement with a financial institution which provides for up to million of borrowings under a revolving credit facility the revolver and a million term loan the term loan 
the revolver matures on october  with interest payable at the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
maximum borrowings under the revolver can be increased to million with the prior approval of the lender under an accordion feature 
as of december   borrowings of million and million were outstanding under the revolver and term loan  respectively  and letters of credit totaling  representing decommission funding required by the georgia department of natural resources  were outstanding under the credit agreement 
the term loan is payable in equal monthly installments of  plus interest at libor plus  through june  we intend to seek renewal or replacement of this credit agreement during the credit agreement is unsecured but provides for a lien to be established on substantially all of our assets upon certain events of default 
the credit agreement contains representations and warranties  as well as affirmative  reporting and negative covenants customary for financings of this type 
among other things  the credit agreement restricts the incurrence of certain additional debt and requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios  including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum liabilities to tangible net worth ratio  and the maintenance of minimum liquid assets of million  as all such ratios and terms are defined in the credit agreement 
we were in compliance with all covenants  as amended  as of december  we also have certain interest rate swap agreements to manage our variable interest rate exposure 
we entered into a floating to fixed rate swap with respect to the entire principal amount of the term loan  at a fixed interest rate of  and a separate floating to fixed rate swap with respect to million of the principal amount outstanding under the revolver  at a fixed interest rate of 
both interest rate swaps expire on june  our weighted average effective interest rate at december  was 
ii cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities our cash and cash equivalents include bank deposits  money market funds  us treasury securities  and commercial paper held at a limited number of financial institutions 
we review our investments in marketable securities and cash equivalents for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value  the duration of any market decline  our intent and ability to hold to maturity or expected recovery  and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
we perform research and analysis  and monitor market conditions to identify potential impairments 
looking forward  we may invest our funds in higher yielding investments if those investments meet the conservative criteria established by our investment policies and the macroeconomic outlook becomes clearer 
funds available for investment have and will continue to be utilized for our current and future expansion programs  for strategic opportunities for growth and diversification  and for installment payments on the term loan 
as funds continue to be used for these purposes  and as interest rates continue to change  we expect interest income to fluctuate accordingly 
due to the disruptions  volatility and uncertainties related to the us and global investment and credit markets we are exposed to the risk of further changes in fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities in future periods  which may cause us to take impairment charges that are not currently anticipated 
while we will continue to research  analyze and monitor our investments  we cannot predict what the effect of current investment and credit market circumstances might have on our portfolio going forward 
medicare developments prior to  medicare provided reimbursement for brachytherapy seeds under the charges adjusted to costs methodology  which is based on the actual invoiced cost of the seeds and which we sometimes refer to as a pass through methodology 
cms published a final hospital opps on november  with fixed prospective payment rates for brachytherapy seeds 
this fixed opps  which we sometimes refer to as fixed reimbursement  went in effect on january  and fixes the per seed rate at which medicare reimburses hospitals for the purchase of seeds 
under the fixed opps  cms establishes the fixed per seed rate on an annual basis 
we continue to support efforts that urge congress and cms to replace this fixed reimbursement rule by returning to the pass through reimbursement policies which existed prior to fixed reimbursement policies at cms can be expected to lead to pricing pressure from hospitals and other healthcare providers  and to have an adverse effect on our brachytherapy revenue 
the extent of the effect is impossible for us to predict  especially when fixed reimbursement policies coincide with competition from competing technologies for the treatment of early stage prostate cancer  which enjoy favorable cms reimbursement rates even though these are less proven technologies and uncertainties regarding the implementation and impact of healthcare reform generally 
in august  the budget control act of was enacted into law to increase the federal debt ceiling 
the law provided for spending cuts of nearly trillion over the next years  including proposed cuts to medicare providers 
the law further created a congressional committee that was given a deadline of november  to develop recommendations for further reducing the federal deficit by another trillion over years 
the committee was unable to agree on a plan by the november deadline  and as a result  automatic spending cuts  including a likely cut to medicare providers  will become effective beginning in medicaid is exempted from the automatic cuts 
any cuts to medicare reimbursement which affect our products could have a material adverse effect on our business and or our results of operations 
other regulatory developments in march  significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted in the form of the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca 
the ppaca includes provisions that  among other things  reduce and or limit medicare reimbursement to certain providers  require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose new and or increased taxes 
specifically  the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a excise tax on us sales of most medical devices beginning in regulations implementing the tax have been proposed  but not finalized 
in addition  some members of congress are working to repeal the tax 
while we continue to evaluate the impact of this tax on our overall business  if this tax was applicable to all of our product sales this would have equated to an excise tax of approximately million in various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level 
the ppaca and these proposals could reduce medical procedure volumes and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products 
in addition  the excise tax will increase our cost of doing business 
the impact of the ppaca and these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business and or results of operations 
on december   cms published proposed regulations that would implement provisions in ppaca related to disclosure of payments made by manufacturers to physicians and teaching hospitals 
because we manufacture a number of devices that are covered by the regulations  all payments that we make to physicians and teaching hospitals would be subject to this reporting requirement even if the payment relates to a device that is not considered a covered device 
cms has accepted public comments on the proposed regulations and will publish final regulations at some point in the future 
the tracking and reporting of these payments could have an adverse impact on our business and or results of operations and on our relationships with customers and potential customers

this unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited information presented elsewhere in this form k  reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal  recurring adjustments which are  in our opinion  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods covered and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have exposure to market risk as a result of changing interest rates on a portion of our borrowings under our credit agreement 
we have outstanding borrowings of million under our credit agreement in the form of a term loan that is payable in equal monthly installments of approximately  plus interest through june  interest is payable at libor plus 
we have entered into a floating to fixed rate swap agreement that expires june  with respect to the outstanding amount of the term loan at a fixed interest rate of 
we also have outstanding borrowings of million under the revolver component of our credit agreement 
the revolver matures in october interest on outstanding borrowings under the revolver is payable at libor plus 
we entered into a separate floating to fixed rate swap that expires june  with respect to million of the principal amount outstanding under the revolver at a fixed interest rate of 
accordingly  we are exposed to changes in interest rates on outstanding borrowings in excess of million under our revolver 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate applicable to the borrowings in excess of million would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of  per year before income taxes  assuming the same level of borrowings 
ii we review our investments in marketable securities and cash equivalents for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value  the duration of any market decline  our intent and ability to hold to maturity or expected recovery  and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
we perform research and analysis  and monitor market conditions to identify potential impairments 
due to the uncertainties related to the us and global investment and credit markets we are exposed to the risk of further changes in fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities in future periods  which may cause us to take impairment charges that are not currently anticipated 
while we will continue to research  analyze and monitor our investments  we cannot predict what the effect of current investment and credit market circumstances might have on our portfolio going forward 
our credit agreement expires on october  continued disruption in us and global markets could adversely affect our ability to renew or replace this credit agreement  and any new or replacement agreement may not be as favorable as the current credit agreement 
the negative impact of recent and continuing adverse changes in the economy and credit markets generally or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms  if at all  may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business
