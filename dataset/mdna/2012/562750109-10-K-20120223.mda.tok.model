business overview we are a leading developer and implementer of supply chain software solutions that help organizations optimize their supply chain operations from planning through execution 
our platform based supply chain software solution portfolios manhattan scope and manhattan scale tm are designed to deliver both business agility and total cost of ownership advantages to customers 
manhattan scope supply chain optimization  planning through execution leverages our supply chain process platform scpp to unify the full breadth of the supply chain  while manhattan scale supply chain architected for logistics execution leverages microsoft s 
net platform to unify logistics functions 
early in the company s history  our offerings were heavily focused on warehouse management solutions 
as the company grew in size and scope  our offerings expanded across the entire supply chain  while still maintaining a significant presence in  and a relatively strong concentration of revenues from warehouse management solutions  which is a component of our distribution management solution suite 
over time  as our non warehouse management solutions have proliferated and increased in capability  the company s revenue concentration in its warehouse management solutions has correspondingly decreased 
our business model is singularly focused on the development and implementation of complex supply chain software solutions that are designed to optimize supply chain effectiveness and efficiency for our customers 
we have three principal sources of revenue licenses of our supply chain software  professional services  including solutions planning and implementation  related consulting  customer training  and customer support services and software enhancements collectively  services  and hardware sales and other revenue 
in  we generated million in total revenue  with a revenue mix of license revenue  services revenue  and hardware and other revenue 
we manage our business based on three geographic regions north america and latin america americas  europe  middle east  and africa emea  and asia pacific apac 
geographic revenue is based on the location of the sale 
our international revenue was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  which represents approximately   and of our total revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
international revenue includes all revenue derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
at december   we employed approximately  employees worldwide  of which  employees are based in the americas  employees in emea  and employees in apac including india 
we have offices in australia  china  france  india  japan  the netherlands  singapore  and the united kingdom  as well as representatives in mexico and reseller partnerships in latin america  eastern europe  the middle east  south africa  and asia 
global economic trends and industry factors global macro economic trends  technology spending  and supply chain management market growth are important barometers for our business 
in  approximately of our total revenue was generated in the united states  in emea and the balance in apac  canada  and latin america 
in addition  industry analysts estimate that approximately two thirds of every supply chain software solutions dollar invested is spent in the united states  consequently  the health of the us economy has a meaningful impact on our financial results 

table of contents we sell technology based solutions with total pricing  including software and services  in many cases exceeding million 
our software often is a part of our customers and prospects much larger capital commitment by our customer associated with facilities expansion and business improvement 
we believe that  given the lingering uncertainty in the global macro environment  the current sales cycles for large license deals of million or greater in our target markets have been extended 
the current business climate within the united states and geographic regions in which we operate continues to affect customers and prospects decisions regarding timing of strategic capital expenditures 
delays with respect to such decisions can have a material adverse impact on our business  and may further intensify competition in our already highly competitive markets 
in january  the international monetary fund imf provided a world economic outlook weo update lowering its previous world economic growth forecast from september the update noted that  global output is projected to expand by percent in a downward revision of about percentage point relative to the september world economic outlook 
this is largely because the euro area economy is now expected to go into a mild recession in as a result of the rise in sovereign yields  the effects of bank deleveraging on the real economy  and the impact of additional fiscal consolidation 
growth in emerging and developing economies is also expected to slow because of the worsening external environment and a weakening of internal demand 
advanced economies  which represent our primary revenue markets  are projected to expand by percent on average during and as the weo further noted  given the depth of the recession  these growth rates are expected to be too sluggish to make a major impact in high unemployment 
during and  the overall trend has been an increase in large license deals for the company  with recognized million or larger software license deals totaling thirteen and nine for and  respectively  up from five in however  the large deal flow has been inconsistent from quarter to quarter  reflecting what we believe to be ongoing macro economic uncertainty in the united states and western europe 
while we are encouraged by our and results  we  along with many of our customers  still remain cautious regarding the pace of global economic recovery 
with global gdp growth continuing to be well below pre levels  we believe global economic volatility likely will continue to shape customers and prospects buying decisions  making it more difficult to forecast sales cycles for our products and the timing of large software license deals 
when reviewing our results compared to  it is important to highlight temporary expense actions instituted in to offset the impact of the global economic crisis on our revenue 
during we had no annual merit salary increases  our executives and board of directors absorbed a salary reduction  we asked many of our employees to take unpaid furlough days  and we dramatically reduced many other expenses to help offset a revenue decline versus moreover  due to poor financial results  incentive compensation was significantly reduced 
in  we reported total revenue of million for the full year  a decline in total revenue compared with full year without sacrificing investment in innovation  our aggressive measures to reduce costs enabled us to achieve million in operating profit in  with positive operating margins of 
for  salaries were restored for executives and board of directors to pre reduction levels  unpaid furlough days were eliminated  and merit increases were provided to our employees  among other actions  to ensure long term success 
revenue license revenue license revenue  a leading indicator of our business  is primarily derived from software license fees that customers pay for supply chain solutions 
in  license revenue totaled million  or of total revenue  with gross margins of 
for the year ended december   americas  emea  and apac recognized million  million  and million in license revenue  respectively 
our annual license revenue percentage mix of new versus existing customers was approximately  and over the past three years has averaged about we believe our mix of new customer to existing customer license sales is well balanced  reflecting solid demand from our install base and net new customers in a tough macro economic environment 
license revenue growth is influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions and the competitive position of our software products 
our license revenue generally has long sales cycles of which the timing of the closing of a few large license transactions can have a material impact on our quarterly license revenues  operating profit  operating margins and earnings per share 
for example  million of license revenue in equates to approximately three cents of diluted earnings per share impact 
our software solutions are singularly focused on the supply chain planning and execution markets  which are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change 
we are a market leader in the supply chain management software 
table of contents solutions market as defined by industry analysts such as arc and gartner 
our goal is to extend our position as a leading global supply chain solutions provider by growing our license revenues faster than our competitors through investment in innovation 
we expect to continue to face increased competition from erp and supply chain applications vendors and business application software vendors that may broaden their solution offerings by internally developing or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of supply chain planning and execution software 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share 
services revenue our services business consists of professional services consulting and customer training and customer support services and software enhancements 
in  our services revenue totaled million  or of total revenue  with gross margins of 
the americas  emea  and apac recognized million  million  and million  respectively  in services revenue for the year ended december  professional services accounted for approximately of total services revenue and approximately of total revenue in when comparing our operating margins to other technology companies  our consolidated operating margin profile can be lower due to our large services revenue mix as a percentage of total revenue 
while we believe our services margins are very strong  they do lower our overall operating margin as services margins are lower than license revenue margins 
at december   our professional services organization totaled approximately  employees  accounting for of our total employees worldwide 
our professional services organization provides our customers with expertise and assistance in planning and implementing our solutions 
to ensure a successful product implementation  consultants assist customers with the initial installation of a system  the conversion and transfer of the customer s historical data onto our system  and ongoing training  education  and system upgrades 
we believe our professional services enable customers to implement our software rapidly  ensure the customer s success with our solution  strengthen our customer relationships  and add to our industry specific knowledge base for use in future implementations and product innovations 
although our consulting services are optional  the majority of our customers use at least some portion of these services for the implementation and ongoing support of our software solutions 
consulting services are typically rendered under time and materials contracts with services typically billed on an hourly basis 
professional services are sometimes rendered under fixed fee contracts with payments due on specific dates or milestones 
typically  our consulting services lag license revenue by several quarters  as implementation services are performed after the purchase of the software 
services revenue growth is contingent upon license revenue growth  which is influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions and the competitive position of our software products 
in addition  our consulting services business has competitive exposure to offshore providers and other consulting companies 
all of these factors create the risk of pricing pressure  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share 
for customer support services and software enhancements csse  we offer a comprehensive program that provides our customers with software upgrades when and if available that offer additional or improved functionality and technological advances incorporating emerging supply chain and industry initiatives 
we offer hour customer support every day of the year plus software upgrades for an annual fee paid in advance 
our csse revenues totaled million in  representing approximately of services revenue and approximately of total revenue  respectively 
the growth of csse revenues is influenced by new license revenue growth  annual renewal of support contracts  increase in customers through acquisitions  and fluctuations in currency rates 
substantially all of our customers renew their annual support contracts 
over the last three years  our annual revenue renewal rate of customers subscribing to comprehensive support and enhancements has been greater than 
csse revenue is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  typically months 
csse renewal revenue is not recognized unless payment is received from the customer 
hardware and other revenue our hardware and other revenue totaled million in representing of total revenue with gross margins of 
during  americas  emea  and apac were responsible for million  million  and million  respectively  in hardware and other revenue 
in conjunction with the licensing of our software  and as a convenience for our customers  we resell a variety of hardware products developed and manufactured by third parties 
these products include computer hardware  radio frequency terminal networks  rfid chip readers  bar code printers and scanners  and other peripherals 
we resell all third party hardware products pursuant to agreements with manufacturers or through distributor authorized reseller agreements pursuant to which we are entitled to purchase hardware products at discount prices and to receive technical support in connection with product installations and any subsequent product malfunctions 
we generally purchase hardware from our vendors only after receiving an order from a customer 
as a result  we do not maintain hardware inventory 

table of contents other revenue represents amounts associated with professional services travel expense reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses 
the total amount of expense reimbursement recorded to hardware and other revenue was million   million and million for   and  respectively 
product development we intend to continue to invest significantly in research and development r d  which historically has averaged about cents of every revenue dollar  excluding hardware and other revenue  to provide market leading solutions that help global manufacturers  wholesalers  distributors  retailers and logistics providers successfully manage accelerating and fluctuating demands as well as the increasing complexity and volatility of their local and global supply chains 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
at december   our r d organization totaled approximately employees  located in the us and india  representing approximately of our total employees worldwide 
we will continue to focus our r d resources on the development and enhancement of supply chain software solutions 
we offer what we believe to be the broadest solution portfolio in the supply chain solutions marketplace  to address all aspects of planning and forecasting  inventory optimization  order lifecycle management  transportation lifecycle management  and distribution management 
we also plan to continue to provide enhancements to existing solutions and to introduce new solutions to address evolving industry standards and market needs 
we identify further enhancements to existing solutions and opportunities for new solutions through our customer support organization  as well as through ongoing customer consulting engagements and implementations  interactions with our user groups  association with leading industry analysts and market research firms  and participation on industry standards and research committees 
our solutions address the needs of customers in various vertical markets  including retail  consumer goods  food and grocery  logistics service providers  industrial and wholesale  high technology and electronics  life sciences  and government 
cash flow and financial condition for  we generated cash flow from operating activities of million and have generated a cumulative total of million for the three years ended december  our cash and investments at december  totaled million  with no debt on our balance sheet 
we currently have no credit facilities 
during the past three years  our primary uses of cash have been funding investment in r d and operations to drive earnings growth and to repurchase common stock 
during  we repurchased approximately million of manhattan associates outstanding common stock under the share repurchase program approved by our board of directors throughout the year 
in january  our board of directors approved raising our remaining share repurchase authority to million 
in  we anticipate that our priorities for use of cash will be similar to prior years  with our first priority being continued investment in product development and profitably growing our business to extend our market leadership 
we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our product footprint and technology direction 
we will also continue to weigh our share repurchase options against cash for acquisitions and investing in the business 
we do not anticipate any borrowing requirements in for general corporate purposes 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we believe that estimates  judgments  and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that 
table of contents these estimates  judgments  and assumptions are made 
to the extent there are material differences between those estimates  judgments  or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments  and assumptions are revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill  accounting for income taxes  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition the company s revenue consists of fees from the licensing and hosting of software collectively included in software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income  fees from implementation and training services collectively  professional services and customer support services and software enhancements collectively included in services revenue in the consolidated statements of income  and sales of hardware and other revenue other revenue consists of reimbursements of out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with our professional services collectively included in hardware and other revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
all revenue is recognized net of any related sales taxes 
the company recognizes license revenue when the following criteria are met a signed contract is obtained  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
revenue recognition for software with multiple element arrangements requires recognition of revenue using the residual method when a there is vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement that is not accounted for using long term contract accounting  b vsoe of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  and c all other applicable revenue recognition criteria for software revenue recognition  are satisfied 
for those contracts that contain significant customization or modifications  license revenue is recognized using contract accounting 
the company allocates revenue to customer support services and software enhancements and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vsoe of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the balance of the revenue  net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement  is recognized at the outset of the arrangement using the residual method as the product licenses are delivered 
if the company cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on the vsoe of fair value  the company defers revenue recognition until all elements are delivered  all services have been performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined 
the company must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the vsoe of fair value for each element  considering the price charged for each product on a stand alone basis or applicable renewal rates 
for arrangements that include future software functionality deliverables  the company accounts for these deliverables as a separate element of the arrangement 
because the company does not sell these deliverables on a standalone basis  the company is not able to establish vsoe of fair value of these deliverables 
as a result  the company defers all revenue under the arrangement until the future functionality has been delivered to the customer 
payment terms for the company s software licenses vary 
each contract is evaluated individually to determine whether the fees in the contract are fixed and determinable and whether collection is probable 
judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience  and economic market conditions 
if market conditions decline  or if the financial conditions of customers deteriorate  the company may be unable to determine that collection is probable  and the company could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the company receives customer payments 
the company has an established history of collecting under the terms of its software license contracts without providing refunds or concessions to its customers 
therefore  the company has determined that the presence of payment terms which extend beyond contract execution in a particular contract do not preclude the conclusion that the fees in the contract are fixed and determinable 
although infrequent  when payment terms in a contract extend beyond twelve months  the company has determined that such fees are not fixed and determinable and recognizes revenue as payments become due provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
the company s services revenue consists of fees generated from professional services and customer support services and software enhancements related to the company s software products 
fees from professional services performed by the company are generally billed on an hourly basis  and revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
in certain situations  professional services are rendered under agreements in which billings are limited to contractual maximums or based upon a fixed fee for portions of or all of the engagement 
revenue related to fixed fee contracts is recognized on a proportional performance basis based on the hours incurred on discrete projects within an overall services arrangement 
the company has determined that output measures  or services delivered  approximate the input measures associated with fixed fee services arrangements 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period in which they become known 
revenue related to customer support services and software enhancements is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  typically twelve months 

table of contents hardware and other revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware products  developed and manufactured by third parties  that are integrated with and complementary to the company s software solutions 
as part of a complete solution  the company s customers periodically purchase hardware from the company for use with the software licenses purchased from the company 
these products include computer hardware  radio frequency terminal networks  rfid chip readers  bar code printers and scanners  and other peripherals 
hardware revenue is recognized upon shipment to the customer when title passes 
the company generally purchases hardware from the company s vendors only after receiving an order from a customer 
as a result  the company does not maintain hardware inventory 
in accordance with the other presentation matters within the revenue recognition topic of the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification  the company recognizes amounts associated with reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenue 
such amounts have been classified as hardware and other revenue 
the total amount of expense reimbursement recorded to revenue was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts generally represent a sales allowance on services revenue  which are recorded to operations as a reduction to services revenue 
while such losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the fasb accounting standards codification  we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
our goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test  which requires us to estimate the fair value of our business compared to the carrying value 
the impairment reviews require an analysis of future projections and assumptions about our operating performance 
should such review indicate the assets are impaired  we would record an expense for the impaired assets 
annual tests or other future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our goodwill is impaired 
for example  if we had reason to believe that our recorded goodwill had become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying business  we would have to record a charge to income for that portion of goodwill that we believed was impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
at december   our goodwill balance was million 
accounting for income taxes we provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb accounting standards codification 
under this accounting pronouncement  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities resulting from events that are recorded for financial reporting purposes in a different reporting period than recorded in the tax return 
management must make significant assumptions  judgments  and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  allowable deductions  projected tax credits  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position 
if the recognition threshold is met  we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than percent likely to be realized 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations 
our assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments  and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents stock based compensation in january our compensation committee approved certain changes to our historical equity incentive grant practices  with the objective to optimize the company s performance and retention strength while managing program share usage to improve long term equity overhang 
the change eliminated stock option awards in favor of restricted stock grants  which for the and awards contain vesting provisions that are service based and performance based 
the and awards have a four year vesting period  with the performance portion tied to their respective year revenue and adjusted earnings per share targets 
for our historical stock option grants  we estimated the fair value on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
we based our estimate of fair value on certain assumptions  including the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of the price of the underlying share for the expected term of the option  the expected dividends on the underlying share for the expected term  and the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option 
we based our expected volatilities on a combination of the historical volatility of our stock and the implied volatility of publicly traded options issued by third party for our common stock 
due to the limited trading volume of publicly traded options for our common stock  we placed a greater emphasis on historical volatility of our common stock 
we also used historical data to estimate the term that options are expected to be outstanding 
we based the risk free interest rate on the rate for us treasury zero coupon issues with a term approximating the expected term 
we recognize compensation cost for service based awards with graded vesting on a straight line basis over the entire vesting period  with the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date at least equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award that is vested at that date 
for our performance based restricted stock awards with graded vesting  we recognize compensation cost on an accelerated basis applying straight line expensing for each separately vesting portion of each award 
compensation cost recognized in any period is impacted by the number of stock based awards granted  the vesting period of the awards which generally is four years  the estimated forfeiture rate  and the probable outcome of any performance conditions 
accounting charges recovery of previously impaired investment 
during the quarter ended september   we recorded an impairment charge of million on an investment in an auction rate security

we will also continue to weigh our share repurchase options against cash for acquisitions and investing in the business 
we do not anticipate any borrowing requirements in for general corporate purposes 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued an accounting standards update on testing goodwill for impairment to simplify the goodwill impairment test 
the standard update is intended to reduce cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by permitting companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
under this standard update  a company is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the company determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed for the fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued an accounting standards update which was subsequently updated in december on the presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance requires the presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance also requires presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of other comprehensive income are presented or in the notes to the financial statements 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   however  early adoption was permitted 
we have elected to adopt this guidance as of december  the adoption of this guidance only impacted the presentation of our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued an accounting standards update on fair value measurements that clarifies the application of existing guidance and disclosure requirements  changes certain fair value measurement principles  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements

the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  in thousands total thereafter non cancelable operating leases indemnifications our customer contracts generally contain infringement indemnity provisions 
under those provisions  we generally agree  subject to certain exceptions  to indemnify  defend  and hold harmless the customer in connection with third party claims against the customer alleging that the customer s use of our software products in compliance with their license infringe the third party s patent  copyright  or other intellectual property rights 
conditions to our obligations generally include that we are provided the right to control the defense of the claims and  in general  to control settlement negotiations 
those provisions generally provide also that  if the customer is prevented from using our software because of a third party infringement claim  our sole obligation in addition to the indemnification  defense  and hold harmless obligation referred to above is to  at our expense  i procure for the customer the right to continue to use the software  ii to replace or modify the product so that its use by the customer does not infringe  or  if either of the foregoing are not reasonably feasible  to terminate the customer contract and provide a refund of the unamortized portion of the customer s license fee based on a five year amortization period 
our customer contracts sometimes also require us to indemnify  defend  and hold harmless the customer in connection with death  personal injury  or property damage claims made by third parties with respect to actions of our personnel or contractors 
conditions to our obligations generally include that we are provided the right to control the defense of the claims and  in general  to control settlement negotiations 
the indemnity obligations contained in our customer contracts generally have no specified expiration date and no specified monetary limitation on liability 
we have not previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification obligations 
we account for these indemnity obligations in accordance with fasb guidance on accounting for contingencies  and record a liability for these obligations when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
we have not recorded any liabilities for these contracts as of december  warranties in general  in our customer contracts we warrant to our customers that our software products will perform in all material respects in accordance with our standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery of the licensed products to the 
table of contents customer for six months after first use of the licensed products  but no more than months after execution of the license agreement 
additionally  we warrant to our customers that our services will be performed consistent with generally accepted industry standards or specific service levels through completion of the agreed upon services 
if necessary  we would provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty claims and claim history 
however  we have not incurred significant recurring expense under our product or service warranties 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is nominal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign business our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
our international operations currently include business activity out of offices in the united kingdom  the netherlands  france  australia  china  japan  singapore  and india 
when the us dollar strengthens against a foreign currency  the value of our sales and expenses in that currency converted to us dollars decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the value of our sales and expenses in that currency converted to us dollars increases 
we recognized a foreign exchange gain of million in and foreign exchange losses of million and million in and  respectively 
foreign exchange rate transaction gains and losses are classified in other income loss  net in our consolidated statements of income 
a fluctuation of in the period end exchange rates at december  relative to the us dollar would result in minimal change to the reported foreign currency gain and a fluctuation of in the period end exchange rates at december  relative to the us dollar would result in a change of approximately million in the reported foreign currency loss 
interest rates we currently invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including taxable and tax advantaged floating rate obligations in money market funds and certificates of deposit 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are derived from business operations 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents  and investment balances totaled million  of which million is highly liquid 
the remaining investments totaling million are invested in short term certificates of deposit and auction rate securities that were purchased prior to our cash equivalents balance at december  was million 
cash equivalents principally consist of highly liquid money market funds and certificates of deposit with maturities of less than three months when purchased 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate of return on cash and investment securities was approximately and approximately for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the fair value of cash equivalents and investments held at december  and was million and million  respectively 
based on the average investments outstanding during and  increases or decreases in the rate of return of basis points would result in increases or decreases to interest income of approximately million for both years and  from the reported interest income
