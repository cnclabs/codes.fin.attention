adjustments we have adjusted all applicable share and per share amounts to reflect the retroactive effects of the three for two stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was effective may  overview molina healthcare  inc provides quality and cost effective medicaid related solutions to meet the health care needs of low income families and individuals  and to assist state agencies in their administration of the medicaid program 
our business comprises our health plans segment  consisting of licensed health maintenance organizations serving medicaid populations in ten states  and our molina medicaid solutions segment  which provides design  development  implementation  and business process outsourcing solutions to medicaid agencies in an additional five states 
we also have a direct delivery business that currently consists of primary care community clinics in california and washington  additionally  we manage three county owned primary care clinics under a contract with fairfax county  virginia 
we report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments health plans  and molina medicaid solutions 
our health plans segment comprises health plans in california  florida  michigan  missouri  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  washington  and wisconsin  and includes our direct delivery business 
this segment served approximately million members eligible for medicaid  medicare  and other government sponsored health care programs for low income families and individuals as of december  the health plans are operated by our respective wholly owned subsidiaries in those states  each of which is licensed as a health maintenance organization  or hmo 
on february   the division of purchasing of the missouri office of administration notified us that our missouri health plan was not awarded a contract under the missouri healthnet managed care request for proposal  therefore  our missouri health plan s existing contract with the state will expire without renewal on june  in connection with this notification  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately million  or per diluted share 
most of the impairment charge is not tax deductible  resulting in a disproportionate impact to net income 
for the year ended december   our missouri health plan contributed premium revenue of million  or of total premium revenue  and comprised  members  or of total health plans segment membership 
on may   we acquired a health information management business which we operate under the name  molina medicaid solutions 
our molina medicaid solutions segment provides design  development  implementation  and business process outsourcing solutions to state governments for their medicaid management information systems  or mmis 
mmis is a core tool used to support the administration of state medicaid and other health care entitlement programs 
molina medicaid solutions currently holds mmis contracts with the states of idaho  louisiana  maine  new jersey  and west virginia  as well as a contract to provide drug rebate administration services for the florida medicaid program 
on june   molina medicaid solutions received notice from the state of louisiana that the state intends to award the contract for a replacement medicaid management information system  or mmis  to another firm 
our revenue under the louisiana mmis contract from may   the date we acquired molina medicaid solutions  through december   was approximately million 
for the year ended december   our revenue under the louisiana mmis contract was approximately million 
we expect that we will continue to perform under this contract through implementation and acceptance of the successor mmis 
based upon our past experience and our knowledge of the louisiana mmis bid process  we believe that implementation and acceptance of the successor mmis will not occur until at the earliest 
through implementation and acceptance of the successor mmis we expect to recognize between million and million in revenue annually under our louisiana mmis contract 

table of contents composition of revenue and membership health plans segment our health plans segment derives its revenue  in the form of premiums  chiefly from medicaid contracts with the states in which our health plans operate 
premium revenue is fixed in advance of the periods covered and  except as described in critical accounting policies below  is not generally subject to significant accounting estimates 
for the year ended december   we received approximately of our premium revenue as a fixed amount per member per month  or pmpm  pursuant to our medicaid contracts with state agencies  our medicare contracts with the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  and our contracts with other managed care organizations for which we operate as a subcontractor 
these premium revenues are recognized in the month that members are entitled to receive health care services 
the state medicaid programs and the federal medicare program periodically adjust premium rates 
for the year ended december   we received approximately of our premium revenue in the form of birth income a one time payment for the delivery of a child from the medicaid programs in all of our state health plans except new mexico 
such payments are recognized as revenue in the month the birth occurs 
the amount of the premiums paid to us may vary substantially between states and among various government programs 
premiums pmpm for the children s health insurance program  or chip  members are generally among our lowest  with rates as low as approximately pmpm in california 
premium revenues for medicaid members are generally higher 
among the temporary assistance for needy families  or tanf  medicaid population the medicaid group that includes mostly mothers and children pmpm premiums range between approximately in california to in missouri 
among our medicaid aged  blind or disabled  or abd  membership  pmpm premiums range from approximately in utah to  in ohio 
contributing to the variability in medicaid rates among the states is the practice of some states to exclude certain benefits from the managed care contract most often pharmacy  inpatient  behavioral health and catastrophic case benefits and retain responsibility for those benefits at the state level 
medicare membership generates the highest average pmpm premiums  at approximately  pmpm 
the following table sets forth the approximate total number of members by state health plan as of the dates indicated september  september  september  as of december  total ending membership by health plan california florida michigan missouri new mexico ohio texas utah washington wisconsin total total ending membership by state for our medicare advantage plans california florida michigan new mexico ohio texas utah washington total 
table of contents september  september  september  as of december  total ending membership by state for our aged  blind or disabled population california florida michigan new mexico ohio texas utah washington wisconsin total we acquired the wisconsin health plan on september  as of december   the wisconsin health plan had approximately  medicare advantage members covered under a reinsurance contract with a third party  these members are not included in the membership tables herein 
molina medicaid solutions segment the payments received by our molina medicaid solutions segment under its state contracts are based on the performance of multiple services 
the first of these is the design  development and implementation  or ddi  of a medicaid management information system  or mmis 
an additional service  following completion of ddi  is the operation of the mmis under a business process outsourcing  or bpo arrangement 
while providing bpo services which include claims payment and eligibility processing we also provide the state with other services including both hosting and support and maintenance 
because we have determined the services provided under our molina medicaid solutions contracts represent a single unit of accounting  we recognize revenue associated with such contracts on a straight line basis over the period during which bpo  hosting  and support and maintenance services are delivered 
composition of expenses health plans segment operating expenses for the health plans segment include expenses related to the provision of medical care services  g a expenses  and premium tax expenses 
our results of operations are impacted by our ability to effectively manage expenses related to medical care services and to accurately estimate medical costs incurred 
expenses related to medical care services are captured in the following four categories fee for service physician providers paid on a fee for service basis are paid according to a fee schedule set by the state or by our contracts with these providers 
most hospitals are paid on a fee for service basis in a variety of ways  including per diem amounts  diagnostic related groups or drgs  percent of billed charges  and case rates 
as discussed below  we also pay a small portion of hospitals on a capitated basis 
we also have stop loss agreements with the hospitals with which we contract 
under all fee for service arrangements  we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided 
expenses related to fee for service contracts are recorded in the period in which the related services are dispensed 
the costs of drugs administered in a physician or hospital setting that are not billed through our pharmacy benefit managers are included in fee for service costs 
capitation many of our primary care physicians and a small portion of our specialists and hospitals are paid on a capitated basis 
under capitation contracts  we typically pay a fixed per member per month  or pmpm  payment to the provider without regard to the frequency  extent  or nature of the medical services actually furnished 
under capitated contracts  we remain liable for the provision of certain health care services 
certain of our capitated contracts also contain incentive programs based on service delivery  quality of care  utilization management  and other criteria 
capitation payments are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates 
these payments are expensed in the period the providers are obligated to provide services 
the financial risk for pharmacy services for a small portion of our membership is delegated to capitated providers 
pharmacy pharmacy costs include all drug  injectibles  and immunization costs paid through our pharmacy benefit managers 
as noted above  drugs and injectibles not paid through our pharmacy benefit managers are included in fee for service costs  except in those limited instances where we capitate drug and injectible costs 

table of contents other other medical care costs include medically related administrative costs  certain provider incentive costs  reinsurance cost  and other health care expense 
medically related administrative costs include  for example  expenses relating to health education  quality assurance  case management  disease management  hour on call nurses  and a portion of our information technology costs 
salary and benefit costs are a substantial portion of these expenses 
for the years ended december    and  medically related administrative costs were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
our medical care costs include amounts that have been paid by us through the reporting date as well as estimated liabilities for medical care costs incurred but not paid by us as of the reporting date 
see critical accounting policies below for a comprehensive discussion of how we estimate such liabilities 
molina medicaid solutions segment cost of service revenue consists primarily of the costs incurred to provide business process outsourcing and technology outsourcing services under our contracts in idaho  louisiana  maine  new jersey  west virginia  and florida 
general and administrative costs consist primarily of indirect administrative costs and business development costs 
in some circumstances we may defer recognition of incremental direct costs such as direct labor  hardware  and software associated with a contract if revenue recognition is also deferred 
such deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining original contract term  consistent with the revenue recognition period 
we began to recognize deferred contract costs for our maine contract in september  at the same time we began to recognize revenue associated with that contract 
in idaho  we expect to begin recognition of deferred contract costs in  in a manner consistent with our anticipated recognition of revenue 
financial performance summary the following table and narrative briefly summarizes our financial and operating performance for the years ended december    and all ratios  with the exception of the medical care ratio and the premium tax ratio  are shown as a percentage of total revenue 
the medical care ratio and the premium tax ratio are computed as a percentage of premium revenue because there are direct relationships between premium revenue earned  and the cost of health care and premium taxes

meanwhile  we achieved a medical care ratio of  compared with a medical care ratio of for fiscal year we have continued to lay the foundation for further growth  achieving certification of our medicaid management information system in maine  winning large contract awards in texas  serving more of the abd population in california  and preparing to serve dual eligible members in many of our states 
during  we continued to pursue the expansion of our health plans segment  membership grew on a member month basis over we have expanded our growing presence in texas  where new contracts in and have led to the addition of approximately  members in  which includes nearly  new abd members 
this membership growth not only provides increased scale for leveraging our resources in texas  it makes us an increasingly important player in a state where the potential revenue opportunity will grow as new medicaid beneficiaries qualify for coverage under health care reform 
our texas and wisconsin health plans continue to face challenges 
we have undertaken a number of measures focused on both utilization and unit cost reductions to improve the profitability of these health plans 
we remain concerned about state budget deficits  which are not expected to improve in accordingly  the rate environment for our health plans remains uncertain  and we have received several rate reductions in  including a reduction in new mexico effective july   a reduction in utah effective july   a rate reduction in texas effective september   and a reduction in california effective october  additionally  we have received a proposed rate reduction in california that we believe will translate into a premium reduction of approximately retroactive to july  however  we have also received rate increases  including a rate increase at our missouri health plan effective july   a rate increase at our florida plan effective september   and a rate increase at our michigan plan effective october  with respect to our molina medicaid solutions business  our mmis in maine received full certification from cms in december the state of idaho has sent their formal request for system certification to cms  and we anticipate certification review in early  with formal certification in the second half of health plans segment premium revenue in the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   premium revenue increased due to a membership increase of approximately on a member month basis  and pmpm revenue increase of approximately 
premium revenues were impacted by the following in in the fourth quarter of  our new mexico health plan entered into a contract amendment that more closely aligns the calculation of revenue with the methodology adopted under the affordable care act 
the contract amendment changed the calculation of the amount of revenue that may be recognized relative to medical costs  and resulted in the recognition of approximately million of premium revenue which all related to periods prior to also in the fourth quarter of  the addition of pharmacy benefits at our ohio health plan effective october   increased premium revenue 
absent the adjustment to new mexico premium revenue and the addition of the pharmacy benefit in ohio  premium revenue pmpm increased approximately  from in to in increased enrollment among the abd and medicare populations contributed to the higher premium revenue pmpm

acquisitions molina center 
on december   our wholly owned subsidiary molina center llc closed on its acquisition of the  square foot office building located in long beach  california 
the building  or molina center  consists of two conjoined fourteen story office towers on approximately five acres of land 
for the last several years we have leased approximately  square feet of the molina center for use as our corporate headquarters and also for use by our california health plan subsidiary 
the final purchase price was million  which amount was paid with a combination of cash on hand and bank financing under a term loan agreement 
we acquired this business primarily to facilitate space needs for the projected future growth of the company 
molina medicaid solutions 
on may   we acquired a health information management business which we operate under the name  molina medicaid solutions sm as described in overview  above 
liquidity and capital resources we manage our cash  investments  and capital structure to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility 
we forecast  analyze  and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 
our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue 
such cash flows are our primary source of liquidity 
thus  any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
we generally receive premium revenue in advance of the payment of claims for the related health care services 
a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
after considering expected cash flows from operating activities  we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short term obligations in longer term  investment grade  marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return 
these investments are made pursuant to board approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations 
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital  and maximize total return on invested assets  all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest 
these investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of five years or less excluding auction rate securities and variable rate securities  for which interest rates are periodically reset and that the average maturity be two years or less 
professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments 
as of december   a substantial portion of our cash was invested in a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities  and our investments consisted solely of investment grade debt securities 
all of our investments are classified as current assets  except for our restricted investments  and our investments in auction rate securities  which are classified as non current assets 
our restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit and us treasury securities 
investment income decreased to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  our annualized portfolio yields for the years ended december    and were   and  respectively 
investments and restricted investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our restricted investments until maturity 
declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 

table of contents cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid to our non regulated parent company in the form of dividends  when and as permitted by applicable regulations  for general corporate use 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to the change in deferred revenue 
in  deferred revenue was a use of cash amounting to million  compared with million in cash provided by financing activities decreased due to million of net proceeds from our common stock offering in the third quarter of  offset by the million borrowed under a term loan used to purchase the molina center in reconciliation of non gaap to gaap financial measures ebitda september  september  year ended december  in thousands net income add back depreciation and amortization reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows interest expense provision for income taxes ebitda gaap stands for us generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda is not prepared in conformity with gaap because it excludes depreciation and amortization  as well as interest expense  and the provision for income taxes 
this non gaap financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the gaap measures of net income  operating income  operating margin  or cash provided by operating activities  nor should ebitda be considered in isolation from these gaap measures of operating performance 
management uses ebitda as a supplemental metric in evaluating our financial performance  in evaluating financing and business development decisions  and in forecasting and analyzing future periods 
for these reasons  management believes that ebitda is a useful supplemental measure to investors in evaluating our performance and the performance of other companies in our industry 
capital resources at december   the parent company molina healthcare  inc held cash and investments of approximately million  compared with approximately million of cash and investments at december  this decline was primarily due to a capital contribution to our texas health plan in the fourth quarter of and cash paid to acquire the molina center 
on a consolidated basis  at december   we had working capital of million compared with million at december  at december  we had cash and investments of million  compared with million of cash and investments at december  effective as of october   our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of million in aggregate of either our common stock or our convertible senior notes due see discussion of convertible senior notes below 
the repurchase program will be funded with working capital or draws under our credit facility see discussion of credit facility below 
on july   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to million to be used to purchase shares of our common stock under a rule b trading plan 
under this program  we purchased approximately  shares of our common stock for million average cost of approximately per share during august these purchases did not materially impact diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  subsequently  we retired the million of treasury shares purchased  which reduced additional paid in capital as of december  
table of contents we believe that our cash resources  credit facility  and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations  regulatory requirements  and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
credit facility on september   we entered into a credit agreement for a million revolving credit facility the credit facility with various lenders and us bank national association  as lc issuer  swing line lender  and administrative agent 
the credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes 
the credit facility has a term of five years under which all amounts outstanding will be due and payable on september  subject to obtaining commitments from existing or new lenders and satisfaction of other specified conditions  we may increase the credit facility to up to million 
as of december   there was no outstanding principal balance under the credit facility 
however  as of december   our lenders had issued two letters of credit in the aggregate principal amount of million as required under the molina medicaid solutions contracts with the states of maine and idaho  which reduced the amount available under the credit facility by million 
borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest based  at our election  on the base rate plus an applicable margin or the eurodollar rate 
the base rate is  for any day  a rate of interest per annum equal to the highest of i the prime rate of interest announced from time to time by us bank or its parent  ii the sum of the federal funds rate for such day plus per annum and iii the eurodollar rate without giving effect to the applicable margin for a one month interest period on such day or if such day is not a business day  the immediately preceding business day plus 
the eurodollar rate is a reserve adjusted rate at which eurodollar deposits are offered in the interbank eurodollar market plus an applicable margin 
in addition to interest payable on the principal amount of indebtedness outstanding from time to time under the credit facility  we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of to based upon our leverage ratio of the unused amount of the lenders commitments under the credit facility 
the initial commitment fee shall be set at until our delivery of its financials for the year ended december  the applicable margins range between to for base rate loans and to for eurodollar loans  in each case  based upon our leverage ratio 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets  with the exception of certain of our real estate assets  and by a pledge of the capital stock or membership interests of our operating subsidiaries and health plans with the exception of the california health plan 
the credit facility includes usual and customary covenants for credit facilities of this type  including covenants limiting liens  mergers  asset sales  other fundamental changes  debt  acquisitions  dividends and other distributions  capital expenditures  and investments 
the credit facility also requires us to maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to total consolidated ebitda of not more than to as of the end of each fiscal quarter and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit facility 
in the event of a default  including cross defaults relating to specified other debt in excess of million  the lenders may terminate the commitments under the credit facility and declare the amounts outstanding  including all accrued interest and unpaid fees  payable immediately 
in addition  the lenders may enforce any and all rights and remedies created under the credit facility or applicable law 
in connection with our entrance into the credit facility  on september   we terminated our existing credit agreement with bank of america  dated march   as amended to date  which had provided us with a million revolving credit facility 
convertible senior notes as of december   million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due the notes were outstanding 
the notes rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future senior indebtedness 
the notes are convertible into cash and  under certain circumstances  shares of our common stock 
the initial conversion rate is shares of our common stock per  principal amount of the notes 
this represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share of our common stock 
in addition  if certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control occur prior to maturity  we will increase the conversion rate in certain circumstances 

table of contents term loan on december   our wholly owned subsidiary  molina center llc  entered into a term loan agreement  dated as of december   with various lenders and east west bank  as administrative agent the administrative agent 
pursuant to the terms of the term loan agreement  molina center llc borrowed the aggregate principal amount of million to finance a portion of the million purchase price for the acquisition of the approximately  square foot office building  now named molina center  located in long beach  california 
the outstanding principal amount under the term loan agreement bears interest at the rate of per annum from the date of the closing of the loan through december   and at the eurodollar rate for each interest period as defined below commencing january  the eurodollar rate is a per annum rate of interest equal to the greater of a the rate that is published in the wall street journal as the london interbank offered rate for deposits in united states dollars  for a period of one month  two business days prior to the commencement of an interest period  multiplied by a statutory reserve rate established by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  or b 
the loan matures on november   and is subject to a year amortization schedule that commences on january  the term loan agreement contains customary representations  warranties  and financial covenants 
in the event of a default as described in the term loan agreement  the outstanding principal amount under the term loan agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum higher than the otherwise applicable rate 
we have agreed to pay to the administrative agent a loan fee in the amount of  and an agency fee of  all amounts due under the term loan agreement and related loan documents are secured by a security interest in the molina center in favor of and for the benefit of the administrative agent and the other lenders under the term loan agreement 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our health plans are subject to state laws and regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment  and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder 
to the extent the subsidiaries must comply with these regulations  they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us 
the net assets in these subsidiaries after intercompany eliminations which may not be transferable to us in the form of loans  advances  or cash dividends was million at december   and million at december  the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  adopted rules effective december   which  if implemented by the states  set minimum capitalization requirements for insurance companies  hmos  and other entities bearing risk for health care coverage 
the requirements take the form of risk based capital  or rbc  rules 
michigan  missouri  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  washington  and wisconsin have adopted these rules  which may vary from state to state 
california and florida have not yet adopted naic risk based capital requirements for hmos and have not formally given notice of their intention to do so 
such requirements  if adopted by california and florida  may increase the minimum capital required for those states 
as of december   our health plans had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million 
all of our health plans were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements at december  we have the ability and commitment to provide additional capital to each of our health plans when necessary to ensure that statutory capital and surplus continue to meet regulatory requirements 
critical accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
our most significant accounting policies relate to health plan contractual provisions that may limit revenue based upon the costs incurred or the profits realized under a specific contract  health plan quality incentives that allow us to recognize incremental revenue if certain quality standards are met  the recognition of revenue and costs associated with contracts held by our molina medicaid solutions segment  and  the determination of medical claims and benefits payable 

table of contents revenue recognition health plans segment premium revenue is fixed in advance of the periods covered and  except as described below  is not generally subject to significant accounting estimates 
premium revenues are recognized in the month that members are entitled to receive health care services 
certain components of premium revenue are subject to accounting estimates 
the components of premium revenue subject to estimation fall into two categories contractual provisions that may limit revenue based upon the costs incurred or the profits realized under a specific contract 
these are contractual provisions that require the health plan to return premiums to the extent that certain thresholds are not met 
in some instances premiums are returned when medical costs fall below a certain percentage of gross premiums  or when administrative costs or profits exceed a certain percentage of gross premiums 
in other instances  premiums are partially determined by the acuity of care provided to members risk adjustment 
to the extent that our expenses and profits change from the amounts previously reported due to changes in estimates our revenue earned for those periods will also change 
in all of these instances our revenue is only subject to estimate due to the fact that the thresholds themselves contain elements expense or profit that are subject to estimate 
while we have adequate experience and data to make sound estimates of our expenses or profits  changes to those estimates may be necessary  which in turn will lead to changes in our estimates of revenue 
in general  a change in estimate relating to expense or profit would offset any related change in estimate to premium  resulting in no or small impact to net income 
the following contractual provisions fall into this category california health plan medical cost floors minimums a portion of certain premiums received by our california health plan may be returned to the state if certain minimum amounts are not spent on defined medical care costs 
at december   we recorded a liability of million under the terms of these contract provisions 
florida health plan medical cost floor minimum for behavioral health a portion of premiums received by our florida health plan may be returned to the state if certain minimum amounts are not spent on defined behavioral health care costs 
at december   we had not recorded any liability under the terms of this contract provision since behavioral health expenses are not less than the contractual floor 
new mexico health plan medical cost floors minimums and administrative cost and profit ceilings maximums a portion of premiums received by our new mexico health plan may be returned to the state if certain minimum amounts are not spent on defined medical care costs  or if administrative costs or profit as defined exceed certain amounts 
our contract with the state of new mexico requires that we spend a minimum percentage of premium revenue on certain explicitly defined medical care costs the medical cost floor 
the new mexico health plan contract also contains certain limits on the amount our new mexico health plan can a expend on administrative costs  and b retain as profit 
at december   we had not recorded any liability under the terms of these contract provisions 
in the fourth quarter of  our new mexico health plan entered into a contract amendment that more closely aligns the calculation of revenue with the methodology adopted under the affordable care act 
the contract amendment changed the calculation of the amount of revenue that may be recognized relative to medical costs  and resulted in the recognition of approximately million of premium revenue which all related to periods prior to texas health plan profit sharing under our contract with the state of texas  there is a profit sharing agreement under which we pay a rebate to the state of texas if our texas health plan generates pretax income  as defined in the contract  above a certain specified percentage  as determined in accordance with a tiered rebate schedule 
the rebates  if any  are calculated separately for the tanf chip and abd products 
we are limited in the amount of administrative costs that we may deduct in calculating the rebate  if any 
as a result of profits in excess of the amount we are allowed to fully retain  we had an aggregate liability of approximately million accrued pursuant to our profit sharing agreement with the state of texas at december  medicare revenue risk adjustment based on member encounter data that we submit to cms  our medicare premiums are subject to retroactive adjustment for both member risk scores and member pharmacy cost experience for up to two years after the original year of service 
this adjustment takes into account the acuity of each member s medical needs relative to what was anticipated when premiums were originally set for that member 
in the event that a member requires less acute medical care than was anticipated by the original premium amount  cms may recover premium from us 
in the event that a member 
table of contents requires more acute medical care than was anticipated by the original premium amount  cms may pay us additional retroactive premium 
a similar retroactive reconciliation is undertaken by cms for our medicare members pharmacy utilization 
we estimate the amount of medicare revenue that will ultimately be realized for the periods presented based on our knowledge of our members heath care utilization patterns and cms practices 
based on our knowledge of member health care utilization patterns and expenses we have recorded a receivable of approximately million for anticipated medicare risk adjustment premiums at december  quality incentives that allow us to recognize incremental revenue if certain quality standards are met 
these are contract provisions that allow us to earn additional premium revenue in certain states if we achieve certain quality of care or administrative measures 
we estimate the amount of revenue that will ultimately be realized for the periods presented based on our experience and expertise in meeting the quality and administrative measures as well as our ongoing and current monitoring of our progress in meeting those measures 
the amount of the revenue that we will realize under these contractual provisions is determinable based upon that experience 
the following contractual provisions fall into this category new mexico health plan quality incentive premiums under our contract with the state of new mexico  incremental revenue of up to of our total premium is earned if certain performance measures are met 
these performance measures are generally linked to various quality of care and administrative measures dictated by the state 
ohio health plan quality incentive premiums under our contract with the state of ohio  incremental revenue of up to of our total premium is earned if certain performance measures are met 
effective february  through june   we were eligible to earn additional incremental revenue of up to of our total premium if we met certain pharmacy specific performance measures 
these performance measures are generally linked to various quality of care measures dictated by the state 
texas health plan quality incentive premiums under our contract with the state of texas  incremental revenue of up to of our total premium may be earned if certain performance measures are met 
these performance measures are generally linked to various quality of care measures established by the state 
the time period for the assessment of these performance measures previously followed the state s fiscal year  but effective january   it follows the calendar year 
however  during the state of texas notified us that it had discontinued the program for the calendar year 
we anticipate that the program will be reinstituted in wisconsin health plan quality incentive premiums under our contract with the state of wisconsin  effective beginning in  up to of the premium is withheld by the state

table of contents service revenue and cost of service revenue molina medicaid solutions segment the payments received by our molina medicaid solutions segment under its state contracts are based on the performance of multiple services 
the first of these is the design  development and implementation  or ddi  of a medicaid management information system  or mmis 
an additional service  following completion of ddi  is the operation of the mmis under a business process outsourcing  or bpo arrangement 
while providing bpo services which include claims payment and eligibility processing we also provide the state with other services including both hosting and support and maintenance 
we have evaluated our molina medicaid solutions contracts to determine if such arrangements include a software element 
based on this evaluation  we have concluded that these arrangements do not include a software element 
as such  we have concluded that our molina medicaid solutions contracts are multiple element service arrangements under the scope of fasb accounting standards codification subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  and sec staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition 
effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard that amends the guidance on the accounting for multiple element arrangements 
pursuant to the new standard  each required deliverable is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting which is generally based on whether the deliverable has standalone value to the customer 
in addition to standalone value  previous guidance also required objective and reliable evidence of fair value of a deliverable in order to treat the deliverable as a separate unit of accounting 
the arrangement s consideration that is fixed or determinable is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
in general  the consideration allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized as the related goods or services are delivered  limited to the consideration that is not contingent 
we have adopted this guidance on a prospective basis for all new or materially modified revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables entered into on or after january  our adoption of this guidance has not impacted the timing or pattern of our revenue recognition in also  there would have been no change in revenue recognized relating to multiple element arrangements if we had adopted this guidance retrospectively for contracts entered into prior to january  we have concluded that the various service elements in our molina medicaid solutions contracts represent a single unit of accounting due to the fact that ddi  which is the only service performed in advance of the other services all other services are performed over an identical period  does not have standalone value because our ddi services are not sold separately by any vendor and the customer could not resell our ddi services 
further  we have no objective and reliable evidence of fair value for any of the individual elements in these contracts  and at no point in the contract will we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements in the contracts 
for contracts entered into prior to january   objective and reliable evidence of fair value would be required  in addition to ddi standalone value which we do not have  in order to treat ddi as a separate unit of accounting 
we lack objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the individual elements of our molina medicaid solutions contracts for the following reasons each contract calls for the provision of its own specific set of services 
while all contracts support the system of record for state mmis  the actual services we provide vary significantly between contracts  and the nature of the mmis installed varies significantly between our older contracts proprietary mainframe systems and our new contracts commercial off the shelf technology solutions 
because we have determined the services provided under our molina medicaid solutions contracts represent a single unit of accounting and because we are unable to determine a pattern of performance of services during the contract period  we recognize revenue associated with such contracts on a straight line basis over the period during which bpo  hosting  and support and maintenance services are delivered 
provisions specific to each contract may  however  lead us to modify this general principle 
in those circumstances  the right of the state to refuse acceptance of services  as well as the related obligation to compensate us  may require us to delay recognition of all or part of our revenue until that contingency the right of the state to refuse acceptance has been removed 
in those circumstances we defer recognition of any contingent revenue whether ddi  bpo services  hosting  and support and maintenance services until the contingency has been removed 
these types of contingency features are present in our maine and idaho contracts 
we began to recognize revenue associated with our maine contract upon state acceptance in september in idaho  we will begin recognition of revenue upon state acceptance 
costs associated with our molina medicaid solutions contracts include software related costs and other costs 
with respect to software related costs  we apply the guidance for internal use software and capitalize external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software  and payroll and payroll related costs associated with employees who are directly 
table of contents associated with and who devote time to the computer software project 
with respect to all other direct costs  such costs are expensed as incurred  unless corresponding revenue is being deferred 
if revenue is being deferred  direct costs relating to delivered service elements are deferred as well and are recognized on a straight line basis over the period of revenue recognition  in a manner consistent with our recognition of revenue that has been deferred 
such direct costs can include transaction processing costs employee costs incurred in performing transaction services vendor costs incurred in performing transaction services costs incurred in performing required monitoring of and reporting on contract performance costs incurred in maintaining and processing member and provider eligibility costs incurred in communicating with members and providers the recoverability of deferred contract costs associated with a particular contract is analyzed on a periodic basis using the undiscounted estimated cash flows of the whole contract over its remaining contract term 
if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the long lived assets and deferred contract costs  the deferred contract costs are written down by the amount of the cash flow deficiency 
if a cash flow deficiency remains after reducing the balance of the deferred contract costs to zero  any remaining long lived assets are evaluated for impairment 
any such impairment recognized would equal the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
we are currently deferring recognition of all revenue as well as all direct costs to the extent that such costs are estimated to be recoverable in idaho until the mmis in that state receives certification from cms 
for the year ended december   cost of service revenue includes million of direct costs associated with the idaho contract that would otherwise have been recorded as deferred contract costs 
in assessing the recoverability of the deferred contract costs associated with the idaho contract during  we determined that these costs should be expensed as a period cost 
medical claims and benefits payable health plans segment the following table provides the details of our medical claims and benefits payable as of the dates indicated september  september  september  december  in thousands fee for service claims incurred but not paid ibnp capitation payable pharmacy other the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable is particularly important to the determination of our financial position and results of operations in any given period 
such determination of our liability requires the application of a significant degree of judgment by our management 
as a result  the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable is subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our medical care costs include amounts that have been paid by us through the reporting date  as well as estimated liabilities for medical care costs incurred but not paid by us as of the reporting date 
such medical care cost liabilities include  among other items  unpaid fee for service claims  capitation payments owed providers  unpaid pharmacy invoices  and various medically related administrative costs that have been incurred but not paid 
we use judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions for determining the required estimates 

table of contents the most important element in estimating our medical care costs is our estimate for fee for service claims which have been incurred but not paid by us 
these fee for service costs that have been incurred but have not been paid at the reporting date are collectively referred to as medical costs that are incurred but not paid  or ibnp 
our ibnp  as reported on our balance sheet  represents our best estimate of the total amount of claims we will ultimately pay with respect to claims that we have incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we estimate our ibnp monthly using actuarial methods based on a number of factors 
as indicated in the table above  our estimated ibnp liability represented million of our total medical claims and benefits payable of million as of december  excluding amounts that we anticipate paying on behalf of a capitated provider in ohio which we will subsequently withhold from that provider s monthly capitation payment  our ibnp liability at december   was million 
the factors we consider when estimating our ibnp include  without limitation  claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience  changes in membership  provider billing practices  health care service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza  provider contract changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
our assessment of these factors is then translated into an estimate of our ibnp liability at the relevant measuring point through the calculation of a base estimate of ibnp  a further reserve for adverse claims development  and an estimate of the administrative costs of settling all claims incurred through the reporting date 
the base estimate of ibnp is derived through application of claims payment completion factors and trended pmpm cost estimates 
for the fifth month of service prior to the reporting date and earlier  we estimate our outstanding claims liability based on actual claims paid  adjusted for estimated completion factors 
completion factors seek to measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will have been paid for a given month of service as of the reporting date  based on historical payment patterns 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december  that would have resulted had we changed our completion factors for the fifth through the twelfth months preceding december   by the percentages indicated 
a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
september  decrease increase in estimated completion factors increase decrease in medical claims and benefits payable for the four months of service immediately prior to the reporting date  actual claims paid are not a reliable measure of our ultimate liability  given the inherent delay between the patient physician encounter and the actual submission of a claim for payment 
for these months of service  we estimate our claims liability based on trended pmpm cost estimates 
these estimates are designed to reflect recent trends in payments and expense  utilization patterns  authorized services  and other relevant factors 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december  that would have resulted had we altered our trend factors by the percentages indicated 
an increase in the pmpm costs results in an increase in medical claims liabilities 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
september  decrease increase in trended per member per month cost estimates increase decrease in medical claims and benefits payable 
table of contents the following per share amounts are based on a combined federal and state statutory tax rate of  and million diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december  assuming a hypothetical change in completion factors from those used in our calculation of ibnp at december   net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  or per diluted share 
assuming a hypothetical change in pmpm cost estimates from those used in our calculation of ibnp at december   net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  or per diluted share 
the corresponding figures for a change in completion factors and pmpm cost estimates would be million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
it is important to note that any change in the estimate of either completion factors or trended pmpm costs would usually be accompanied by a change in the estimate of the other component  and that a change in one component would almost always compound rather than offset the resulting distortion to net income 
when completion factors are overestimated  trended pmpm costs tend to be underestimated 
both circumstances will create an overstatement of net income 
likewise  when completion factors are underestimated  trended pmpm costs tend to be overestimated  creating an understatement of net income 
in other words  errors in estimates involving both completion factors and trended pmpm costs will usually act to drive estimates of claims liabilities and medical care costs in the same direction 
if completion factors were overestimated by  resulting in an overstatement of net income by approximately million  it is likely that trended pmpm costs would be underestimated  resulting in an additional overstatement of net income 
after we have established our base ibnp reserve through the application of completion factors and trended pmpm cost estimates  we then compute an additional liability  once again using actuarial techniques  to account for adverse developments in our claims payments which the base actuarial model is not intended to and does not account for 
we refer to this additional liability as the provision for adverse claims development 
the provision for adverse claims development is a component of our overall determination of the adequacy of our ibnp 
it is intended to capture the potential inadequacy of our ibnp estimate as a result of our inability to adequately assess the impact of factors such as changes in the speed of claims receipt and payment  the relative magnitude or severity of claims  known outbreaks of disease such as influenza  our entry into new geographical markets  our provision of services to new populations such as the aged  blind or disabled abd  changes to state controlled fee schedules upon which a large proportion of our provider payments are based  modifications and upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices  and increasing medical costs 
because of the complexity of our business  the number of states in which we operate  and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states  we make an overall assessment of ibnp after considering the base actuarial model reserves and the provision for adverse claims development 
we also include in our ibnp liability an estimate of the administrative costs of settling all claims incurred through the reporting date 
the development of ibnp is a continuous process that we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims payment information becomes available 
as additional information becomes known to us  we adjust our actuarial model accordingly to establish ibnp 
on a monthly basis  we review and update our estimated ibnp and the methods used to determine that liability 
any adjustments  if appropriate  are reflected in the period known 
while we believe our current estimates are adequate  we have in the past been required to increase significantly our claims reserves for periods previously reported  and may be required to do so again in the future 
any significant increases to prior period claims reserves would materially decrease reported earnings for the period in which the adjustment is made 
in our judgment  the estimates for completion factors will likely prove to be more accurate than trended pmpm cost estimates because estimated completion factors are subject to fewer variables in their determination 
specifically  completion factors are developed over long periods of time  and are most likely to be affected by changes in claims receipt and payment experience and by provider billing practices 
trended pmpm cost estimates  while affected by the same factors  will also be influenced by health care service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness  provider contract changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
as discussed above  however  errors in estimates involving trended pmpm costs will almost always be accompanied by errors in estimates involving completion factors  and vice versa 
in such circumstances  errors in estimation involving both completion factors and trended pmpm costs will act to drive estimates of claims liabilities and therefore medical care costs in the same direction 
assuming that base reserves have been adequately set  we believe that amounts ultimately paid out should generally be between and less than the liability recorded at the end of the period as a result of the inclusion in that liability of the allowance for adverse claims development and the accrued cost of settling those claims 
however  there can be no assurance that amounts ultimately paid out will not be higher or lower than this to range  as shown by our results for the year ended december   when the amounts ultimately paid out were less than the amount of the reserves we had established as of the beginning of that year by 

table of contents as shown in greater detail in the table below  the amounts ultimately paid out on our liabilities in fiscal years and were less than what we had expected when we had established our reserves 
while the specific reasons for the overestimation of our liabilities were different in each of the periods presented  in general the overestimations were tied to our assessment of specific circumstances at our individual health plans which were unique to those reporting periods 
we recognized a benefit from prior period claims development in the amount of million for the year ended december  this amount represents our estimate as of december  of the extent to which our initial estimate of medical claims and benefits payable at december  exceeded the amount that will ultimately be paid out in satisfaction of that liability 
the overestimation of claims liability at december  was due primarily to the following factors we overestimated the impact of a buildup in claims inventory in ohio 
we overestimated the impact of the settlement of disputed provider claims in california 
we underestimated the reduction in outpatient facility claims costs as a result of a fee schedule reduction in new mexico effective november  partially offsetting the impact of the two items above 
we recognized a benefit from prior period claims development in the amount of million for the year ended this was primarily caused by the overestimation of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable at december  the overestimation of claims liability at december  was the result of the following factors in new mexico  we underestimated the degree to which cuts to the medicaid fees schedule would reduce our liability as of december  in california  we underestimated the extent to which various network restructuring  provider contracting  and medical management initiatives had reduced our medical care costs during the second half of  thereby resulting in a lower liability at december  in estimating our claims liability at december   we adjusted our base calculation to take account of the following factors which we believe are reasonably likely to change our final claims liability amount the increasing amount of claims recoveries in texas 
recent increases in inpatient utilization in missouri  as well as a substantial increase in inpatient claims inventory 
a significant reduction to our outstanding claims recoveries in ohio 
an increase to our abd membership in california 
late enrollment of newborns  and hence late claims payments  in michigan due to issues with the state s administration system  which has disrupted the normal completion pattern for claims in that state 
the use of a consistent methodology in estimating our liability for claims and medical benefits payable minimizes the degree to which the under or overestimation of that liability at the close of one period may affect consolidated results of operations in subsequent periods 
facts and circumstances unique to the estimation process at any single date  however  may still lead to a material impact on consolidated results of operations in subsequent periods 
any absence of adverse claims development as well as the expensing through general and administrative expense of the costs to settle claims held at the start of the period will lead to the recognition of a benefit from prior period claims development in the period subsequent to the date of the original estimate 
in and  the absence of adverse development of the liability for claims and medical benefits payable at the close of the previous period resulted in the recognition of substantial favorable prior period development 
in both years  however  the recognition of a benefit from prior period claims development did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations because the amount of benefit recognized in each year was roughly consistent with that recognized in the previous year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments  receivables  and restricted investments 
we invest a substantial portion of our cash in the pfm fund prime series institutional class  and the pfm fund government series 
these funds represent a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities that are managed by pfm asset management llc pfm  a virginia business trust registered as an open end management investment fund 
our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents are managed by professional portfolio managers operating under documented investment guidelines 
no investment that is in a loss position can be sold by our managers without our prior approval 
our investments consist solely of investment grade debt securities with a maximum maturity of five years and an average duration of two years or less 
restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit and us treasury securities 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to payors consisting principally of the governments of each state in which our health plans segment and our molina medicaid solutions segment operate 
inflation we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of health care services 
through these contracted providers  our health plans emphasize preventive health care and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
there can be no assurance  however  that our strategies to mitigate health care cost inflation will be successful 
competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from health care providers and customers  applicable regulations  or other factors may affect our ability to control health care costs 
compliance costs our health plans are regulated by both state and federal government agencies 
regulation of managed care products and health care services is an evolving area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws and rules occur frequently 
compliance with such laws and rules may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of additional systems  procedures and programs that we have not yet identified
