new accounting pronouncements the following md a should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the financial statements 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and using accounting policies in full compliance with ifrs and international accounting standards ias issued by the international accounting standards board iasb and interpretations of the international financial reporting interpretations committee  effective for the company s reporting for the year ended december  as a foreign private issuer in the us  ivanhoe is permitted to file with the sec financial statements prepared under ifrs without a reconciliation to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
it is possible that some of our accounting policies under ifrs could be different from us gaap 
the date of this discussion is march  unless otherwise noted  tabular amounts are in thousands of us dollars 
oil and gas production  revenue  reserves and related measures are presented net of royalty payments to governments 

table of contents highlights  except as stated production bbls d realized oil prices bbl oil revenue capital expenditures cash flow used in operating activities net loss net loss per share basic and diluted oil production increased in as ivanhoe received additional volumes to offset capital expenditures incurred at dagang in additional production  in combination with stronger realized prices  resulted in higher oil revenue for the company 
the net loss in was million compared to a million net loss in although oil revenue increased in  net income was impacted by higher operating and general and administrative expenses as well as lower non cash foreign currency exchange and derivative instrument gains in comparison to the current year also benefitted from lower exploration and evaluation expenses than in the prior year 
capital expenditures totaled million in in china  the yixin and zitong gas wells at the company s zitong project in china were tested and fracture stimulated 
at dagang  four wells were drilled and completed in a well drilled in was also completed in early the fracture stimulation program at dagang continued throughout in the nyalga basin of mongolia  ivanhoe s first exploration well  n e a  was drilled and abandoned as the well did not encounter oil shows in the reservoir 
the company observed oil staining  fluorescence and increases in background gas at its second exploration well site at n e b 
in canada  regulators completed their initial review of the company s application for the tamarack project and  as is customary  provided the company with an initial set of supplemental information requests in the third quarter of the company submitted the supplemental information to the regulators in the fourth quarter of project advancement  as currently envisaged  is subject to regulatory approval and financing 
in ecuador  ivanhoe completed a kilometre d seismic survey of block following analysis of the seismic program  the company plans to drill an exploration well into the deeper hollin and pre cretaceous horizons in the southern part of the pungarayacu block 
the well will test the potential for lighter oil resources  which would prove beneficial for blending purposes and overall project economics 
results of operations revenue oil revenue s production asia net bbls dagang daqing total production average daily production bbls d pricing average realized oil price bbl average brent bbl oil revenue in rose in comparison to due to a combination of higher production volumes and stronger realized prices 
gross oil production from the dagang field in china was relatively constant 
however  the terms of the company s psc at dagang with cnpc stipulate that capital expenditures are to be funded by ivanhoe and cnpc s portion of the costs are reimbursed through the receipt of additional oil sales 
due to higher levels of capital activity at dagang in  additional oil production was allocated to ivanhoe 

table of contents dagang production is sold at the prior three month rolling average price of cinta crude  which historically averages bbl less than brent crude  the standard the company uses for its china reserve estimates 
following the increase in cinta crude prices in  our realized oil prices rose compared to netbacks bbl realized oil prices less operating costs field operating windfall levy engineering and support costs net operating revenue depletion net revenue from operations realized oil prices per barrel  net operating revenue per barrel and net revenue from operations per barrel do not have standardized meanings prescribed by ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies 
please refer to the non ifrs financial measures under the advisories section in this md a for more details 
operating costs s asia field operating windfall levy engineering support technology development ftf operating costs total operating costs operating costs in china rose by million in in comparison to the increase is primarily attributable to the windfall levy administered by the people s republic of china which rises with higher oil prices 
historically  the windfall levy was imposed at progressive rates from to on the portion of the monthly weighted average sales price exceeding bbl 
effective november   the ministry of finance of the people s republic of china raised the windfall levy threshold to bbl 
field operating costs in total increased over the prior year due to additional production volumes in however  on a per barrel basis  field operating costs in were consistent with the prior year 
operating costs in the technology development segment are incurred at the company s feedstock test facility ftf at the southwest research institute in san antonio  texas 
ftf operating costs in are higher than in due to activities associated with assay and analyses related to the successful upgrading of the heavy oil recovered from the pungarayacu ip b well in ecuador and planned maintenance costs associated with enhancements implemented at the ftf in the second quarter of exploration and evaluation costs of exploring for  and evaluating  oil and gas properties are initially capitalized as intangible exploration and evaluation assets and charged to exploration and evaluation e e expense only if sufficient reserves cannot be established 
in  million of drilling costs were expensed in connection with the exploration well in mongolia that was plugged and abandoned 
in addition  it was determined that million of expenditures related to the seismic program in ecuador would have limited future value and were therefore charged to e e expense 
following the drilling of the zitong and yixin wells  areas excluding those identified for development and future production were to be relinquished at the end of  consequently million of geological costs incurred in prior periods were expensed as e e costs in ivanhoe drilled two appraisal wells on block in ecuador in the first appraisal well  ip  encountered cementing and completion problems prior to steam injection operations  therefore testing was suspended without recovering oil 
as a result  million of drilling and testing costs were expensed as e e costs in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents general and administrative g a expenses incurred in were million higher in comparison to staff costs rose million as a result of the company s growing commitments to its projects around the world 
professional fees increased as incremental legal costs of million were incurred in connection with the proceedings described in part i  item of this form k and million of additional contract engineering costs related to ivanhoe s htl technology were incurred to investigate new applications 
g a in also includes million of financing and filing fees associated with the cdn million convertible unsecured subordinated debentures convertible debentures issued in the second quarter of rising costs in were offset by lower charitable contributions  in  the company committed to a million donation to flood victims in ecuador 
depletion and depreciation depletion and depreciation expense in rose in comparison to due to a combination of factors 
depletion in asia increased million in due to higher production  despite a lower depletion rate as the result of additional dagang reserves recorded on january  the depreciation expense incurred by the technology segment was million higher in due to revisions of the dismantled commercial demonstration facility salvage values reducing depreciation in foreign exchange the company incurred a smaller net foreign exchange gain in in comparison to the prior year 
the canadian dollar was stronger than the us dollar in the first nine months of  subsequently weakening in the fourth quarter of net foreign exchange gains incurred on the translation of the company s canadian dollar denominated cash  debt and payables in the first three quarters of were partially offset by net foreign exchange losses in the fourth quarter 
in the first quarter of  the company incurred a net foreign exchange gain on the translation of its canadian dollar cash raised in the cdn million private placement when the canadian dollar strengthened against the us dollar  which was partially offset by a net foreign exchange loss incurred in the second quarter of when the canadian dollar weakened 
in the second half of  additional foreign exchange gains were incurred on the translation of monetary items as the canadian dollar continued to strengthen relative to the us dollar 
derivative instruments in  the unrealized gain on derivative instruments was less than in the prior year 
an unrealized gain on the convertible debentures totaled million and a combination of the expiry and revaluation of the company s purchase warrants resulted in a gain of million 
additionally  a gain of million was recognized on the revaluation of the convertible portion of the cdn million convertible promissory note issued to talisman convertible note 
the revaluation of an option granted to a private investor in january to acquire an equity interest in one of the company s subsidiaries created a loss of million in the current year 
the million unrealized gain recorded in stemmed from a million and million gain  respectively  on the revaluation of the purchase warrants and convertible note 
gain on derecognition of long term provision as part of a merger agreement  the company assumed a million contingent obligation 
in the third quarter of  the company determined  based on recent events and clarification of contract terms  that satisfaction of the specific contractual contingencies was unlikely and the liability was derecognized 
provision for income taxes current taxes increased due to higher oil revenue in than in the comparable period 
ivanhoe incurred a future tax recovery of million in due to capital spending in china and continued operating loss carryforwards in the us 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commitments the following information about our contractual obligations and other commitments summarizes certain liquidity and capital resource requirements 
the information presented in the table below does not include planned  but not legally committed  capital expenditures or obligations that are discretionary and or being performed under contracts which are cancelable with a day notification period 
total after long term debt interest on long term debt short term debt and interest asset retirement obligations zitong appraisal program leases total represents undiscounted asset retirement obligations after inflation 
the discounted value of these estimated obligations million is provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
long term debt and interest as described in the financial statements  the company issued cdn million of convertible debentures maturing on june  the convertible debentures bear interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually on the last day of june and december of each year  commencing on december  short term debt and interest on december   ivanhoe entered into a loan agreement for million with ivanhoe capital finance ltd 
the funds were advanced on january  and incur interest at a rate of per annum 
the principal balance matures in days or earlier in the case of certain events 
decommissioning provisions the company is required to remedy the effect of our activities on the environment at our operating sites by dismantling and removing production facilities and remediating any damage caused 
at december   ivanhoe estimated the total undiscounted  inflated cost to settle its asset retirement obligations in canada  for the ftf in the us and in ecuador was million 
these costs are expected to be incurred in  and  respectively 
ivanhoe does not make such a provision for decommissioning costs in connection with its oil and gas operations in china as dry holes are abandoned as they occur and productive wells will not be abandoned while the company has an economic interest in the field 
leases the company has long term leases for office space and vehicles  which expire between and zitong appraisal program the terms of the supplementary agreement call for the completion of an appraisal program by the end of june the work program is expected to consist of a sq 
km of d seismic survey  as well as drilling and completing three horizontal wells on the guan and wen structures 
other should ivanhoe receive government and other approvals necessary to develop the northern border of one of the tamarack project leases  the company will be required to make a cash payment to talisman of up to cdn million  as a conditional  final payment for the purchase transaction 
from time to time  ivanhoe enters into consulting agreements whereby a success fee may be payable if and when either a definitive agreement is signed or certain other contractual milestones are met 
under the agreements  the consultant may receive cash  common shares  stock options or some combination thereof 
similarly  agreements entered into by the company may contain cancellation fees or liquidated damages provisions for early termination 
these fees are not considered to be material 

table of contents the company may provide indemnities to third parties  in the ordinary course of business  that are customary in certain commercial transactions  such as purchase and sale agreements 
the terms of these indemnities will vary based upon the contract  the nature of which prevents ivanhoe from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amounts that may be required to be paid 
the company s management is of the opinion that any resulting settlements relating to indemnities are not likely to be material 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is subject to legal proceedings being brought against it 
while the final outcome of these proceedings is uncertain  the company believes that these proceedings  in the aggregate  are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial position or earnings 
sources and uses of cash the company s cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  are summarized in the following table net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities ivanhoe s cash flow from operating activities is not sufficient to meet its operating and capital obligations over the next twelve months 
the company intends to use its working capital to meet its commitments 
however  additional sources of funding will be required to grow the company s major projects and fully develop its oil and gas properties 
historically  ivanhoe has used external sources of funding such as public and private equity and debt markets 
however  there is no assurance that these sources of funding will be available to the company in the future or available on acceptable terms 
operating activities cash used in operating activities in the current year was lower than in as growth in revenue exceeded increases in operating costs and g a expenses 
investing activities e e expenditures e e capital expenditures for the company in totaled million 
the yixin and zitong gas wells at the company s zitong project in china were tested and fracture stimulated 
subsequent to post fracture gas flow tests  down hole electronic recorders were installed to gather additional pressure data during an extended shut in period 
the data was analyzed and will be used in future operations 
in the nyalga basin of mongolia  expenditures incurred on the company s first exploration well at n e a were expensed 
the drilling rig was mobilized to a second site  n e b  and drilling commenced in the middle of september where oil staining  fluorescence and increases in background gas were observed 
in canada  regulators have completed their initial review of the company s application for the tamarack project and  as is customary  provided the company with an initial set of supplemental information requests in the third quarter of the company submitted supplemental information to the regulators in the fourth quarter of in ecuador  the company completed a kilometre d seismic survey of block the seismic data will assist in the selection of future drilling locations 
in comparison  ivanhoe spent million on e e capital expenditure in the company successfully drilled two wells  yixin and zitong  to total depth 
ivanhoe completed its winter delineation drilling program at tamarack in early and  in november  submitted its regulatory application to the government of alberta 
two appraisal wells were drilled in on block in ecuador 
the first appraisal well  ip  encountered certain cementing and completion problems prior to steam injection operations and testing was suspended without recovering oil 
the second appraisal well  ip b  was successfully drilled  cored and logged 
property  plant and equipment expenditures in  property  plant and equipment pp e additions totaled million 
at dagang  four wells were drilled and completed 
a well drilled in was also completed in early the fracture stimulation program at dagang continued throughout the year 

table of contents in  million of pp e additions were incurred as the company conducted five fracture stimulations at the dagang field during the year 
restricted cash ivanhoe was required to post a million performance bond as part of the completion and signing of the supplementary agreement with cnpc in december financing activities cash provided by financing activities was lower in than in the prior year 
in june  the company raised million  net of issuance costs  through the issuance of the convertible debentures 
the net proceeds were used to repay the convertible note due to talisman on july   as well as operating expenses and capital expenditures 
in the first quarter of  cash proceeds of million were raised through the exercise of purchase warrants and stock options 
in comparison  the company raised million  net of issuance costs  through a private placement of million special warrants at a price of cdn per special warrant in capital structure as at december  debt long term debt shareholders equity ivanhoe intends to use its cash and cash equivalent balance to fulfill its commitments and partially fund operations in cash flow may be insufficient to meet operating requirements in the next twelve months and additional sources of funding  either at a parent company level or at a project level  will be required to grow the company s major projects and fully develop its oil and gas properties 
historically  ivanhoe has used external sources of funding  such as public and private equity and debt markets 
ivanhoe intends to finance its future funding requirements through a combination of strategic investors and or public and private debt and equity markets  either at a parent company level or at the project level  and through the sale of interests in existing oil and gas properties 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing  or obtain it on favorable terms  and any future equity issuances may be dilutive to current investors 
if ivanhoe cannot secure additional financing  the company may have to delay its capital programs and forfeit or dilute its rights in existing oil and gas property interests 
critical accounting principles and estimates the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with ifrs as issued by the iasb 
the financial statements are not subject to qualification relating to the application of ifrs as issued by the iasb 
a detailed summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note to the financial statements 
some of these policies involve critical accounting estimates as they require the company to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following section discusses critical accounting estimates and assumptions and how they affect the amounts reported in the company s financial statements 
intangible e e assets management must determine if intangible e e assets  which have not yet resulted in the discovery of proved reserves  should continue to be capitalized or charged to e e expense 
when making this determination  ivanhoe considers factors such as the company s drilling results  planned exploration and development activities  the financial capacity of the company to further develop the property  the ability to use the company s htl technology in certain projects  lease expiries  market conditions and technical recommendations from its exploration staff 
although the company believes its estimates are reasonable and consistent with current conditions  internal planning and expected future operations  such estimates are subject to significant uncertainties and judgments 
ivanhoe cannot predict if an event that triggers impairment will occur  when it will occur or how it will affect the reported asset amounts 

table of contents impairment property  plant and equipment the company periodically assesses its oil and gas assets  or groups of assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
among other things  an impairment may be triggered by falling oil and gas prices  a significant negative revision to reserve estimates  the inability to use the company s htl technology in certain projects  changes in capital costs or the inability to raise sufficient financial resources to further develop the property 
cash flow estimates for the company s impairment assessments require significant assumptions about future prices and costs  production  reserves volumes and discount rates  as well as potential benefits from the application of its htl technology 
given the significant assumptions required and the likelihood that actual conditions will differ  the assessment of impairment is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
it is difficult to determine and assess how a change in future costs  production  reserves volumes  or the application of htl technology could impact ivanhoe s impairment tests 
a increase in the discount rate and a decrease in the forward pricing used in the calculation of cash flows from proved plus probable reserves as at december   would not impair the company s development project 
intangible technology assets the company s intangible technology assets consist of an exclusive  irrevocable license to deploy its htl technology 
ivanhoe annually reviews the technology assets for impairment or if an adverse event or change occurs 
indicators of adverse events could include htl patent expiries  advancements of new technologies or the inability to successfully commercialize the htl technology 
the intangible asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it requires ivanhoe to make assumptions about competitive technological developments  the successful commercialization of its htl technology and future cash flows from the htl technology 
ivanhoe cannot predict if an event that triggers impairment will occur  when it will occur or how it will affect the reported asset amounts 
although the company believes its estimates are reasonable and consistent with current conditions  internal planning and expected future operations  such estimates are subject to significant uncertainties and judgments 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of reserves is inherently uncertain and complex 
it requires significant judgments and decisions based on available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
these estimates may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development activities and production becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and costs change 
such revisions could be upwards or downwards 
for details on our reserve estimation process  refer to the section titled reserves  production and related information in items and of this annual report 
reserve estimates have a material impact on depletion and the company s impairment evaluations  which in turn have a material impact on earnings 
total proved and probable reserves estimates are used to determine rates used in the unit of production depletion calculations 
in the year ended december   depletion expense of million was recorded 
if proved and probable reserves estimates changed by  the company s depletion and depreciation expense would have changed by approximately million  assuming all other variables remained constant 
option pricing model the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and equity settled restricted share units rsus on the date of grant 
determining the fair value of stock based awards on the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the award  the expected volatility of the company s common shares and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is required to estimate the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited 
changes in assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value  and therefore  the existing models do not necessarily provide precise measures of fair value 
convertible debentures on june   the company issued cdn million of convertible debentures 
the canadian dollar denominated debt is considered to contain an embedded derivative since the functional currency of the company is the us dollar 
as a result  the convertible debentures were bifurcated into debt and the convertible option  which was recognized at fair value using the black scholes valuation method 
changes in the fair value of the convertible option are recorded in earnings  therefore the valuation of the convertible option is a critical accounting estimate 

table of contents the black scholes valuation method requires the input of highly subjective assumptions regarding expected volatility of the company s share price and the risk free interest rate 
if the volatility used to fair value the convertible component at december  decreased by  the fair value of the convertible option would decrease by million 
if volatility increased by  the fair value of the convertible option would increase by million 
convertible note in connection with the acquisition of the tamarack leases in july from talisman  the company issued a cdn million convertible note 
the canadian dollar denominated debt was considered to contain an embedded derivative since the functional currency of the company is the us dollar 
as a result  the convertible note was bifurcated into debt and the convertible option  which was recognized at fair value using the black scholes valuation method 
changes in the fair value of the convertible option were recorded in earnings  and as a result  the valuation of the convertible option was a critical accounting estimate prior to the maturity of the convertible note on july  deferred income taxes ivanhoe operates in a specialized industry and in several tax jurisdictions 
as a result  the company s income is subject to various rates of taxation 
the breadth of the company s operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating the taxes that the company will ultimately pay 
the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxation authorities in various jurisdictions  uncertain tax positions and resolution of disputes arising from federal  provincial  state and local tax audits 
the deferred income tax liability is a critical accounting estimate because it requires ivanhoe to make assumptions about the resolution of these uncertainties and the associated final taxes may result in adjustments to the company s tax assets and tax liabilities 
new accounting pronouncements transition to international financial reporting standards effective january   ivanhoe adopted ifrs  as issued by the iasb  as the company s basis for accounting 
most adjustments required on transition to ifrs were made retrospectively against opening retained earnings as of the date of the first comparative statement of financial position 
transitional adjustments relating to those standards where comparative gures are not required to be restated will only be made as of the rst day of the year of adoption 

table of contents first time adoption of international financial reporting standards first time adoption of international financial reporting standards ifrs provides companies adopting ifrs for the rst time with a number of optional exemptions and mandatory exceptions to the general requirement for full retrospective application of ifrs where retrospective restatement would either be onerous or would not provide more useful information 
as a result of relying upon the exemptions described below  there was no material impact in these areas at the date of transition to ifrs 
area of ifrs summary of exemption available property  plant and equipment companies may elect to report property  plant and equipment from oil and gas operations on the opening statement of financial position on the transition date at a deemed cost  instead of the actual cost  as though ifrs had been adopted retroactively 
the deemed cost of an item may be either its fair value at the date of transition to ifrs or an amount reported under canadian gaap 
the exemption can be applied on an asset by asset basis 
ivanhoe elected to report property  plant and equipment from oil and gas operations in its opening statement of financial position on the transition date at the deemed cost previously calculated under canadian gaap 
decommissioning liabilities in accounting for changes in decommissioning liabilities  ifrs requires changes in such obligations to be added to  or deducted from  the cost of the asset to which they relate 
the adjusted depreciable amount of the asset is then depreciated prospectively over its remaining useful life 
rather than recalculating the effect of all such changes throughout the life of the obligation  companies may elect to measure the liability and the related depreciation effects at the date of transition to ifrs 
ivanhoe elected to measure only those decommissioning liabilities outstanding from the ftf on the date of transition to ifrs 
stock based compensation companies may elect not to apply ifrs  share based payment  to stock options granted on or before november   or which vested before the date of transition to ifrs 
ivanhoe elected to utilize this exemption for the all stock options awarded after november   that vested before january  business combinations companies may elect to either restate all past business combinations in accordance with ifrs  business combinations  or to apply an elective exemption from applying ifrs to past business combinations 
ivanhoe elected to utilize this exemption and transactions entered into prior to the transition date will not be restated 

table of contents areas of signi cance ifrs had a significant impact on the company s ongoing accounting in the areas described below  in addition to the impact of transition policy choices made under ifrs accounting policy area impact of policy adoption exploration and evaluation assets the company followed the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas operations under canadian cdn gaap  whereby all costs related to the exploration for  and development of  oil and gas reserves were capitalized and periodically evaluated for impairment 
under ifrs  exploration costs will initially be capitalized as e e assets until it can be determined if sufficient quantities of reserves have been found to justify commercial production 
if commercial quantities of reserves are found  e e assets will be reclassified to oil and gas properties and development costs and  if not  e e assets will be expensed on the consolidated statement of loss 
costs incurred in connection with our projects in canada  ecuador  mongolia and exploration projects in china were reclassified as e e assets  while producing assets in china continued to be classified as oil and gas properties and development costs on the consolidated statement of financial position 
impairments cdn gaap generally used a two step approach to impairment testing rst comparing asset carrying values with undiscounted future cash ows to determine whether impairment exists and then measuring any impairment by comparing asset carrying values with fair values calculated using discounted cash flows 
international accounting standard  impairment of assets  uses a one step approach for both testing and measuring of impairment  with asset carrying values compared directly with the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use which uses discounted future cash ows 
this may potentially result in more write downs where carrying values of assets were previously supported under cdn gaap on an undiscounted cash ow basis  but could not be supported on a discounted cash ow basis 
ifrs also requires the reversal of any previous impairment losses where circumstances have changed such that impairments have been reduced 
cdn gaap prohibited the reversal of impairment losses 
ifrs will result in greater variability in our operating results and asset carrying values 
capitalized g a g a directly related to exploration and development activities was capitalized as oil and gas properties and development costs under cdn gaap 
the threshold to capitalize g a is higher under ifrs  therefore  less g a will be capitalized in the future and g a on the consolidated statement of loss will be higher as a result 
financial instruments under cdn gaap  the equity component of the company s convertible note and the common share purchase warrants were classified as shareholders equity 
in accordance with ias  financial instruments presentation  financial instruments with an exercise price denominated in a currency other than our functional currency are accounted for as derivatives 
since our convertible note and common share purchase warrants are denominated in cdn dollars and our functional currency is us dollars  these items were reclassified from shareholders equity to liabilities under ifrs 
additionally  ifrs requires derivative instruments to be recorded at fair value with changes in their fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of loss 
this will create variability in our results of operations and the carrying value of liabilities 
stock based compensation stock options were accounted for using the fair value method under cdn gaap 
the fair value was determined using the black scholes option pricing model and recorded as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the period that the stock options vested 
under ifrs  share based payment  compensation expense will be charged to earnings on a graded vesting basis 
this will accelerate the compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statement of loss in comparison to cdn gaap 
new accounting pronouncements the information contained in note  standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted  to our financial statements in part ii  item is incorporated by reference into this part ii  item off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed in varying degrees to normal market risks inherent in the oil and gas industry  including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  credit risk and liquidity risk 
we recognize these risks and manage our operations to minimize our exposures to the extent practicable 
commodity price risk commodity price risk related to oil prices is one of ivanhoe s most significant market risk exposures 
the company s operating results and financial condition are influenced by the prices the company receives for its oil production 
oil prices may fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors including global and domestic economic conditions  weather conditions  political stability  transportation facilities  the price and availability of alternative fuels and government regulations 
based on estimated production  a us bbl change in the price of oil would increase or decrease net income and cash flows from operations for by us bbl 
in the past  ivanhoe has used derivatives to minimize variability in the company s cash flow from operations when required to do so by loan covenants 
however  no hedging contracts were in place in and the company does not anticipate using hedging contracts in to manage its commodity price risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk ivanhoe is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of incurring capital expenditures and operating costs in currencies other than the us dollar 
a substantial portion of our activities are transacted in or referenced to us dollars  including oil sales in asia  capital spending in ecuador and ongoing ftf operations 
a portion of our transactions are in other currencies  such as dagang operating costs paid in chinese renminbi  tamarack exploration activities funded in cdn dollars and the cdn dollar convertible debentures issued in the company did not enter into any foreign currency derivatives in  nor do we anticipate using foreign currency derivatives in to help reduce the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  it seeks to hold assets and liabilities denominated in the same currency when appropriate 
the following table shows the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk on its net loss and comprehensive loss for  assuming reasonably possible changes in the relevant foreign currency 
this analysis assumes all other variables remain constant 
increase decrease in net loss and comprehensive loss increase or weakening decrease or strengthening chinese renminbi canadian dollar credit risk ivanhoe is exposed to credit risk with respect to its cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  accounts receivable  note receivable and long term receivables 
the company s maximum exposure to credit risk at december   is represented by the carrying amount of these non derivative financial assets 
most of the company s credit exposures are with counterparties in the energy industry and are therefore exposed to normal industry credit risks 
ivanhoe manages its credit risk by only entering into sales contracts with established entities 
the company believes its exposure to credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents  as well as restricted cash  is minimal due to the quality of the financial institutions where the funds are held and the nature of the deposit instruments 
currently  all of the company s oil production is sold to one national oil corporation 
as a result  of the outstanding accounts receivable balance at december  december  is due from a national oil corporation 
long term value added tax receivable from the ecuadorian government will be recoverable upon commencement of commercial operations 
ivanhoe considers the risk of default on these items to be low due to the company s ongoing operations in china and ecuador 

table of contents liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for the company s business activities may not be available 
since cash flows from existing operations are insufficient to fund future capital expenditures  we intend to finance future capital projects with a combination of strategic investors and or public and private debt and equity markets  either at the parent company level or at the project level or from the sale of existing assets 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing or obtain it on favorable terms 
non ifrs financial measures the company s realized oil price per barrel is calculated by dividing oil revenue by the company s total production for the respective periods presented 
net operating revenue per barrel is calculated by dividing oil revenue less operating costs by total production for the respective periods presented 
net revenue loss from operations per barrel is calculated by subtracting depletion from net operating revenue and dividing by total production for the respective periods presented 
the company believes oil revenue per barrel  net operating revenue per barrel and net revenue loss from operations per barrel are important to investors to evaluate operating results and the company s ability to generate cash 
each of the components used in these calculations can be reconciled directly to the consolidated statement of loss and comprehensive loss 
the calculations of oil revenue per barrel  net operating revenue per barrel and net revenue loss from operations per barrel may differ from similar calculations of other companies in the oil and gas industry  thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure
