the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are in the business of designing  developing and manufacturing energy recovery devices for seawater reverse osmosis desalination 
our company was founded in  and we introduced the initial version of our pressure exchangertm energy recovery device in early in december  we acquired pump engineering  llc  which manufactures centrifugal energy recovery devices  known as turbochargers  and high pressure pumps 
a significant portion of our net revenue typically has been generated by sales to a limited number of large engineering  procurement and construction firms  which are involved with the design and construction of larger desalination plants 
sales to these firms often involve a long sales cycle  which can range from six to months 
a single large desalination project can generate an order for numerous energy recovery devices and generally represents an opportunity for significant revenue 
we also sell our devices to many small to medium sized original equipment manufacturers  or oems  which commission smaller desalination plants  order fewer energy recovery devices per plant and have shorter sales cycles 
due to the fact that a single order for our energy recovery devices by a large engineering  procurement and construction firm for a particular plant may represent significant revenue  we often experience significant fluctuations in net revenue from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
in addition  historically our engineering  procurement and construction firm customers tend to order a significant amount of equipment for delivery in the fourth quarter and  as a consequence  a significant portion of our annual sales typically occurs during that quarter 
in fiscal years and  the fourth quarter revenues did not reflect as high of a percentage of the annual revenues as in past years due to the overall lower percentage of sales to engineering  procurement  and construction firms in and customer project delays in a limited number of our customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenue and accounts receivables 
revenue from customers representing or more of total revenue varies from period to period 
for the year ended december   one customer accounted for approximately of our net revenue 
for the year ended december   two customers accounted for approximately and of our net revenue  respectively 
for the year ended december   three customers accounted for approximately   and of our net revenue  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of our net revenue during any of these periods 
see note concentrations in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further customer concentration detail 
during the years ended december   and  most of our revenue was attributable to sales outside of the united states 
we expect sales outside of the united states to remain a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our revenue is principally derived from the sale of our energy recovery devices 
we also derive revenue from the sale of our high pressure and circulation pumps  which we manufacture and sell in connection with our energy recovery devices for use in desalination plants 
we also receive incidental revenue from the sale of spare parts and from services  including start up and commissioning services  that we provide for our customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial results will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are revenue recognition  warranty costs  share based compensation  inventory valuation  allowances for doubtful accounts  income taxes including our evaluation of the need for any valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  and our evaluation and measurement of contingencies  including contingent consideration 
cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents 
cash equivalents are stated at cost  which approximates fair value 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained primarily in demand deposit accounts with large financial institutions and in institutional money market funds 
we frequently monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and institutional money market funds in which we invest our surplus funds 
we have not experienced any credit losses from our cash investments 
allowances for doubtful accounts we record a provision for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and a detailed assessment of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider  among other factors  the aging of the accounts receivable  our historical write offs  the credit worthiness of each customer and general economic conditions 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
actual write offs may be in excess of our estimated allowance 
short term and long term investments our short term and long term investments consist primarily of investment grade debt securities  all of which are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value 
changes in the fair value of available for sale securities are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet 
realized gains and losses on the sale of available for sale securities are determined by specific identification of the cost basis of each security 
long term investments generally will mature within three years 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost using the weighted average cost method or market 
we calculate inventory valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventories based on current inventory levels  expected useful life and estimated future demand of the products and spare parts 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and reduced by accumulated depreciation 
depreciation expense is recognized over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight line method 
estimated useful lives are generally three to ten years 
a small portion of our manufacturing equipment was acquired under capital lease obligations 
these assets are amortized over periods consistent with depreciation of owned assets of similar types  generally five to seven years 
certain equipment used in the development and manufacturing of ceramic components is generally depreciated over estimated useful lives of up to ten years 
leasehold improvements represent remodeling and retrofitting costs for leased office and manufacturing space and are depreciated over the shorter of either the estimated useful lives or the term of the lease using the straight line method 
software purchased for internal use consists primarily of amounts paid for perpetual licenses to third party software providers and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of three to five years 
estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and  when appropriate  changes are made prospectively 
when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur  asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts 
we own our manufacturing facility in new boston  michigan  which had been depreciated over an estimated useful life of years 
as a result of our plan to consolidate our north american manufacturing operations  amounts related to the building and land were classified as held for sale as of december  accordingly  we impaired the building and land held for sale by  in december to reduce the carrying value to estimated fair value 
see note other financial information for further details related to the impairment of property held for sale 
maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense as incurred  whereas improvements and renewals are generally capitalized in their respective property accounts 
when an item is retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and applicable accumulated depreciation are removed and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates 
these judgments can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
acquired intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited  ranging from one to years 
acquired intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives 
customer relationships and other non contractual intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over periods generally ranging from five to years 
patents developed internally are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight line basis over their expected useful life of to years 
when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur  an impairment assessment is performed and lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted 
goodwill is not amortized  but is evaluated annually for impairment at the reporting unit level or when indicators of a potential impairment are present 
such indicators would include a significant reduction in our market capitalization  a decrease in operating results  or deterioration in our financial positions 
we operate under a single reporting unit and  accordingly  all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company 
the annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill is based on our market capitalization 
as of december  and  acquired intangibles  including goodwill  relate to the acquisition of pump engineering  llc during the fourth quarter of see note goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of intangible assets 
fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  investments in marketable securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and debt 
the carrying amounts for these financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values 
see note fair value measurements for further discussion of fair value 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement with the customer  transfer of title occurs  fixed pricing is determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
transfer of title typically occurs upon shipment of the equipment pursuant to a written purchase order or contract 
the portion of the sales agreement related to the field services and training for commissioning of a desalination plant is deferred until we have performed such services 
we regularly evaluate our revenue arrangements to identify deliverables and to determine whether these deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting 
on january   we adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with the new guidance  when multiple elements exist in a sales agreement  we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
the new guidance provides a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  ii third party evidence tpe if available and when vsoe is not available  and iii best estimate of the selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we have established vsoe for most of our products and services as a substantial majority of selling prices fall within a narrow range when sold separately 
for deliverables with no established vsoe  we use besp to determine the standalone selling price for such deliverables as tpe is generally not available given that our products contain significant proprietary technology and solutions that differ substantially from our competitors 
we have an established process for developing besp  which incorporates historical selling prices  the effect of market conditions  gross margin objectives  pricing practices  as well as entity specific factors 
we monitor and evaluate estimated selling price on a regular basis to ensure that changes in circumstances are accounted for in a timely manner 
we may modify our pricing in the future  which could result in changes to our vsoe and besp 
the services element of our contracts represents an incidental portion of the total contract price 
the adoption of the new accounting standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
under our revenue recognition policy  evidence of an arrangement has been met when we have an executed purchase order or a stand alone contract 
typically  smaller projects utilize purchase orders that conform to standard terms and conditions that require the customer to remit payment generally within to days from product delivery 
in some cases  if credit worthiness cannot be determined  prepayment is required from the smaller customers 
for large projects  stand alone contracts are utilized 
for these contracts  consistent with industry practice  our customers typically require their suppliers  including eri  to accept contractual holdback provisions whereby the final amounts due under the sales contract are remitted over extended periods of time 
these retention payments typically range between and  and in some instances up to  of the total contract amount and are due and payable when the customer is satisfied that certain specified product performance criteria have been met upon commissioning of the desalination plant  which may be months to months from the date of product delivery as described further below 
the specified product performance criteria for our px device generally pertains to the ability of our product to meet its published performance specifications and warranty provisions  which our products have demonstrated on a consistent basis 
this factor  combined with historical performance metrics measured over the past years  provides our management with a reasonable basis to conclude that its px device will perform satisfactorily upon commissioning of the plant 
to ensure this successful product performance  we provide service  consisting principally of supervision of customer personnel and training to the customers during the commissioning of the plant 
the installation of the px device is relatively simple  requires no customization and is performed by the customer under the supervision of our personnel 
we defer the value of the service and training component of the contract and recognize such revenue as services are rendered 
based on these factors  our management has concluded that  for sale of px devices  delivery and performance have been completed when the product has been delivered title transfers to the customer 
we perform an evaluation of credit worthiness on an individual contract basis to assess whether collectability is reasonably assured 
as part of this evaluation  our management considers many factors about the individual customer  including the underlying financial strength of the customer and or partnership consortium and management s prior history or industry specific knowledge about the customer and its supplier relationships 
under the stand alone contracts  the usual payment arrangements are summarized as follows an advance payment due upon execution of the contract  typically to of the total contract amount  a payment upon delivery of the product due on average between and days from product delivery  and in some cases up to days  typically in the range of to of the total contract amount  and a retention payment due subsequent to product delivery as described further below  typically in the range of to  and in some cases up to  of the total contract amount 
under the terms of the retention payment component  we are typically required to issue to the customer a product performance guarantee that takes the form of an irrevocable standby letter of credit  which is issued to the customer approximately to months after the product delivery date 
the letter of credit is either collateralized by restricted cash on deposit with a financial institution or funds available through a credit facility 
the letter of credit remains in place for the performance period as specified in the contract  which is generally to months and  in some cases  up to months from issuance 
the performance period generally runs concurrent with our standard product warranty period 
once the letter of credit has been put in place  we invoice the customer for this final retention payment under the sales contract 
during the time between the product delivery and the issuance of the letter of credit  the amount of the final retention payment is classified on the balance sheet as an unbilled receivable  of which a portion may be classified as long term to the extent that the billable period extends beyond one year 
once the letter of credit is issued  we invoice the customer and reclassify the retention amount from unbilled receivable to accounts receivable where it remains until payment 
we do not provide our customers with a right of product return 
however  we will accept returns of products that are deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered that are covered by the terms and conditions of the product warranty 
product returns have not been significant 
reserves are established for possible product returns related to the advance replacement of products pending the determination of a warranty claim 
shipping and handling charges billed to customers are included in net revenue 
the cost of shipping to customers is included in cost of revenue 
warranty costs we sell products with a limited warranty for a period ranging from one to six years 
we accrue for warranty costs based on estimated product failure rates  historical activity and expectations of future costs 
periodically  we evaluate and adjust the warranty costs to the extent actual warranty costs vary from the original estimates 
share based compensation we measure and recognize share based compensation expense based on the fair value measurement for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors including restricted stock units  restricted shares and employee stock options over the requisite service period typically the vesting period of the awards 
the fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock is based on our stock price on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock options is calculated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires a number of complex assumptions  including expected life  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and dividend yield 
the estimation of awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and  to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimates are revised 
see note share based compensation to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of share based compensation 
foreign currency our reporting currency is the us dollar  while the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are their respective local currencies 
the asset and liability accounts of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from their local currencies at the rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of our subsidiary balance sheets are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recorded in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes current tax assets and liabilities are based upon an estimate of taxes refundable or payable for each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax 
in the ordinary course of business  there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying income tax positions 
we assess income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting dates 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements 
when applicable  associated interest and penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences arising from differences in basis of assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes 
deferred income taxes are recorded on temporary differences using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining whether and to what extent any valuation allowance is needed on our deferred tax assets 
in making such a determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including recent results of operations  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future income and available tax planning strategies 
as of december   a valuation allowance of approximately million was established to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of the tax valuation allowance 
our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the us and in foreign jurisdictions 
significant estimates and judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations 
the ultimate amount of tax liability may be uncertain as a result 
results of operations compared to the following table sets forth certain data from our historical operating results as a percentage of revenue for the years indicated for the year ended december  change increase decrease results of operations net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses general and administrative sales and marketing research and development amortization of intangible assets loss gain on fair value remeasurement restructuring charges total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense interest expense finance charges other non operating income expense  net net loss before provision for income tax provision for benefit from income tax expense net loss not meaningful percentages may not add up to due to rounding net revenue our net revenue decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue was primarily due to decreased shipments of px devices  turbochargers and pumps resulting from the continued global decline in new construction of large desalination plants  which was further exacerbated in as compared to by unanticipated global events such as civil uprisings in the middle east and the euro financial crisis 
additionally  we consolidated our north american operations and transferred our michigan based operations to our manufacturing center and headquarters in san leandro  california 
the transfer of operations resulted in some delays in shipments during the fourth quarter of lastly  the average sales prices of our px devices and turbochargers decreased slightly during due to product mix and customized configurations 
for the year ended december   the sales of px devices and related products and services accounted for approximately of our revenue and sales of turbochargers and pumps accounted for approximately 
for the year ended december   the sales of px devices and related products and services accounted for approximately of our revenue and sales of turbochargers and pumps accounted for approximately 
the following geographic information includes net revenue to our domestic and international customers based on the customers requested delivery locations  except for certain cases in which the customer directed us to deliver our products to a location that differs from the known ultimate location of use 
in such cases  the ultimate location of use is reflected in the table below instead of the delivery location 
the amounts below are in thousands  except percentage data 
years ended december  domestic net revenue international net revenue total net revenue revenue by country india united states australia algeria others total the impact of the current global economic climate on future demand for our products is uncertain 
gross profit gross profit represents our net revenue less our cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of raw materials  personnel costs including share based compensation  manufacturing overhead  warranty costs  depreciation expense  and manufactured components 
the largest component of our cost of revenue is raw materials  primarily ceramic materials 
for the year ended december   gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was  as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to underutilization of our manufacturing facilities in as a result of the decline in product demand during the current year as compared to prior year  the phase out of our michigan based manufacturing facility as part of the consolidation of our north american operations and the integration of our new ceramics facility  which went online in to a lesser extent  gross profit decreased in the current year compared to the prior year due to a slight drop in average sales prices due to changes in product mix 
future gross profit is highly dependent on the product and customer mix of our net revenues  overall market demand and competition  and the volume of production in our own ceramics factory and our assembly operations that determines our operating leverage 
accordingly  we are not able to predict our future gross profit levels with certainty 
in addition  our recent production facility expansion will continue to have a negative impact to our margins if our production volume does not increase in the foreseeable future 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expense as a percentage of our net revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  as general and administrative costs increased period over period while net revenue decreased 
general and administrative average headcount decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   largely as a result of reductions in force at our corporate headquarters during late and early and reductions in force at our michigan based facility during the second half of in february  our chief executive officer ceo announced his retirement  and our board of directors appointed a new ceo 
during the second quarter of  our board of directors appointed a new chief financial officer cfo 
general and administrative costs increased primarily as a result of non recurring expenses related to the departures of the former ceo and cfo and the appointments of a new ceo and new cfo 
of the million net increase in general and administrative expense  increases of million related to compensation and employee related benefits  million related to adjustments to bad debt reserves  million related to value added taxes  million related to professional and other services  and million related to other administrative costs 
these increases in costs were partially offset by a decrease of million related to occupancy costs 
share based compensation expense included in general and administrative expense was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense decreased by  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  sales and marketing average headcount increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  as a percentage of our net revenue  sales and marketing expense increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   as the percentage decrease in net revenue exceeded the percentage decrease in sales and marketing expense year over year 
of the  net decrease in sales and marketing expense for the year ended december   a decrease of  related to sales commissions was partially offset by increases of  in direct and other marketing costs and  in employee compensation and benefits 
share based compensation expense included in sales and marketing expense was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  research and development expense research and development expense decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  research and development expense as a percentage of our net revenue increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   as the percentage decrease in net revenue exceeded the percentage decrease in research and development expense year over year 
average headcount in our research and development department decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  share based compensation expense included in research and development expense was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the  decrease in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to prior year was primarily due to decreases of  in occupancy costs   related to research and development direct project costs  and  related to other costs 
these decreases in expense were slightly offset by an increase in compensation and employee benefits of  we anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase in the future as we expand and diversify our product offering 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to finite lived intangible assets acquired as a result of our purchase of pump engineering  llc in december these intangible assets include developed technology  non compete agreements  backlog  trademarks  and customer relationships 
amortization expense decreased by million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to backlog being fully amortized during fiscal year loss on fair value remeasurement we acquired pump engineering  llc in december under the business combinations guidance of us gaap  we initially recognized a liability of million as an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of contingent and other consideration  consisting of million of contingent consideration subject to pay out to the sellers upon the acquired company s achievement of certain milestones and of other consideration securing the sellers indemnification obligations 
the fair value measurement of the million of contingent consideration was based on the weighted probability of achievement  as of the acquisition date  that the milestones would be achieved 
in the fourth quarter of  some of the milestones were not met 
accordingly  we remeasure the estimated fair value contingent consideration on a recurring basis 
in december  we remeasured the contingent consideration at million to reflect its estimated fair value at december  this was an increase in the estimated fair value compared to million at december  we recognized a loss of  in our consolidated statement of operations as a result of the change in estimated fair value in see note business combinations to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of the loss on fair value remeasurement 
restructuring charges in july  we initiated a restructuring plan to consolidate our north american operations and transfer our michigan based operations to our manufacturing center and headquarters in san leandro  california 
the consolidation is expected to reduce costs  improve efficiencies and enhance research and development activities 
for the year ended december   we have recorded total pre tax charges of million related to this plan 
additionally  we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses related to our sales branch office in spain 
for the year ended december   we have recorded total pre tax charges of million related to this plan 
see note restructuring activities to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of restructuring activities 
both restructuring plans were essentially completed by december  and  with the exception of a continued evaluation of assets held for sale for impairment  we do not expect significant restructuring charges related to these restructuring plans in the future 
non operating income expense  net non operating income expense  net  changed favorably by  to  of other net income for the year ended december  from  of other net expense for the year ended december  the favorable change was primarily due to favorable changes in net foreign currency gains of  an increase in interest income of  and a decrease in interest expense of  the favorable change in net foreign currency gains is primarily a result of favorable changes in exchange rates and an increase in euro denominated trade receivables during compared to last year 
the favorable changes in net non operating income expense during the year ended december  were slightly offset by an increase in other non operating expenses  compared to the following table sets forth certain data from our historical operating results as a percentage of revenue for the years indicated for the year ended december  change increase decrease results of operations net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses general and administrative sales and marketing research and development amortization of intangible assets gain on fair value remeasurement total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense interest expense finance charges other non operating income expense  net net income loss before provision for income tax provision for benefit from income tax expense net income loss not meaningful percentages may not add up to due to rounding net revenue our net revenue decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenues from the sales of px devices and related products and services decreased by approximately million while revenues from the sales of turbochargers and pumps increased by approximately million 
the decrease in revenue from sales of px devices was primarily due to the timing of larger orders  a global decline in the construction of new projects and competition 
additionally  there was a slight decrease in the average sales price of px units during fiscal year the increase in revenue from sales of turbochargers and pumps was primarily due to a full year of shipments by our subsidiary  pump engineering  inc  which was acquired late in the fourth quarter of  and the timing of larger orders 
revenues from the sales of our turbochargers and related products had a very small impact on our revenue base  totaling only million for the fiscal year 
for the year ended december   the sales of px devices and related products and services accounted for approximately of our revenue and sales of turbochargers and pumps accounted for approximately 
for the year ended december   the sales of px devices and related products and services accounted for approximately of our revenue and sales of turbochargers and pumps accounted for approximately 
turbochargers and related high pressure pumps  manufactured by our subsidiary  pump engineering  inc  had a negligible impact on our product offering in  as the subsidiary was acquired late in the fourth quarter of the following geographic information includes net revenue to our domestic and international customers based on the customers requested delivery locations  except for certain cases in which the customer directed us to deliver our products to a location that differs from the known ultimate location of use 
in such cases  the ultimate location of use is reflected in the table below instead of the delivery location 
the amounts below are in thousands  except percentage data 
years ended december  domestic net revenue international net revenue total net revenue revenue by country australia algeria israel others total gross profit gross profit represents our net revenue less our cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of raw materials  personnel costs including share based compensation  manufacturing overhead  warranty costs  depreciation expense  and manufactured components 
the largest component of our cost of revenue is raw materials  primarily ceramic materials 
for the year ended december   gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to a shift of product sales to lower margin turbochargers and high pressure pumps  a result of our acquisition of pump engineering  llc in late  and an increase in overhead costs related to our px devices  largely attributed to the underutilization of our newly expanded manufacturing facility 
additionally  the amortization of an inventory valuation step up of million  stemming from our acquisition of pump engineering  llc  and a slight decline in the average selling prices of our px devices also served to negatively impact gross margin in fiscal year future gross profit is highly dependent on the product and customer mix of our net revenues  overall market demand and competition  and the volume of production in our own ceramics factory and our assembly operations that determines our operating leverage 
accordingly  we are not able to predict our future gross profit levels with certainty 
in addition  our recent production facility expansion will continue to have a negative impact to our margins if our production volume does not increase in the foreseeable future 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase of general and administrative expense was attributable primarily to increases in general and administrative headcount related to the acquisition of pump engineering  llc in december and increases in occupancy costs related to our new corporate headquarters 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of our net revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   as general and administrative costs increased in while net revenue decreased

liquidity and capital resource requirements we believe that our existing resources and cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may need to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  if any  the expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development activities  the timing and extent of our expansion into new geographic territories  the timing of new product introductions and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
we may enter into potential material investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk currently  the majority of our revenue contracts have been denominated in united states dollars 
in some circumstances  we have priced certain international sales in euros 
the amount of revenue recognized and denominated in euros amounted to million  million  and zero in   and  respectively 
we experienced a net foreign currency gain loss of approximately   and  related to our revenue contracts for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as we expand our international sales  we expect that a portion of our revenue could continue to be denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  our cash and cash equivalents and operating results could be increasingly affected by changes in exchange rates 
our international sales and marketing operations incur expense that is denominated in foreign currencies 
this expense could be materially affected by currency fluctuations 
our exposures are to fluctuations in exchange rates for the united states dollar versus the euro 
changes in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our consolidated operating results or financial position 
additionally  our international sales and marketing operations maintain cash balances denominated in foreign currencies 
in order to decrease the inherent risk associated with translation of foreign cash balances into our reporting currency  we have not maintained excess cash balances in foreign currencies 
we have not hedged our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because expenses in foreign currencies have been insignificant to date  and exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows 
interest rate risk and credit risk we have an investment portfolio of fixed income marketable debt securities  including amounts classified as cash equivalents  short term investments  and long term investments 
at december   our short term investments and long term investments totaled approximately million 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we invest primarily in high quality short term and long term debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers 
these investments are subject to interest rate fluctuations and will decrease in market value if interest rates increase 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments with an average maturity of less than three years 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximately  decrease less than in the fair value of our fixed income debt securities as of december  in addition to interest rate risk  our investments in marketable debt securities are subject to potential loss of value due to counterparty credit risk 
to minimize this risk  we invest pursuant to a board approved investment policy 
the policy mandates high credit rating requirements and restricts our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits
