item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background as discussed in item  business  we are a global diversified company that manufactures a broad range of industrial products and systems and are organized into four reportable segments  industrial  energy  electrical and engineered solutions 
the industrial segment is primarily involved in the design  manufacture and distribution of branded hydraulic and mechanical tools to the maintenance  industrial  infrastructure and production automation markets 
the energy segment provides joint integrity products and services  as well as rope and cable solutions to the global oil gas  power generation and energy markets 
the electrical segment designs  manufactures and distributes a broad range of electrical products to the retail diy  wholesale  oem  solar  utility  marine and other harsh environment markets 
the engineered solutions segment provides highly engineered position and motion control systems to oems in various vehicle markets  as well as a variety of other products to the industrial and agricultural markets 
our businesses provide a vast array of products and services across multiple customers and geographies which results in significant diversification 
the long term sales growth and profitability of our segments will depend not only on improved demand in end markets and the overall economic environment  but also on our ability to identify  consummate and integrate strategic acquisitions  develop and market innovative new products  expand our business activity geographically and continuously improve operational excellence 
we remain focused on maintaining our financial strength by adjusting our cost structure to reflect changes in demand levels and by proactively managing working capital and cash flow generation 
our priorities during fiscal include a continued focus on operational excellence  cash flow generation and growth initiatives new product development  market share gains and strategic acquisitions 
results of operations the comparability of operating results has been impacted by acquisitions  divestitures and the economic conditions that exist in the end markets we serve 
the operating results of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements only since their respective acquisition date 
additionally  changes in foreign currency exchange rates also influence our financial results as approximately one half of our sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the year over year weakening of the euro during fiscal unfavorably impacted our operating results due to the translation of euro denominated results 
impairment charges  restructuring costs and the related benefits from previously completed restructuring projects also impact the comparability of operating results 
since the global recession in and  we have taken significant actions to address our cost structure  including workforce reductions  consolidation of facilities and the centralization of certain selling and administrative functions

changes in operating profit at the segment level are discussed in further detail below 
segment results industrial segment while core sales growth in the industrial segment moderated throughout fiscal due in part to tougher prior year comparables  the segment delivered four consecutive quarters of year over year core sales growth in fiscal  driven by elevated industrial manufacturing activities 
this core sales growth and operational improvements drove segment profitability 
the industrial segment continues to focus on providing customers with innovative integrated solutions  the commercialization of new products and the expansion of its business in 
table of contents fast growing regions and vertical markets 
the following table sets forth summary results of operations for the industrial segment in millions year ended august  net sales operating profit operating profit fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal industrial segment net sales increased by million to million  the result of strong industrial tool demand across most geographies 
excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates million  core sales growth for fiscal was 
growth innovation initiatives  including targeted vertical market strategies mining  industrial  infrastructure and increased global demand for heavy lift and hydraulic systems integrated solutions  also contributed to sales growth 
these higher sales volumes  operational efficiencies  favorable product mix and lower incentive compensation costs resulted in operating profit margin expansion during fiscal operating profit was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a million increase 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal industrial segment net sales increased by million to million 
the acquisition of two integrated solutions businesses hydrospex and team hydrotec contributed million of sales for the twelve months ended august  excluding sales from these acquisitions and the favorable impact of the weaker us dollar million  core sales grew in fiscal in addition to generally improved macroeconomic conditions  the increased sales were the result of new product introductions and increased demand from end users in the mining  oil gas and general maintenance industries 
industrial segment operating profit increased to million for the year ended august  compared to million in fiscal fiscal operating profit comparisons were favorably impacted by increased sales volumes and a million reduction in restructuring costs 
the expansion of the industrial segment operating profit margin  despite unfavorable acquisition mix and additional costs associated with growth initiatives  was the result of a lower cost structure from past restructuring actions and increased production levels higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
energy segment worldwide requirements for energy and supportive oil prices have encouraged energy segment customers and asset owners to invest in capital projects  improve output and efficiencies and complete previously deferred maintenance activities 
as a result  we have experienced broad based strength across this segment which generated year over year double digit core sales growth throughout fiscal the following table sets forth summary results of operations for the energy segment in millions year ended august  net sales operating profit operating profit fiscal compared to fiscal energy segment net sales for the fiscal year ended august  increased million to million from million a year ago 
excluding million of sales from the jeyco acquisition in and 
table of contents the impact of foreign currency rate changes which unfavorably impacted sales by million  core sales grew in the core sales growth reflects market share gains and continued strong demand for our products  rental assets and technical manpower services across the global energy market 
energy segment operating profit increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the year over year improvement in operating profit margins is primarily the result of continued productivity improvements  increased operating leverage driven by higher sales volumes  reduced incentive compensation costs and a favorable million adjustment to an acquisition earn out provision 
fiscal compared to fiscal energy segment net sales in fiscal were million  a million increase over the prior year 
excluding sales from acquired businesses and foreign currency changes which favorably impacted fiscal sales by million  core sales increased during fiscal this increase was the result of higher activity levels across nearly all of the segment s primary markets including capital project activity in the oil gas market  maintenance related spending in north america and emerging markets and strong sales to the power generation market 
energy segment operating profit increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the year over year increase in operating profit margins is primarily the result of continued productivity improvements and significantly increased operating leverage  a million reduction in restructuring charges and favorable acquisition mix  partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs 
electrical segment during fiscal  many of the end markets within the electrical segment recovered modestly from recessionary lows 
these improved end market conditions and certain pricing actions resulted in the electrical segment delivering core sales growth for the fiscal year 
this segment continues to focus on driving cost savings from the recently completed manufacturing facility consolidation and being responsive to end market demand including changes in european solar feed in tariffs and end market demand in north america 
the following table sets forth the summary results of operations for the electrical segment in millions year ended august  net sales operating profit loss adjusted operating profit adjusted operating profit excludes fiscal non cash asset impairment charge of million 
fiscal compared to fiscal electrical segment net sales increased million in fiscal to million 
excluding increased sales from the mastervolt acquisition million and changes in foreign currency exchange rates  core sales grew in fiscal this was the result of price increases and modestly higher volumes in most sales channels 
the electrical segment generated a million operating loss in fiscal  compared to an operating profit of million in fiscal fiscal operating results were adversely impacted by a million non cash asset impairment charge related to the mastervolt business 
despite unfavorable acquisition mix  higher incentive compensation costs and million of restructuring costs incurred to consolidate transformer manufacturing facilities  adjusted operating profit margins expanded as a result of pricing actions  cost saving initiatives and favorable product mix 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal electrical segment net sales increased by million to million in fiscal  with million of sales growth due to the mastervolt acquisition in december excluding mastervolt sales and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates  core sales were flat with fiscal electrical segment operating profit increased by million  to million in fiscal excluding restructuring costs  operating profit margins declined in fiscal primarily due to unfavorable mix resulting from the mastervolt acquisition 
engineered solutions segment the engineered solutions segment experienced a core sales decline in fiscal  reflecting lower production rates by truck and automotive oems 
despite strong demand during the first half of fiscal  growth rates have since moderated in the global agriculture and north american truck and construction equipment end markets as major oems reduce production schedules 
this segment continues to focus on integrating the recently acquired turotest and crosscontrol acquisitions and reducing its cost structure in line with reduced oem build rates 
the following table sets forth summary results of operations for the engineered solutions segment in millions year ended august  net sales operating profit operating profit fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in the engineered solutions segment increased million to million in fiscal excluding the million of sales from acquired businesses and the impact of the weaker euro which unfavorably impacted sales by million  core sales declined from the prior year 
the core sales decline reflects sharply lower demand and reduced production schedules from vehicle oem s serving the convertible top auto and european and china heavy duty truck markets 
engineered solutions segment operating profit was million during fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
segment operating profit declined from the prior year period  primarily the result of sales declines in some of its more profitable product lines  such as automotive and cab tilt trucks 
fiscal compared to fiscal engineered solutions segment net sales increased by million to million in fiscal excluding the million favorable impact of foreign currency rate changes and million of sales from acquired businesses  core sales increased in fiscal this growth reflects improved demand from vehicle oems in the global heavy duty truck  agriculture and construction equipment markets 
engineered solutions segment operating profit increased by million from an operating profit of million in fiscal to million for fiscal  primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable fixed cost leverage 
restructuring charges in fiscal and  in response to the dramatic downturn in the worldwide economy  we committed to various restructuring initiatives including workforce reductions  plant consolidations to reduce manufacturing capacity  the continued movement of production and product sourcing to low cost countries and the centralization of certain selling and administrative functions 
these actions were substantially completed by august   with limited restructuring activity and expense in fiscal and total restructuring costs were million  
table of contents million and million for the years ended august   and  respectively 
restructuring charges in fiscal primarily relate to the closure of an electrical segment manufacturing facility  including related severance and asset write downs 
we believe these restructuring actions better align our resources with strategic growth opportunities  optimize existing manufacturing capabilities  improve our overall cost structure and deliver increased free cash flow and profitability 
impairment charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized a million non cash asset impairment charge related to the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets tradename of the mastervolt business 
the impairment was the result of business underperformance since its acquisition  reduced long term mastervolt profit and cash flow expectations  as well as weaker economic and credit conditions in europe 
while we believe the solar industry will continue to grow globally  we have reduced our long term profitability expectations for mastervolt see note  impairment charges for further information 
financing costs  net all debt is considered to be for general corporate purposes and therefore financing costs have not been allocated to our segments 
net financing costs were million for the year ending august  and million for each of the years ended august  and the reduction in interest expense in fiscal reflects the conversion of our convertible notes into common stock  as well as the benefit of lower borrowing costs including the benefit of refinancing our senior notes 
income tax expense our income tax expense is impacted by a number of factors  including the amount of taxable earnings derived in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that are lower than the us federal statutory rate  state tax rates in the jurisdictions where we do business  tax minimization planning and our ability to utilize various tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
income tax expense also includes the impact of provision to return adjustments and changes in valuation allowances and reserve requirements for unrecognized tax benefits 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was excluding the debt refinancing and impairment charges  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
discontinued operations discontinued operations includes the results of the divested european electrical business which was sold in fiscal see note  discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations in millions year ended august  net sales net loss on disposal loss from operations of discontinued business income tax expense benefit loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax includes non cash asset impairment charge of million european electrical in fiscal 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the cash flow attributable to operating  investing and financing activities in millions year ended august  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities in fiscal were a record million  the result of strong cash earnings and effective working capital management  which were partially offset by the use of million of cash related to the debt refinancing 
this operating cash flow and the proceeds from the debt refinancing funded million of share repurchases  million of business acquisitions and the repayment of revolving credit facility borrowings 
proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment which included the sale leaseback of certain equipment and the sale of a vacant facility were million  while related capital expenditures were million 
during fiscal we generated million of cash flow from operations due to increased earnings from continuing operations and effective working capital management 
we utilized this cash flow  borrowings under our senior credit facility and the million of proceeds from the sale of the european electrical business to fund million of acquisitions mastervolt and weasler and million of capital expenditures 
in fiscal  cash flows from operating activities totaled million 
excluding the million negative impact on working capital due to the expiration of our accounts receivable securitization program  net cash provided by operating activities increased relative to the prior year as a result of increased earnings from continuing operations  effective working capital management and the receipt of income tax refunds 
this cash flow and the million of proceeds from the sale of a portion of the european electrical product line funded million of acquisitions  million of capital expenditures and million of net debt repayments 
primary working capital management we use primary working capital pwc as a percentage of sales as a key indicator of working capital management 
we define this metric as the sum of net accounts receivable and net inventory less accounts payable  divided by the past three months sales annualized 
the following table shows the components of the metric amounts in millions august  august  pwc pwc accounts receivable  net inventory  net accounts payable net primary working capital 
table of contents liquidity our senior credit facility  which matures on february   includes a million revolving credit facility  a million term loan and a million expansion option 
quarterly principal payments of million began on the million term loan on march   increasing to million per quarter beginning on march   with the remaining principal due at maturity 
at august   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of unused capacity on the revolver all of which was available for borrowings 
we believe that the availability under the senior credit facility  combined with our existing cash on hand and anticipated operating cash flows will be adequate to meet operating  debt service  stock buyback  acquisition funding and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
see note  debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the senior credit facility 
seasonality and working capital we have met our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of operating cash flow and availability under our senior credit facility 
although there are modest seasonal factors within certain of our businesses  on a consolidated basis  we do not experience material changes in seasonal working capital or capital resource requirements 
our receivables are derived from a diverse customer base in a number of industries 
we have no single customer which generated or more of fiscal net sales 
capital expenditures the majority of our manufacturing activities consist of the assembly of components which are sourced from a variety of vendors 
as a result  we believe that our capital expenditure requirements are not as extensive as many other industrial companies given the assembly nature of our operations 
capital expenditures which have historically been funded by operating cash flows were million in both fiscal  and million in fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million 
commitments and contingencies we lease certain facilities  computers  equipment and vehicles under various operating lease agreements  generally over periods ranging from one to twenty years 
under most arrangements  we pay the property taxes  insurance  maintenance and expenses related to the leased property 
many of the leases include provisions that enable us to renew the lease based upon fair value rental rates on the date of expiration of the initial lease 
see note  leases  in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the contractual obligations table below for further information 
we are contingently liable for certain lease agreements entered into by businesses that were part of our former electronics segment  which was spun off to shareholders in fiscal some of these businesses were subsequently sold to third parties 
if any of these businesses do not fulfill their obligations under the leases  we could be liable for such leases 
the present value of future minimum lease payments for these leases was million at august  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million and million at august  and  respectively  the majority of which secure self insured workers compensation liabilities 

table of contents contractual obligations the timing of payments due under our contractual commitments is as follows in millions payments due thereafter total long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases acquisition purchase price payable the above table includes deferred purchase price and contingent consideration related to acquisitions completed in fiscal and previous years 
our operating lease obligations generally relate to amounts due under contracts with third party service providers 
these contracts are primarily for real estate leases  information technology services including software and hardware support services and leases and telecommunications services 
those obligations that are not cancelable are included in the table 
we routinely issue purchase orders to numerous vendors for inventory and other supplies 
these purchase orders are generally cancelable with reasonable notice to the vendor  and as such  are excluded from the contractual obligations table 
we have long term obligations related to our deferred compensation  pension and postretirement plans at august  excluded from the contractual obligations table 
our liabilities related to these plans are summarized in note  employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have unrecognized tax benefits of million at august  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was not included in the table of contractual obligations because the timing of the potential settlements of these uncertain tax positions cannot be reasonably estimated 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following policies are considered by management to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method for a portion of us owned inventory approximately and of total inventories at august  and  respectively 
the first in  first out or average cost method is used for all other inventories 
if the lifo method were not used  the inventory balance would be higher than the amount in the consolidated balance sheet by approximately million at august  and million at august  we perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value 
the inventory valuation assumptions used are based on historical experience 
we believe that such estimates are made based on consistent and appropriate methods  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
goodwill and long lived assets our business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets  which are a significant portion of our total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense 
table of contents and impairment charges that we could incur in future periods 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if triggering events occur  we compare the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss  if any  is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the estimated fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms length basis 
in estimating the fair value  we use a discounted cash flow model  which is dependent on a number of assumptions including estimated future revenues and expenses  weighted average cost of capital  capital expenditures and other variables 
indefinite lived intangible assets are also subject to annual impairment testing 
on an annual basis  the fair value of the indefinite lived assets  based on a relief of royalty income approach  are evaluated to determine if an impairment charge is required 
we also review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
if such indicators are present  we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests  principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit and the indefinite lived intangible assets 
while we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable  different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and  therefore  impairment charges could be required 
refer to note  discontinued operations and note  impairment charges in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on impairment charges 
employee benefit plans we provide a variety of benefits to employees and former employees  including in some cases  pensions and postretirement health care 
plan assets and obligations are recorded based on an august measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return and health care cost trend rates 
we determine the discount rate assumptions by referencing high quality long term bond rates that are matched to the duration of our benefit obligations  with appropriate consideration of local market factors  participant demographics and benefit payment terms 
at august  and  the weighted average discount rate on domestic benefit plans was and  respectively 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  we consider the historical returns on plan assets  forward looking considerations  inflation assumptions and the impact of the management of the plans invested assets 
domestic benefit plan assets consist primarily of participating units in mutual funds  index funds and bond funds 
the expected return on domestic benefit plan assets was and at august  and  respectively 
a basis point change in the assumptions for the discount rate or expected return on plan assets would not materially change fiscal domestic benefit plan expense 
we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods 
based on information provided by independent actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable  however  changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note  employee benefit plans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
income tax expense also reflects best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other things  the level of future taxable income and the effect of various tax planning strategies 
future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws  changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded 
table of contents use of estimates we record reserves or allowances for customer rebates  returns and discounts  doubtful accounts  inventory  incurred but not reported medical claims  environmental matters  warranty claims  workers compensation claims  product and non product litigation and incentive compensation 
these reserves require the use of estimates and judgment 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that such estimates are made on a consistent basis and with appropriate assumptions and methods 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates
