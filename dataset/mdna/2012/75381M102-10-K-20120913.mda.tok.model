conversion factors and abbreviations all units in this annual report are stated in metric measurements unless otherwise noted 
for ease of reference  the following conversion factors are provided to convert imperial measurement units to metric measurement units multiply by acres hectares feet meters miles kilometers tons short tonnes gallons liters ounces troy grams ounces troy per ton short grams per tonne glossary of terms we report our mineral reserves under two separate standards to meet the requirements for reporting in both canada and the united states 
canadian reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by national instrument ni 
the definitions in ni are adopted from those given by the canadian institute of mining  metallurgy and petroleum cim 
us reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by the securities and exchange commission sec industry guide these reporting standards have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of confidence in the disclosures being reported  but embody differing approaches and definitions 
we estimate and report our mineral resources and mineral reserves according to the definitions set forth in ni and modify them as appropriate to conform to sec industry guide for reporting in the us the definitions for each reporting standard are presented below with supplementary explanation and descriptions of the similarities and differences 
ni definitions mineral reserve the term mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
the study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction can be justified 
a mineral reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined 
proven mineral reserve the term proven mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
this study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified 
probable mineral reserve the term probable mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of an indicated  and in some circumstances  a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
this study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified 
mineral resource the term mineral resource refers to a concentration or occurrence of diamonds  natural solid inorganic material  or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals  coal  rare earth elements and industrial minerals in or on the earth s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction 
the location  quantity  grade  geological characteristics and continuity of a mineral resource are known  estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge 
measured mineral resource the term measured mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity  grade or quality  densities  shape and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters  to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit 
the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration  sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity 
indicated mineral resource the term indicated mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity  grade or quality  densities  shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters  to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit 
the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pour  workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed 
inferred mineral resource the term inferred mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed  but not verified  geological and grade continuity 
the estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pour  workings and drill holes 
qualified person the term qualified person refers to an individual who is an engineer or geoscientist with at least five years of experience in mineral exploration  mine development or operation or mineral project assessment  or any combination of these  has experience relevant to the subject matter of the mineral project and the technical report and is a member in good standing of a professional association 
sec industry guide definitions reserve the term reserve refers to that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
reserves must be supported by a feasibility study done to bankable standards that demonstrates the economic extraction 
bankable standards implies that the confidence attached to the costs and achievements developed in the study is sufficient for the project to be eligible for external debt financing 
a reserve includes adjustments to the in situ tonnes and grade to include diluting materials and allowances for losses that might occur when the material is mined 
proven reserve the term proven reserve refers to reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable reserve the term probable reserve refers to reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
mineralized material the term mineralized material refers to material that is not included in the reserve as it does not meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or legal extraction 
non reserves the term non reserves refers to mineralized material that is not included in the reserve as it does not meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or legal extraction 
exploration stage an exploration stage prospect is one which is not in either the development or production stage 
development stage a development stage project is one which is undergoing preparation of an established commercially mineable deposit for ore extraction but which is not yet in production 
this stage occurs after completion of a feasibility study 
production stage a production stage project is actively engaged in the process of extraction and beneficiation of mineral reserves to produce a marketable metal or mineral product 
industry guide does not require designation of qualified person 
for industry guide purposes the feasibility study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified 
this category is substantially equivalent to the combined categories of measured mineral resource and indicated mineral resource specified in ni additional definitions assay a measure of the valuable mineral content bastnasite a mixed lanthanide fluoro carbonate mineral ln f co that currently provides the bulk of the world s supply of the light rees 
bastnasite and monazite are the two most common sources of cerium and other rees 
bastnasite is found in carbonatites  igneous carbonate rocks that melt at unusually low temperatures cerium ce a soft  silvery  ductile metal which easily oxidizes in air 
cerium is the most abundant of the rees  and is found in a number of minerals  including monazite and bastnasite 
cerium has two relatively stable oxidation states  enabling both the storage of oxygen and its widespread use in catalytic converters 
cerium is also widely used in glass polish concentrate a mineral processing product that generally describes the material that is produced after crushing and grinding ore  effecting significant separation of gangue waste minerals from the desired metal and or metal minerals  and discarding the waste minerals 
the resulting concentrate of minerals typically has an order of magnitude higher content of minerals than the beginning ore material cut off grade when determining economically viable mineral reserves  the lowest grade of mineralized material that qualifies as ore  ie that can be mined and processed at a profit definitive feasibility study dfs a comprehensive study of a mineral deposit in which all geological  engineering  legal  operating  economic  social  environmental and other relevant factors are considered in sufficient detail that it could reasonably serve as the basis for a final decision by a financial institution to finance the development of the deposit for mineral production dysprosium dy a few percent of dysprosium dy is often added to high power neodymium iron boron magnets to increase their resistance to demagnetization 
a minor use of dysprosium is in the magnetostrictive alloy  based on dytbfe called terfenol d europium eu desirable due to its photon emission 
excitation of the europium atom  by absorption of electrons or by uv radiation  results in changes in energy levels that create a visible emission 
almost all practical uses of europium utilize this luminescent behavior fault a surface or zone of rock fracture along which there has been displacement formation a distinct layer of sedimentary rock of similar composition gadolinium gd absorbs neutrons and therefore is used for shielding and controlling neutron radiography and in nuclear reactors 
because of its paramagnetic properties  solutions of organic gadolinium complexes and gadolinium compounds are popular intravenous contrast enhancing agents for medical magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents in mri 
gadolinium is sometimes added to samarium cobalt magnets to make their magnetic properties less temperature dependent geochemical the distribution and amounts of the chemical elements in minerals  ores  rocks  solids  water  and the atmosphere geophysical the mechanical  electrical  gravitational and magnetic properties of the earth s crust geophysical surveys a survey method used primarily in the mining industry as an exploration tool  applying the methods of physics and engineering to the earth s surface grade quantity of metal per unit weight of host rock heavy rare earth elements hrees defined as the elements tb  dy  ho  er  tm  yb  ly and y host rock the rock in which a mineral or an ore body may be contained lanthanum la the first member of the lanthanide series 
lanthanum is a strategically important rare earth element due to its use in fluid bed cracking catalysts  fccs  which are used in the production of transportation and aircraft fuel 
lanthanum is also used in fuel cells and batteries 
life of mine a term commonly used to refer to the likely term of a mining operation and normally determined by dividing the tonnes of mineral reserve by the annual rate of mining and processing mineral a naturally occurring inorganic crystalline material having a definite chemical composition mineralization a natural accumulation or concentration in rocks or soil of one or more potentially economic minerals  also the process by which minerals are introduced or concentrated in a rock monazite a reddish brown phosphate mineral 
monazite minerals are typically accompanied by concentrations of uranium and thorium 
this has historically limited the processing of monazite  however this mineral is becoming more attractive because it typically has elevated concentrations of mid to heavy rare earths national instrument ni standards of disclosure for mineral projects prescribed by the canadian securities administration neodymium nd key constituent of ndfeb permanent magnets and it is an additive to capacitor dielectrics 
ndfeb magnets maximize the power weight ratio  and are found in a large variety of motors  generators  sensors and hard disk drives 
capacitors containing neodymium are found in cellular telephones  computers and nearly all other electronic devices 
a minor application of neodymium is in lasers open pit surface mining in which the ore is extracted from a pit or quarry  the geometry of the pit may vary with the characteristics of the ore body ore mineral bearing rock that can be mined and treated profitably under current or immediately foreseeable economic conditions ore body a mostly solid and fairly continuous mass of mineralization estimated to be economically mineable ore grade the average weight of the valuable metal or mineral contained in a specific weight of ore ie grams per tonne of ore oxide rare earth bearing ore which results from the oxidation of near surface sulfide ore preliminary economic assessment pea a study that includes an economic analysis of the potential viability of mineral resources taken at an early stage of the project prior to the completion of a preliminary feasibility study praseodymium pr comprises about of the lanthanide content of bastnasite and has a few specific applications  based mainly on its optical properties 
it is a common coloring pigment  and is used in photographic filters  airport signal lenses  and welder s glasses 
because it chemically and magnetically is so similar to its neighbors neodymium and lanthanum  it is typically found in small amounts in applications where neodymium and lanthanum are popular  such as ndfeb magnets and catalysts 
these latter applications are actually the largest uses for praseodymium because the magnet and catalyst markets are so large 
thus praseodymium plays an important role  in extending the availability of the more popular neodymium and lanthanum preliminary feasibility study or pre feasibility study pfs each mean a comprehensive study of the viability of a mineral project that has advanced to a stage where the mining method  in the case of underground mining  or the pit configuration in the case of an open pit  has been established and an effective method of mineral processing has been determined  and includes a financial analysis based on reasonable assumptions of technical  engineering  legal  operating  economic  social  and environmental factors and the evaluation of other relevant factors which are sufficient for a qualified person  acting reasonably  to determine if all or part of the mineral resource may be classified as a mineral reserve rare earth element ree an unusual group of metallic elements with unique properties chemical  catalytic  magnetic  metallurgical and phosphorescent rare earth oxide reo the oxide form of rare earth elements rc reverse circulation drilling a drilling method using a tri cone bit  during which rock cuttings are pushed from the bottom of the drill hole to the surface through an outer tube  by liquid and or air pressure moving through an inner tube recovery the percentage of contained metal actually extracted from ore in the course of processing such ore samarium sm predominantly used to produce samarium cobalt magnets 
although these magnets are slightly less powerful than ndfeb magnets at room temperature  samarium cobalt magnets can be used over a wider range of temperatures and are less susceptible to corrosion 
sampling and analytical variance precision an estimate of the total error induced by sampling  sample preparation and analysis strike the direction or trend that a structural surface  eg a bedding or fault plane  takes as it intersects the horizontal strip to remove overburden in order to expose ore sulfide a mineral including sulfur s and iron fe as well as other elements  metallic sulfur bearing mineral often associated with ree mineralization tailings fine ground wet waste material produced from ore after economically recoverable metals or minerals have been extracted total rare earth oxide treo refers to the sum total of rare earth elements present in a deposit vein a thin  sheet like crosscutting body of hydrothermal mineralization  principally quartz part i item description of business corporate background rare element resources ltd

description of business our business is the exploration and development of mineral properties 
our principal property is the bear lodge property located in northeastern wyoming  usa 
the bear lodge property consists of two projects  the main project which is the bear lodge rare earth element project bear lodge ree project and the sundance gold project 
the bear lodge ree project contains a large disseminated ree deposit which is the second highest grade ree deposit in north america  has an encouraging distribution of the elements nd  pr  eu  tb and dy 
the bear lodge ree project has favorable metallurgy  outstanding infrastructure  and it is located in one of the world s best mining jurisdictions  recently globally ranked fourth by the fraser institute 
further description of the acquisition of the above properties is included under the section heading item properties in this annual report 
recent corporate developments the following significant corporate developments occurred during our fiscal year ended june  completed the drilling program on the bear lodge ree project in december the program included exploration and development drill holes and an additional large diameter core holes 
the large diameter core holes provided a ton bulk sample for an upcoming pilot plant metallurgical test work in incorporated partial results from the ree drilling program into an updated mineral resource estimate for a preliminary feasibility study pfs that shows positive economics using three year trailing average prices for ree concentrates  an upgraded and increased ni compliant mineral resource estimate  based on complete results from the drilling program  was announced on may  completed a hole gold exploration drilling program in november on the sundance gold project focusing on three main gold targets 
results from the drilling at the smith target provided the highest gold grades found to date 
identified hree enrichment in mineralization at the whitetail ridge resource  and the  east taylor and carbon target areas 
the strongest hree enrichment and highest grades occur at the east taylor target within the bear lodge ree project 
continued environmental baseline and geotechnical studies for use in the environmental impact study eis and definitive feasibility study 
trends and description of the rare earth market uses for ree products rees are used in hybrid electric vehicles and all electric vehicles  many of which contain ree bearing nickel metal hydride batteries and ree super magnets within electrical motors and generators  ree are also used in computers  cellular telephones  tv screens  wind turbines  fuel cells  magnetic refrigeration technologies  compact fluorescent lights  petroleum refining catalysts and numerous other modern specialty technologies 
the markets for ree have become more significant in recent years as more of these new technologies are developed 
prices of rees are affected by the supply and demand fundamentals of the market 
trends affecting supplies of ree products currently ree markets are dominated by production from china  which produced approximately of the global ree production in for the past eight years and most recently in the summer of  china has reduced its exports of rees by percent and increased related export taxes  which has significantly increased ree prices since that time 
global supply is expected to remain limited due to continued chinese export restrictions  consolidation of the chinese small rare earth producers  increased chinese environmental protections and expected continued demand increases 
as a result of increased investment in the rare earth industry outside of china  there are several new and refurbished rare earth projects about to begin producing rare earth products 
new production is expected to ramp up beginning in the fourth quarter of and continue through this new production may have a negative impact on the pricing of some rare earth products  especially lanthanum and cerium 
trends affecting demand of ree products the global economy plays a key role in the continuation and pace of increased demand 
if the global economy experiences a prolonged period of slow growth  then the expected increase in rare earth product demand may not increase at the pace expected 
since rees are used for many new technologies  it is estimated that the demand for ree will increase at a rate of to percent per year for the next to years and possibly longer 
rare earth magnet demand using nd  pr  dy  sm and tb is expected to increase annually at a rate of to 
trends affecting prices of ree products the prices of rees are quoted in different forms  including rare earth carbonate concentrates that contain approximately percent to percent treos  which can be marketed and sold in such form 
rees more commonly can be separated into individual oxides and sold or are sold in small sub groups of similar elements 
according to www 
metal pages 
com metal pages  the prices of rees increased approximately  to  percent  depending on the element  from july to august  and then prices began decreasing through the end of for example  according to metal pages  the prices of ree carbonate concentrates increased from  per metric tonne kg in early july to approximately  per tonne kg in october through december ree carbonate concentrate prices remained steady at per kilogram throughout reo prices of individual oxides increased considerably during the first two quarters of but declined in the third and fourth quarters 
beginning in the second quarter of  ree prices have decreased significantly for all rees 
lanthanum and cerium decreased from highs exceeding per kilogram in mid to less than per kilogram for oxide fob china currently 
supply and demand factors for ree products that could positively impact ree prices the use of neodymium  praseodymium  terbium and dysprosium in high strength ndfeb magnets that are critical to hybrid and electric vehicles and the increased construction of wind power generation facilities  particularly off shore installations  the use of lanthanum and cerium for nimh batteries that are utilized in hybrid and electric vehicles  the use of europium  terbium and yttrium in the production of compact fluorescent light bulbs  the use of high strength ndfeb magnets in the miniaturization of electronic products  the use of lanthanum in fluid cracking catalysts by refineries processing lower quality crude oil that consumes greater quantities of the catalysts  the increased use of rees in the drive to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas  or ghgs  by the united states and the european union  china is consolidating its ree industry and closing small  inefficient and polluting ree producers  the stockpiling of certain ree products and increases in export taxes by china  the use of cerium in glass  ceramics  glass polishing  and advanced water filtration applications  and continued research and commercialization of new applications for ree products 
supply and demand factors for ree products that could negatively impact ree prices the potential for oversupply of certain rees due to new production or increased exports by china  the potential substitution of other materials for high priced rees  static or lower global growth reducing demand for rees  and production and processing methodology and costs exceeding market prices 
our ability to raise additional funds in order to complete our plan to develop the bear lodge ree property may be impacted by future prices of ree 
the marketability of our common shares and our ability to raise other sources of financing will be dependent on the prices of ree 
if the global demand for rees decreases it could adversely impair our ability to obtain financing at reasonable terms in order to fund the exploration and future development of our mineral properties 
seasonality seasonality in the state of wyoming is not a material factor to our operations for our project 
snow fall in the winter can limit our access to the bear lodge property and our ability to drill from approximately november through june  but it is not a material issue for us 
competition the industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
we compete with other mining and exploration companies in connection with the acquisition  exploration and development of mineral properties 
there is competition for the limited number of mineral property acquisition opportunities  some of which is with other companies having substantially greater financial resources  staff and facilities than we do 
as a result  we may have difficulty acquiring attractive exploration properties  staking claims related to the bear lodge property  and exploring and developing the bear lodge property 
we also compete with other mining and exploration companies in our efforts to hire and retain experienced mining professionals 
competition for exploration resources at all levels is currently very intense  particularly affecting the availability of manpower  drill rigs  mining equipment and production equipment 
as a result  we may have difficulty attracting or retaining key personnel or outside technical resources 
china accounts for the vast majority of ree production 
while ree projects exist outside of china  very few are in actual production 
further  even though several large mines outside of china are expected to be in production soon  it is likely that the chinese will be able to dominate the market for rare earth elements into the future 
this gives the chinese a competitive advantage in controlling the supply of rare earth elements and engaging in competitive price reductions to discourage competition 
any increase in the amount of rare earth elements exported from other nations  and increased competition  may result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of potential market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our profitability 
as a result of these factors  the company may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors 
environmental regulation our exploration and development activities are subject to extensive and costly environmental laws and regulations under various federal  state  county and local laws relating to the protection of the environment  which generally includes air and water quality  hazardous waste management and reclamation 
environmental hazards may exist on the properties in which we hold interests which are unknown to us at present and which have been caused by previous owners of the properties 
environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that will require stricter standards and enforcement  increased fines and penalties for non compliance  more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers  directors and employees 
current and future laws  regulations and permits will impose significant costs  liabilities or obligations or could limit or prevent our ability to continue operations or undertake new operations 
our bear lodge property in wyoming is subject to federal and state environmental laws  regulations  and permits 
the federal agency involved with compliance is the united states forest service  sundance  wyoming district office 
the state agency involved is the wyoming department of environmental quality 
we operate under permits granted by these two agencies and have established bonds to ensure environmental reclamation of areas disturbed 
as of june   the company had reclamation bonds totaling  minerals exploration regulation mining operations and exploration and development activities are subject to various national  state  county and local laws and regulations in the united states  which govern prospecting  development  mining  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  protection of the environment  mine safety  hazardous substances and other matters 
the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining  health  safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder in the united states 
there are no current orders or notices of violations relating to the company with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations 
compliance with these laws and regulations may impose substantial costs on the company and will subject it to significant potential liabilities 
changes in these laws or regulations could require us to expend significant resources to comply with new laws or regulations or changes to current requirements and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 
mine safety and health administration regulations pursuant to section a of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  issuers that are operators  or that have a subsidiary that is an operator  of a coal or other mine in the united states are required to disclose in their periodic reports filed with the sec information regarding specified health and safety violations  orders and citations  related assessments and legal actions  and mining related fatalities 
during the fiscal year ended june   our bear lodge property was not subject to regulation by the federal mine safety and health administration msha under the federal mine safety and health act of the mine act

item a 
risk factors the following sets forth certain risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and or results of operations  and the trading price of our common shares which may decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully address these risks or that other unknown risks exist that may affect our business 
we have a history of losses and will require additional financing to fund exploration and  if warranted  development and production 
failure to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation and could cast uncertainty on our ability to continue as a going concern 
for the fiscal year ended june   our net loss was million 
our accumulated deficit at june  was million 
at june   our cash position was million  of which million was considered cash and cash equivalents and million was held as short term investments 
our working capital position was million 
we have not commenced commercial production on any of our mineral properties 
we have no revenues from operations  and we anticipate we will have no operating revenues until we place the bear lodge property into production 
our bear lodge property is currently in the exploration stage 
we do not have sufficient funds to fully complete exploration and development work on the bear lodge property  which means that we will be required to raise additional capital  enter into joint venture relationships or find alternative means to finance the placing of our bear lodge property into commercial production 
failure to obtain sufficient financing may result in the delay or indefinite postponement of exploration and development or production on our bear lodge property and any properties we may acquire in the future or even a loss of property interests 
we cannot be certain that additional capital or other types of financing will be available if needed or that  if available  the terms of such financing will be favorable or acceptable to us 
future financings may cause dilution to our shareholders 
our ability to arrange additional financing in the future will depend  in part  on the prevailing capital market conditions as well as our business performance 
we are an exploration stage company and have no history producing metals from our properties 
any future revenues and profits are uncertain 
we have no history of mining or refining any mineral products or metals and none of our properties is currently producing 
there can be no assurance that the bear lodge property will be successfully placed into production  produce minerals in commercial quantities or otherwise generate operating earnings 
advancing properties from the exploration stage into development and commercial production requires significant capital and time and will be subject to further feasibility studies  permitting requirements and construction of the mine  processing plants  roads and related works and infrastructure 
we will continue to incur losses until our mining activities successfully reach commercial production levels and generate sufficient revenue to fund continuing operations 
there is no certainty that we will produce revenue from any source  operate profitably or provide a return on investment in the future 
if we are unable to generate revenues or profits  our shareholders might not be able to realize returns on their investment in our common shares 
the planned development of our bear lodge property involves numerous uncertainties that could affect the feasibility or profitability of such project 
mine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible 
development projects are subject to the completion of successful feasibility studies and environmental and socioeconomic assessments  the issuance of necessary governmental permits and receipt of adequate financing 
the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors such as completion of definitive feasibility studies to further verify mineral reserves and mineral resources and commercial viability  the timing and cost  which can be considerable  of further exploration  preparing feasibility studies  permitting and construction of infrastructure  mining and processing facilities  securing a commercially viable sales outlet for our products  the availability and costs of drill equipment  skilled labor and mining and processing equipment  if required  the availability and cost of appropriate processing and or refining arrangements  if required  compliance with environmental and other governmental approval and permit requirements  the availability of funds to finance exploration  development and construction activities  as warranted  negotiating sales or off take contracts for our planned production  future ree and gold prices  potential opposition from non governmental organizations  environmental groups or local groups or inhabitants which may delay or prevent development activities  potential increases in exploration  construction and operating costs due to changes in the cost of fuel  power  materials and supplies  and potential shortages of mineral processing  construction and other facilities related supplies 
it is common in exploration programs and  if warranted  development  construction and mine start up to experience unexpected problems and delays 
accordingly  our activities may not result in profitable mining operations and we may not succeed in establishing mining operations or profitably producing metals at our bear lodge property 
our growth depends on the exploration  permitting  development and operation of our bear lodge ree project  which is our only rare earth project 
our only rare earth exploration property at this time is our bear lodge ree project 
our continued viability is based on successfully implementing our strategy  including completion of a definitive feasibility study  permitting and construction of a mine and processing facilities in an expected timeframe 
the deterioration or destruction of any part of our property may significantly hinder our ability to maintain a sustainable or profitable business 
increased costs could affect our ability to bring our projects into production and once in production  to be profitable 
we have estimated the capital costs required to bring the bear lodge ree project into commercial production in our pfs 
our actual costs may be higher than we presently anticipate which could make it more difficult to finance the project or to successfully establish mining operations at the bear lodge ree project 
we anticipate that our future operating costs at the bear lodge property will frequently be subject to variation from one year to the next due to a number of factors  such as changing ore grade  metallurgy and revisions to mine plans  in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body 
in addition  costs are affected by the price of commodities such as fuel  rubber  and electricity 
such commodities are at times subject to volatile price movements  including increases that could make production less profitable or not profitable at all 
a material increase in costs could also impact our ability to maintain operations 
we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for  and prices of  rare earth products 
because our primary focus currently is the exploration and development of the bear lodge ree project  changes in demand for  and the market price of  ree and related products could significantly affect our ability to develop and finance the bear lodge ree project and eventually attain commercial production and profitability 
the value and price of our common shares may be adversely affected by declines in the prices of ree and related products 
ree and ree product prices may fluctuate and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control such as interest rates  exchange rates  inflation or deflation  fluctuation in the relative value of the us dollar against foreign currencies on the world market  global and regional supply and demand for ree and ree products  and the political and economic conditions of countries that produce ree 
as a result of the global economic crisis  ree prices declined by approximately between and the end of the third quarter of although ree prices increased during and most of  they experienced a significant drop again in the first eight months of average prices for lanthanum oxide and cerium oxide decreased by approximately during the second half of due  in part  to a reduction in reported speculative buying of rare earth materials in china 
protracted periods of low prices for ree and ree products could significantly reduce our ability to develop the bear lodge ree project or  if we attain commercial production  to maintain operations 
reduced ree prices could also reduce our mineral reserves and mineral resources 
demand for ree may be impacted by demand for downstream products incorporating rare earths  including hybrid and electric vehicles  wind power equipment and other clean technology products  as well as demand in the general automotive and electronic industries 
lack of growth in these markets may adversely affect the demand for ree products  which would have a material adverse effect on our bear lodge ree project and our business 
in contrast  extended periods of high commodity prices may create economic dislocations that may be destabilizing to rare earth minerals supply and demand and ultimately to the broader markets 
periods of high ree prices generally are beneficial to us  however  strong ree prices  as well as real or perceived disruptions in the supply of ree  also create economic pressure to identify or create alternate technologies that ultimately could depress future long term demand for ree and ree products  and at the same time may incentivize development of otherwise marginal mining properties 
for example  automobile manufacturers have recently announced plans to develop motors for electric and hybrid cars that do not require rare earth metals due to concerns about the available supply of rare earths 
if the automobile industry or other industries reduce their reliance on rare earth products  the resulting change in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business 
conditions in the rare earth industry have been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile  which could have a material impact on our company 
conditions in the rare earth industry have been extremely volatile  and prices  as well as supply and demand  have been significantly impacted by a number of factors  principally changes in economic conditions and demand for rare earth materials and changes  or perceived changes  in chinese quotas for export of rare earth materials 
dramatic price fluctuations are due  in part  to a reduction in reported speculative buying of rare earth materials in china 
if conditions in our industry remain volatile  our stock price may continue to exhibit volatility as well 
in particular  if prices or demand for rare earths were to decline  our stock price would likely decline  and this could also impair our ability to obtain capital needed for our bear lodge project and our ability to find purchasers for our products at prices acceptable to us 
an increase in the global supply of rare earth products  dumping and predatory pricing by our competitors may materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital  develop our bear lodge property and operate profitably 
the pricing and demand for ree products is affected by a number of factors beyond our control  including growth of economic development and the global supply and demand for reo products 
according to imcoa  it is estimated that china accounted for approximately of global reo production in china also dominates the manufacture of metals and ndfeb magnets from rare earths  a capacity that is not currently found in the united states 
once we reach production of reos  the increased competition may lead our competitors to engage in predatory pricing behavior or manipulation of the available supply of reos 
any increase in the amount of rare earth products exported from other nations and increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of potential market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our profitability 
as a result of these factors  we may not be able to compete effectively against our future competitors 
the success of our business will depend  in part  on the establishment of new uses and markets for rare earth products 
the success of our business will depend  in part  on the establishment of new markets by us or third parties for certain rare earth products that may be in low demand 
although we plan to produce rare earth products for use in end products such as ndfeb magnets  which are used in critical existing and emerging technologies such as hybrid and electric vehicles  wind power turbines and compact fluorescent lighting  the success of our business depends on creating new markets and successfully commercializing rare earth products in existing and emerging markets 
any unexpected costs or delays in the commercialization of any of the foregoing products and applications could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our bear lodge property and operate our business 
a shortage of equipment and supplies could adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
we are dependent on various supplies and equipment to carry out our exploration and  if warranted  development and mining operations 
the shortage of such supplies  equipment and parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to carry out our planned activities and increase our costs and expenses 
mining and mineral exploration and development are inherently dangerous and subject to conditions or events beyond our control  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and plans 
mining and mineral exploration involves various types of risks and hazards  including environmental hazards  power outages  metallurgical and other processing problems  unusual or unexpected geological formations  personal injury  flooding  fire  explosions  cave ins  landslides and rock bursts  metals losses  fluctuations in exploration  development and production costs  labor disputes  unanticipated variations in grade  mechanical equipment failure  and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions 
these risks could result in damage to  or destruction of  mineral properties  production facilities or other properties  personal injury  environmental damage  delays in mining  increased production costs  monetary losses and possible legal liability 
we may not be able to obtain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums 
insurance against certain environmental risks  including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of the disposal of waste products occurring from production  may be prohibitively expensive 
we may suffer a material adverse effect on our business if we incur losses related to any significant events that are not covered by insurance policies 
mineral exploration and development is highly speculative  and certain inherent exploration risks could have a negative effect on our business 
our long term success depends on our ability to identify mineral deposits on existing properties and other properties we may acquire  if any  that can then be developed into commercially viable mining operations 
resource exploration is a highly speculative business  characterized by a number of significant risks including  among other things  unprofitable efforts resulting not only from the failure to discover mineral deposits but from finding mineral deposits which  though present  are insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production 
substantial expenditures are required to establish proven and probable mineral reserves through drilling and analysis  to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal  and to develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining 
the marketability of minerals acquired or discovered by us may be affected by numerous factors which are beyond our control and which cannot be accurately predicted  such as market fluctuations  the proximity and capacity of milling facilities  mineral markets and processing equipment  and such other factors such as government regulations  including regulations relating to royalties  allowable production  importing and exporting of minerals  and environmental protection 
any one or a combination of these factors may result in our failure to receive an adequate return on our investment capital 
the decision to abandon a project may have an adverse effect on the market value of our common shares and our ability to raise future financing 
mineral resource estimates are based on interpretation and assumptions and may yield less mineral production under actual conditions than is currently estimated 
unless otherwise indicated  our mineral reserve and mineral resources estimates are based upon estimates made by independent geologists and our internal geologists 
when making determinations about whether to advance the bear lodge property to development  we must rely upon such estimated calculations as to the mineral reserves and grades of mineralization on the property 
until ore is actually mined and processed  mineral reserves and grades of mineralization must be considered as estimates only 
estimates can be imprecise and depend upon geological interpretation and statistical inferences drawn from drilling and sampling analysis  which may prove to be unreliable 
we cannot assure you that mineral resource or other mineralization estimates will be accurate  or that this mineralization can be mined or processed profitably 
our mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates could be inaccurate  and any material changes in these estimates will affect the economic viability of placing a property into production 
because we have not completed a definitive feasibility study on the bear lodge property and have not commenced actual production  mineralization estimates  including mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates  for the bear lodge property may require adjustments or downward revisions 
in addition  the grade of ore ultimately mined  if any  may differ from that indicated by any pre feasibility or definitive feasibility studies and drill results 
minerals recovered in small scale tests may not be duplicated in large scale tests under on site conditions or in production scale 
our mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates have been determined and valued based on assumed future prices  cut off grades and operating costs that may prove to be inaccurate 
extended declines in market prices for rees and gold may render portions of our mineral reserves or mineral resources uneconomic and result in reduced reported mineralization or adversely affect the commercial viability determinations reached by us 
any material reductions in estimates of mineralization  or of our ability to extract this mineralization  could have a material adverse effect on our share price and the value of our bear lodge property 
title to our bear lodge property may be subject to other claims  or we may lose our interest in our claims or lease with the state of wyoming  which could affect our property rights and claims 
there are risks that title to our bear lodge property may be challenged or impugned 
our bear lodge property is located in the state of wyoming and may be subject to prior unrecorded agreements or transfers or native land claims  and title may be affected by undetected defects 
there may be valid challenges to the title of our bear lodge property which  if successful  could impair development and or operations 
the vast majority of the mineral rights to our bear lodge property consist of unpatented mining claims created and maintained in accordance with the us general mining law 
unpatented mining claims are unique property interests  and are generally considered to be subject to greater title risk than other real property interests because the validity of unpatented mining claims is often uncertain 
this uncertainty arises  in part  out of the complex federal and state laws and regulations under the us general mining law 
also  unpatented mining claims are always subject to possible challenges by third parties or validity contests by the federal government 
the validity of an unpatented mining or mill site claim  in terms of both its location and its maintenance  is dependent on strict compliance with a complex body of us federal and state statutory and decisional law 
in addition  there are few public records that definitively determine the issues of validity and ownership of unpatented mining claims 
should the federal government impose a royalty or additional tax burdens on the properties that lie within public lands  the resulting mining operations could be seriously impacted  depending upon the type and amount of the burden 
the mining lease we hold through the state of wyoming is subject to payment obligations and renewals 
there is a risk that we may not be granted a renewal upon request to continue to hold the lease through the exploration and planned operation of the bear lodge property 
the royalty imposed by the state is subject to further definition and may also be an impediment to our exploration and planned operations  depending upon the burden that could be imposed 
the loss of the state of wyoming mining lease rights  or future royalties or taxes imposed by the state of wyoming  would adversely affect our property 
our operations are subject to significant uninsured risks that could negatively impact future profitability as we maintain limited insurance against our operations 
the exploration of our bear lodge property contain certain risks  including unexpected or unusual operating conditions including rock bursts  cave ins  flooding  fire and earthquakes 
it is not always possible to insure against these risks 
should events such as these arise  they could reduce or eliminate our assets and shareholder equity as well as result in increased costs and a decline in the value of our assets or common shares 
we expect to maintain general liability  director and officer insurance  and some insurance against our assets but not with full replacement of value expectations 
we may decide to update or amend our insurance portfolio in the future if it is available at economically viable rates 
mineral operations are subject to market forces outside of our control which could negatively impact our business or operations 
the marketability of minerals is affected by numerous factors beyond our control including market fluctuations  government regulations relating to prices  taxes  royalties  allowable production  imports  exports and supply and demand 
one or more of these risk elements could have an impact on the costs of our operations and if significant enough  reduce the profitability or viability of operations 
permitting  licensing and approval processes are required for our operations and obtaining and maintaining these permits and licenses is subject to conditions which we may be unable to achieve 
many of the operations at the bear lodge property require licenses and permits from various governmental authorities 
we believe we hold  or are in the process of obtaining  all necessary licenses and permits to carry on the activities which we are currently conducting or propose to conduct under applicable laws and regulations 
such licenses and permits are subject to changes in regulations and changes in various operating circumstances 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain all necessary licenses and permits that may be required to maintain the current or planned exploration and mining activities including constructing mines or milling facilities and commencing operations at the bear lodge property 
in addition  if we proceed to production on the bear lodge property or any other properties that we may acquire in the future  we must obtain and comply with permits and licenses which may contain specific operating conditions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such permits and licenses or that we will be able to comply with any such conditions 
costs related to applying for and obtaining permits and licenses may be prohibitive and could delay planned exploration and development activities 
failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions  including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed  and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures  installation of additional equipment  or remedial actions 
parties engaged in mining operations may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations 
amendments to current laws  regulations and permits governing operations and activities of mining companies  or more stringent implementation thereof  could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cause increases in capital expenditures or production costs or reduction in levels of production at producing properties or require abandonment or delays in development of new mining properties 
we are subject to significant governmental regulations  which affect our operations and impact the cost of conducting our business 
our current and future operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations  including laws and regulations governing mineral concession acquisition  prospecting  development  mining and production  laws and regulations related to exports  taxes and fees  labor standards and regulations related to occupational health and mine safety  environmental standards and regulations related to waste disposal  toxic substances  land use and environmental protection  and other matters 
companies engaged in exploration activities often experience increased costs and delays in production and other schedules as a result of the need to comply with applicable laws  regulations and permits 
failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations and permits may result in enforcement actions  including the forfeiture of claims  orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities requiring operations to cease or be curtailed  and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures  installation of additional equipment or costly remedial actions 
we may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of our mineral exploration activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of such laws  regulations and permits 
existing and possible future laws  regulations and permitting requirements governing operations and activities of exploration companies  or more stringent implementation  could have a material adverse impact on our business and cause increases in capital expenditures or require abandonment or delays in exploration 
our operations are subject to environmental risks and compliance with environmental regulations which are increasing and costly 
all phases of our operations are subject to environmental regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement  increased fines and penalties for non compliance  more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers  directors and employees 
these laws address emissions into the air  discharges into water  management of waste  management of hazardous substances  protection of natural resources  antiquities and endangered species and reclamation of lands disturbed by mining operations 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations and future changes in these laws and regulations may require significant capital outlays and may cause material changes or delays in our current and planned operations and future activities 
it is possible that future changes in these laws or regulations could have a significant adverse impact on our bear lodge property or some portion of our business  causing us to re evaluate those activities at that time 
examples of current us federal laws which may affect our current operations and may impact future business and operations include  but are not limited to  the following the comprehensive environmental  response  compensation  and liability act cercla  and comparable state statutes  impose strict  joint and several liability on current and former owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites 
it is not uncommon for the government to file claims requiring cleanup actions  demands for reimbursement for government incurred cleanup costs  or natural resource damages  or for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment 
the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  and comparable state statutes  govern the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance  as well as requirements for corrective actions 
cercla  rcra and comparable state statutes can impose liability for clean up of sites and disposal of substances found on exploration  mining and processing sites long after activities on such sites have been completed 
the clean air act  as amended  restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources  including mining and processing activities 
our mining operations may produce air emissions  including fugitive dust and other air pollutants from stationary equipment  storage facilities and the use of mobile sources such as trucks and heavy construction equipment  which are subject to review  monitoring and or control requirements under the clean air act and state air quality laws 
new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin  and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance 
in addition  permitting rules may impose limitations on our production levels or result in additional capital expenditures in order to comply with the regulations 
the national environmental policy act nepa requires federal agencies to integrate environmental considerations into their decision making processes by evaluating the environmental impacts of their proposed actions  including issuance of permits to mining facilities  and assessing alternatives to those actions 
if a proposed action could significantly affect the environment  the agency must prepare a detailed statement known as an environmental impact statement eis 
the us environmental protection agency  other federal agencies  and any interested third parties will review and comment on the scoping of the eis and the adequacy of and findings set forth in the draft and final eis 
we are required to undertake the nepa process for the bear lodge property permitting 
the nepa process can cause delays in issuance of required permits or result in changes to a project to mitigate its potential environmental impacts  which can in turn impact the economic feasibility of a proposed project or the ability to construct or operate the bear lodge property or other properties entirely 
the clean water act cwa  and comparable state statutes  imposes restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the environmental protection agency epa or an analogous state agency 
the cwa regulates storm water mining facilities and requires a storm water discharge permit for certain activities 
such a permit requires the regulated facility to monitor and sample storm water run off from its operations 
the cwa and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the united states unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit 
the cwa and comparable state statutes provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release 
the safe drinking water act sdwa and the underground injection control uic program promulgated thereunder  regulate the drilling and operation of subsurface injection wells 
epa directly administers the uic program in some states and in others the responsibility for the program has been delegated to the state 
the program requires that a permit be obtained before drilling a disposal or injection well 
violation of these regulations and or contamination of groundwater by mining related activities may result in fines  penalties  and remediation costs  among other sanctions and liabilities under the swda and state laws 
in addition  third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies  property damages  and bodily injury 
regulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change 
legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us  our venture partners and suppliers  including costs related to increased energy requirements  capital equipment  environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations 
any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations 
given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be dealt with  we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition  operating performance and ability to compete 
furthermore  even without such regulation  increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation 
the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain  and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate 
these may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities  water shortages  changing sea levels and changing temperatures 
these impacts may adversely impact the cost  production and financial performance of our operations 
land reclamation requirements for our properties may be burdensome and expensive 
although variable depending on location and the governing authority  land reclamation requirements are generally imposed on mineral exploration companies as well as companies with mining operations in order to minimize long term effects of land disturbance 
reclamation may include requirements to control dispersion of potentially deleterious effluents  treat ground and surface water to drinking water standards  and reasonably re establish pre disturbance land forms and vegetation 
in order to carry out reclamation obligations imposed on us in connection with the potential development activities at the bear lodge property  we must allocate financial resources that might otherwise be spent on further exploration and development programs 
we have set up a provision for reclamation obligations as currently anticipated for the bear lodge property  as appropriate  but this provision may not be adequate 
if we are required to carry out unanticipated reclamation work  our financial position could be adversely affected 
legislation has been proposed that would significantly affect the mining industry and our business 
members of the us congress have repeatedly introduced bills which would supplant or alter the provisions of the mining law of if enacted  such legislation could change the cost of holding unpatented mining claims and could significantly impact our ability to develop mineralized material on unpatented mining claims 
such bills have proposed  among other things  to either eliminate or greatly limit the right to a mineral patent and to impose a federal royalty on production from unpatented mining claims 
although we cannot predict what legislated royalties might be  the enactment of these proposed bills could adversely affect the potential for development of unpatented mining claims and the economics of existing operating mines on federal unpatented mining claims 
passage of such legislation could adversely affect our ability to operate or our financial performance 
increased competition could adversely affect our ability to attract necessary capital funding or acquire suitable producing properties or prospects for mineral exploration in the future 
the mining industry is intensely competitive 
significant competition exists for the acquisition of properties producing or capable of producing ree  gold or other metals 
we may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring additional mining properties because we must compete with other individuals and companies  many of which have greater financial resources  operational experience and technical capabilities than we have 
we may also encounter increasing competition from other mining companies in our efforts to hire experienced mining professionals 
competition for exploration resources at all levels is currently very intense  particularly affecting the availability of manpower  drill rigs  mining equipment and production equipment 
increased competition could adversely affect our ability to attract necessary capital funding  acquire suitable producing properties or prospects for mineral exploration in the future  or attract or retain key personnel or outside technical resources 
foreign currency fluctuations may have a negative impact on our financial position and results 
our property interests in the united states make it subject to foreign currency fluctuations that may adversely affect our financial position and results 
we maintain accounts in canadian dollars  and thus  any appreciation in the us dollar against the canadian dollar increases the costs of carrying out our operations in the united states 
management may or may not enter into any foreign currency contracts from time to time to mitigate this risk 
by failing to enter into currency contracts  or the risk in the currency contracts themselves  may cause losses due to adverse foreign currency fluctuations 
we are dependent on key personnel and the absence of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business 
our success is currently largely dependent on the performance  retention and abilities of our directors  officers  employees and management 
the loss of the services of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
there is no assurance that we can maintain the services of our directors  officers  employees or other qualified personnel required to operate our business 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us and our prospects 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 
we may experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified management to meet the needs of our anticipated growth  and the failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
competition for additional qualified management is intense  and we may be unable to attract and retain additional key personnel  or to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms 
management personnel are currently limited and they may be unable to manage our expansion successfully and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have not entered into non competition agreements 
as the business is substantially dependent upon the directors  executive officers and consultants  the lack of non competition agreements poses a significant risk in the event such persons were to resign or be terminated from such positions 
under such circumstances  such persons may provide confidential information and key contacts to competitors and we may have difficulties in preventing the disclosure of such information 
such disclosure would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
our directors senior management are engaged in other businesses 
potential conflicts of interest and other obligations of management could interfere with corporate operations 
some of our directors and officers are engaged and will continue to be engaged in additional businesses  and situations may arise where these directors and officers could be in direct competition with us 
conflicts  if any  will be dealt with in accordance with the relevant provisions of applicable policies  regulations and legislation 
some of our directors and officers are or may become directors or officers of other entities engaged in other business ventures 
in order to avoid the possible conflict of interest which may arise between the directors and officers duties to us and their duties to the other entities they are involved  our directors and officers have been advised as follows by us participation in other business ventures offered to the directors or officers should be allocated between the various entities and on the basis of prudent business judgment and the relative financial abilities and needs of such entities to participate  no commissions or other extraordinary consideration will be paid to such directors and officers  and business opportunities formulated by or through other entities in which the directors and officers are involved should not be offered to us except on the same or better terms than the basis on which they are offered to third party participants 
as a result of their other business endeavors  our directors and officers may not be able to devote sufficient time to our business affairs  which may negatively affect our ability to conduct ongoing operations and to generate revenues 
in addition  our management may periodically be interrupted or delayed as a result of our officers other business interests 
us investors may not be able to enforce their civil liabilities against us or our directors  controlling persons and officers 
it may be difficult to bring and enforce suits against us 
we are incorporated in the province of british columbia  canada under the british columbia business corporations act 
some of our directors are residents of canada  and a substantial portion of their assets are located outside of the united states 
as a result  it may be difficult for us holders of our common shares to affect service of process on these persons within the united states or to realize in the united states upon judgments rendered against them 
in addition  a shareholder should not assume that the courts of canada i would enforce judgments of us courts obtained in actions against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws or other laws of the united states  or ii would enforce  in original actions  liabilities against us or such persons predicated upon the us federal securities laws or other laws of the united states 
we do not currently intend to pay cash dividends 
we have not declared any dividends since incorporation and do not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future 
our present policy is to retain all available funds for use in our development  operations and expansion of our business 
payment of future cash dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our financial condition  results of operations  contractual restrictions  capital requirements  business prospects and other factors that the board of directors considers relevant 
accordingly  investors will only see a return on their investment if the value of our common shares appreciates 
dilution through outstanding common share options could adversely affect our shareholders 
because our success is highly dependent upon our employees and consultants  we have granted to some or all of our key employees  directors and consultants options to purchase common shares as non cash incentives 
to the extent that significant numbers of such options may be granted and exercised  the interests of the other shareholders may be diluted 
as of june   there are  common share purchase options outstanding  which  if exercised  would result in an additional  common shares being issued and outstanding 
future sales of our securities in the public or private markets could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares and our ability to continue to raise funds in new stock offerings 
it is likely that we will sell common shares or securities exercisable or convertible into common shares in order to finance our planned exploration and development activities 
future sales of substantial amounts of our securities in the public or private markets would dilute our existing shareholders and potentially adversely affect the trading prices of our common shares  and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of securities 
alternatively  we may rely on debt financing and assume debt obligations that require us to make substantial interest and capital payments which could adversely affect our business and future growth potential 
price volatility of our publicly traded securities could adversely affect investor s portfolios 
in recent years  the securities markets in the united states and canada have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility  and the market prices of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations in price which have not necessarily been related to the operating performance  underlying asset values or prospects of such companies 
there can be no assurance that continual fluctuations in price will not occur 
it may be anticipated that any quoted market for the common shares will be subject to market trends and conditions generally  notwithstanding any potential success we have in creating revenues  cash flows or earnings 
the price of our common shares has been subject to price and volume volatility in the past and will likely continue to be subject to such volatility in the future 
we likely constituted a passive foreign investment company during the fiscal year ended june   which could have adverse us federal income tax consequences for us shareholders 
us investors in our common shares should be aware that we believe that we were classified as a pfic during the tax year ended june   and based on current business plans and financial expectations  we expect that we will be a pfic for the current fiscal year 
if we are a pfic for any year during a us shareholder s holding period  then such us shareholder generally will be required to treat any gain realized upon a disposition of common shares  or any so called excess distribution received on our common shares  as ordinary income  and to pay an interest charge on a portion of such gain or distributions  unless the shareholder makes a timely and effective qualified electing fund election qef election or a mark to market election with respect to the common shares 
a us shareholder who makes a qef election generally must report on a current basis its share of our net capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which we are a pfic  whether or not we distribute any amounts to our shareholders 
however  us shareholders should be aware that there can be no assurance that we will satisfy record keeping requirements that apply to a qualified electing fund  or that we will supply us shareholders with information that such us shareholders are required to report under the qef election rules  in the event that we are a pfic and a us shareholder wishes to make a qef election 
thus  us shareholders may not be able to make a qef election with respect to their common shares 
a us shareholder who makes the mark to market election generally must include as ordinary income each year the excess of the fair market value of the common shares over the taxpayer s basis therein 
each us shareholder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the us federal  us federal alternative minimum  us federal estate and gift  us state and local  and foreign tax consequences of the pfic rules and the acquisition  ownership  and disposition of common shares 
item b 
unresolved staff comments we do not have any unresolved comments from the sec staff regarding our periodic or current reports under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
item properties detailed information is contained herein with respect to our property 
units of measurement are reported in units used by the qualified person as defined by national instrument ni in compiling reports on the bear lodge property 
bear lodge property wyoming  usa the bear lodge property is comprised of two projects  the bear lodge ree project and the sundance gold project 
the bear lodge ree project consists of the bull hill mine deposit  the whitetail ridge resource area  and the east taylor and carbon exploration targets 
additional details on each of these areas are set forth below under the heading bear lodge ree project 
we hold our interest in the bear lodge property through our wholly owned subsidiary  rare element resources  inc rer  inc 
the bear lodge property is located in central crook county  northeastern wyoming and is approximately miles northwest of the town of sundance  wyoming 
the property is accessible by paved and well maintained gravel roads 
the property lies within the black hills national forest along the crest of the northern part of the bear lodge mountains  a narrow northwest trending range 
physiographically it is the northwest extension of the black hills in western south dakota 
the range is characterized by rolling grass and pine covered mountains that reach elevations of  meters within the property 
the mountains have moderate slopes covered by western yellow pine forest interspersed with dense thickets of brush 
narrow grassy meadows cover the upper reaches of seasonal drainages 
the lowest point within the property is about  meters in elevation 
the climate during the summer is warm and relatively dry  followed by cold winters with variable amounts of snow 
indirectly through rer  inc  we control of the mineral rights at the bear lodge property  consisting of both unpatented mining claims and a wyoming state mining lease 
we hold unpatented mining claims located on land administered by the us forest service and a hectare wyoming state mining lease for a total of approximately  hectares 
the property is located within parts of sections through  sections through and sections through in township north and range west  sixth principal meridian 
all of the mining claims are unpatented  such that the paramount ownership and title of the land are held by the united states of america 
claim maintenance payments and related documents must be filed annually with the wyoming state office of the bureau of land management blm and recorded with the crook county  wyoming clerk and recorder  to keep the claims from terminating by operation of law  and the claims can be maintained in good standing so long as those requirements are met 
all of our mineral resources are located on mining rights that we hold 
our interest in the unpatented mining claims was  in part  acquired from phelps dodge exploration company now freeport mcmoran corporation  freeport by way of a mineral lease and option for deed in and an additional claims were transferred from newmont mining corporation newmont to us in may  a portion of the newmont transferred claims had been held in a joint venture between newmont and the company since some of the newmont transferred claims approximately are subject to a perpetual production net smelter return nsr royalty on minerals  except for rare earth minerals  which are excluded from any royalty obligations 
the newmont transferred claims are further subject to a right of first refusal granted to newmont for any sale or disposition of the claims to third parties by the company 
this right of first refusal applies only to parties or partners for non rare earth extraction and terminates on may   we acquired additional unpatented mining claims in  which resulted in our interest in total unpatented mining claims 
some of our mining claims and a portion of a defined area of influence surrounding the claims were previously subject to a production royalty of of nsr payable to freeport  but the royalty was subsequently purchased by us in march in july rare element resources ltd 
assigned the freeport royalty to rare element resources  inc retaining the royalty as it applies to the production of rare earth minerals 
as a result of the agreements above  we hold an unencumbered rare earth project including all unpatented mining claims  free of royalties for rare earth production 
some of the claims are subject to a non rare earth newmont royalty of as described above 
the wyoming state lease section grants us the right to prospect  mine  extract  and remove gold  silver and precious metals  rare earth metals  base metals and other metals from the leased area  along with surface rights necessary to the full enjoyment of the mineral rights 
a nominal rental payment is required each year  which is currently us per acre 
a sliding scale royalty of to of an adjusted sales value per ton is due to the state of wyoming if a mine is developed on the leased land  unless a lower royalty is fixed by the board of land commissioners 
the lease is for a period of years  ending october   and can be renewed for additional ten year terms 
exploration has been carried out on bear lodge property since its discovery in in addition to freeport  several mining companies have conducted exploration and drilling programs at or near the property since the discovery of mineralization 
no mining or operations were conducted at the bear lodge property by any of the prior owners 
necessary infrastructure  such as housing  food and fuel is available in townships in close proximity to the property 
supplies can be trucked in on both us interstate highway and rail lines 
a burlington northern rail transport line also runs through moorcroft  miles west of sundance 
the gillette  wyoming area  located approximately miles to the west  has a coal fired power plant  and would be a major logistics center for any development at the bear lodge property 
the current size of the property is sufficiently large to support a mining operation  with no foreseeable obstacles regarding expansion  subject to a favorable environmental permitting outcome 
we are not aware of any outstanding environmental liabilities  except for reclamation work associated with our ongoing exploration and drilling activities 
we hold all the necessary permits to carry out current exploration and evaluation programs 
permits for the current operations were approved by both the us forest service and the wyoming department of environmental quality 
we have an approved reclamation plan and a posted reclamation bond to cover the reclamation and cost of exploration and environmental related work 
additional local  state and federal permits will be required for a mining and processing operations should we decide to proceed to mine development and operations

bear lodge ree project within the bear lodge property  we have identified a rare earth element resource project called the bear lodge ree project 
rare earth element ree mineralization occurs in the north central core of an alkaline igneous complex in the bear lodge property 
all of the most important ree deposits and occurrences within the bear lodge property are contained within our unpatented mining lode claims  and are located in the vicinity of the bull hill mine deposit 
rare earth mineralized bodies occur as dikes  veins and stockwork within the bull hill mine deposit area of the bear lodge ree project 
the mineralization includes a well defined  near surface oxidized fmr iron oxide manganese oxide ree zone  a near surface oxidized but incompletely leached carbonatite zone oxide carbonate zone  a transitional or mixed zone oxide sulfide  and a deeper sulfide bearing carbonatite a high carbonate igneous rock zone 
the oxide carbonate and transitional zones were referred to collectively in previous new releases and technical reports as transitional zone 
as our understanding of the deposit has progressed  it made sense to sub classify mineralized zones based on key characteristics of those zones 
the fmr dikes and veins contain no matrix carbonates or sulfides 
the sulfides are completely oxidized to hydrous iron oxides  and the non ree bearing carbonate minerals calcite and strontianite are completely leached from the zone  which ranges from the surface to depths of about feet 
the oxide carbonate zone generally occurs beneath the oxide zone  but may locally breach the surface in select dikes 
it is characterized by an absence of sulfides  with the residual iron oxides formed during the complete oxidation of the former sulfide minerals  and by variable amounts of relicit matrix carbonates calcite strontianite 
bull hill mine deposit the bull hill mine deposit contains the mineral resources and mineral reserves as reported in our prefeasibility study pfs dated april   as further discussed below 
the bull hill mine deposit comprises a steeply dipping fmr carbonatite dike swarm 
geological interpretation of results from the and drill programs indicate that the bull hill mine deposit resource area is dominated by northwest striking mineralized bodies in the southern two thirds of the resource area  while the northern part of the resource area exhibits a transitional change in strike from dominantly northwesterly to almost due north 
the dike swarm primarily intrudes heterolithic intrusive breccia of the bull hill diatreme 
carbonatite dikes at depth are interpreted to transition toward the surface into either oxide carbonate or fmr bodies  which range in size from veinlets to large dikes more than meters in width 
the bull hill mine deposit consists of one dominant dike set and several subsidiary dike sets in a swarm that has dimensions of more than meters along strike and less than meters in width 
the dikes appear to pinch and swell in both strike and dip directions  and they can be traced in drill holes more than meters down dip

oxides oxide stockwork total reserve classification tonnes in millions average grade treo tonnes in millions average grade treo tonnes in millions average grade treo proven probable proven probable the mineral reserve estimate was prepared using a cut off grade of reconciliation to sec industry guide since we report our mineral reserves to both ni and sec industry guide standards  it is possible for our mineral reserve figures to vary between the two standards 
where such a variance occurs it will arise from the differing requirements for reporting mineral reserves 
for example  ni has a minimum requirement that mineral reserves be supported by a pre feasibility study  whereas sec industry guide requires support from a detailed feasibility study that demonstrates that economic extraction is justified 
at june   under sec industry guide  we would have reported mineralized material of million tonnes at a cut off grade of and million tonnes at a cut off grade of  which include the mineral reserves reported above under ni and measured and indicated resources reported in the tables below  but excludes our inferred resource estimate

mr 
noble is an independent qualified person for the purposes of national instrument standards of disclosure for mineral projects of the canadian securities administrators and has verified the data disclosed here 
our field programs were carried out under the supervision of dr 
james g 
clark  the company s vice president of exploration 
dr 
clark was a senior geologist and  subsequently  exploration supervisor for hecla mining company during the late s and early s and was responsible for that company s exploration of bull hill and the bear lodge district  and its initial discovery of the bull hill sw resource area 
a detailed qa qc program was implemented for the through drill programs 
the qa qc program was organized by dr 
jeffrey jaacks 
dr 
jaacks and dr 
clark have verified the sampling procedures and qa qc data delivered to ore reserves engineering 
they share the opinion that the data are of good quality and suitable for use in the mineral resource estimate 
metallurgy the resource size is sensitive to an assumed cut off grade  which is also sensitive to metallurgical operating costs 
the metallurgical testing is ongoing on oxide samples 
nearly all of the minable material is sufficiently close to the surface for potential mining by open pit methods 
the current oxide and oxide carbonate proven and probable mineral reserves contain million tonnes of ore at a grade of reo and million tonnes of oxide stockwork ore at a grade of reo 
the oxide mineralization extends from surface to depths of approximately meters 
the current testing program conducted on this oxide mineralization is designed to take advantage of the unique type of mineral occurrence in the ree mineralization 
the mineralization is characterized by fine grained ree minerals that variably adhere to the surfaces of the coarser gangue non ree bearing minerals 
the ree minerals in oxide mineralization from the mineral resource area are largely from the bastnasite group bastnasite  synchysite  and parasite with variable  but subordinate  proportions of monazite and cerianite 
metallurgical testwork is being conducted at mountain states r d international  inc msrdi of vail  arizona 
confirmatory testing was conducted by nagrom of perth  australia with preliminary re purification and separation testwork being conducted by ansto australian nuclear science and technology organization of sydney  australia 
bulk sampling of oxide mineralization from large diameter drill core and from surface trenches took place in the fall of the bulk sample was processed in a pilot plant test to support the pfs that was completed in rare earth mineralized bodies occur as high grade dikes and veins within the bull hill deposit 
they include a well defined  near surface oxidized zone that has been the subject of most metallurgical testing to date 
the oxide mineralization contains essentially no matrix carbonates or sulfides 
the sulfides are completely oxidized to hydrous iron oxides  and the non ree bearing carbonate minerals calcite and strontianite are completely leached from the zone  which ranges from the surface to depths of about meters 
these conditions created a loose and friable oxide material that allows for a simple physical mineral processing method 
in parts of the high grade zone  the sulfides are oxidized but matrix carbonate is partially and variably leached 
this zone is termed the oxide carbonate zone 
a thin transitional zone occurs at the base of the oxide and or oxide carbonate zone at a depth of approximately meters 
the transitional zone passes relatively abruptly into the sulfide bearing zone with typical carbonatite characteristics 
tests on the high grade oxide mineralization indicate that a recovery of of reo is expected using a two stage process 
the first stage is mineral concentration  also known as physical upgrading pug 
the second stage is a chemical leaching process using hydrochloric acid that produces a mixed rare earths leachate that is precipitated as a bulk carbonate concentrate 
the series of bench scale testing programs was completed by msrdi under the direction of dr 
roshan bhappu and a pilot plant test program was completed by hazen research 
a parallel series of tests to verify the process was conducted by nagrom of perth  australia  under the direction of mr 
tony wilkinson  general manager 
additional testwork is currently in progress at sgs lakefield to evaluate the variability in metallurgical performance based on the spatial and minor mineralogical differences throughout the deposit

other exploration targets at the bear lodge ree project discoveries of high grade ree mineralization at the whitetail ridge resource area and the east taylor and carbon target areas expand the area of known ree mineralization outside of the bull hill deposits and identify a district underlain by significant and potentially economic ree mineralization 
the data indicates that the bear lodge ree area covers a crudely elliptical area that extends approximately  meters northwest southeast by  meters northeast southwest 
the whitetail ridge resource area and carbon target are located northwest of the bull hill deposits  and the east taylor target is located west of the bull hill deposits 
based on a re evaluation of assay data for the whitetail ridge and carbon areas during our most recent resource estimation  and ree assay data from the drilling program at the whitetail ridge resource area and east taylor and carbon target areas  assay grades for individual ree between deposits and target areas at the bear lodge project indicate a zonation of what are referred to as light rare earth elements lree and hrees in the district 
the mineralization at whitetail ridge resource area and at the east taylor and carbon exploration target areas has a distribution characterized by elevated abundances of hree relative to the mineralization at the bull hill mine deposit 
the three western mineralized zones are characterized by high grades for total reo  as well as some of the highest grades of hree in north american deposits 
they are particularly enriched in europium  terbium  dysprosium  and yttrium eu  tb  dy  and y 
the hree enrichment was identified during the re examination of reverse circulation drill chips in several of the company s gold exploration holes 
the mineralized intervals in gold exploration drill holes sun  sun  and sun were submitted for quantitative ree analyses in  and additional intercepts from selected gold exploration drill holes at the carbon and taylor exploration target areas were submitted earlier in the assay results demonstrate significant hree enrichment at whitetail ridge resource area and at the carbon and taylor exploration targets 
lree generally include ce  la  nd  pr  and sm  hree include eu  gd  tb  dy  ho  er  tm  yb  lu  and y 
these new discoveries indicate good potential for new deposits of high grade ree in the western half of the bear lodge ree project  and those deposits appear particularly enriched in the hree

four core drilling rigs and one rotary reverse circulation drill rig are currently onsite and will be used to test ree mineralization at the bull hill mine deposit and whitetail ridge resource areas  and at the carbon and east taylor ree target areas 
the program to test the ree mineralization is planned to consist of approximately angle drill holes to general depths of meters to meters 
we expect to augment the ree drilling program by geological mapping  geophysical surveys  soil and rock chip geochemical surveys  and additional bulk sampling of near surface mineralized material 
sundance gold project the sundance gold project is the second project located on our bear lodge property

our common shares are not taxable canadian property provided that they are listed on a designated stock exchange which includes the tsx  and that neither you nor one or more persons with whom you did not deal at arm s length  alone or together  at any time in the five years immediately preceding the disposition  owned or more of the issued shares of any class or series of our capital stock 
even if our common shares are taxable canadian property to you  under the treaty you will generally be exempt from paying canadian income tax on any gain provided that you are a resident of the united states for the purposes of the treaty and are otherwise eligible for the benefits of the treaty  and further provided that the value of our common shares is not derived principally from real property situated in canada 
currently  our common shares do not derive their value principally from real property situated in canada and therefore capital gains realized from the disposition of our common shares would be exempt from tax by virtue of the provisions of the tax treaty  however  the determination as to whether canadian tax would be applicable on a sale  disposition or deemed disposition of common shares must be made at the time of that sale  disposition or deemed disposition 
certain us federal income tax considerations the following discussion is a general summary of the material us federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our common shares by a holder of our common shares that is an individual resident of the united states or a united states corporation a us holder 
this summary is general in nature and does not address the effects of any state or local taxes  us federal estate  gift  or generation skipping taxes  or the tax consequences in jurisdictions other than the united states 
in addition  this discussion does not discuss all aspects of us federal income taxation that may be relevant to investors subject to special treatment under us federal income tax law including  for example  owners of or more of the voting shares of the company 
this summary is based on the us internal revenue code of  as amended which we refer to as the code  the regulations promulgated thereunder  court decisions and published rulings of the internal revenue service the irs  as in effect on the date hereof  and the convention between the united states of america and canada with respect to taxes on income and on capital signed on september   as amended and currently in force which we refer to as the treaty  and does not take into account the possible effect of future legislative or administrative changes or court decisions 
we will not request any rulings from the irs or obtain any opinions from counsel on the tax consequences described below  or on any other issues 
the irs or a court might reach a contrary conclusion with respect to the issues addressed herein if the matter were to be contested 
future legislative or administrative changes or court decisions may significantly change the conclusions expressed herein  and any such changes or decisions may have a retroactive effect with respect to the matters discussed herein 
you should consult your own advisor regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the acquisition  ownership and disposition of our common shares in light of your particular circumstances 
sale or other disposition of our common shares subject to the passive foreign investment company rules discussed below  a us holder that sells or otherwise disposes of our common shares will recognize capital gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between i the us dollar value of the amount realized on the sale or disposition and ii the tax basis  determined in us dollars  of those common shares 
if the us holder is an individual  any capital gain generally will be subject to us federal income tax at preferential rates if specified minimum holding periods are met 
long term capital gains of non corporate taxpayers  including individuals  are generally subject to a maximum us federal income tax rate for capital gains recognized in taxable years beginning before january  under current law  long term capital gains of non corporate taxpayers  including individuals  recognized in taxable years beginning after december   will be taxed at a maximum us federal income tax rate of 
the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations 
distributions we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
however  subject to the passive foreign investment company rules discussed below  a us holder must include in gross income as dividend income the gross amount of any distribution including the amount of any canadian withholding tax thereon paid by the company out of its current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes with respect to our common shares 
except as described below  dividends received by a non corporate us holder before january   would be taxed at preferential rates as qualified dividend income to such us holder and will generally be subject to a maximum us federal income tax rate 
under current law  dividends received in taxable years beginning after december   will generally be taxed at the same rate as ordinary income 
a distribution on our common shares in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a tax free return of capital to the extent of the us holder s adjusted basis in such common shares thus reducing  but not below zero  the adjusted tax basis of such common shares  and thereafter as gain from the sale or exchange of common shares 
see sale or other disposition of our common shares above 
however  dividend income will not be qualified dividend income and will be taxed at ordinary income rates if i the us holder fails to hold the common shares for at least days during the day period beginning days before the ex dividend date  ii the irs determines that the treaty is not a comprehensive income tax treaty that entitles our dividends to qualified dividend treatment and our common shares are no longer readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states  or iii we are a passive foreign investment company for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or in the preceding taxable year 
for foreign tax credit limitation purposes  dividends paid by us will be income from sources outside the united states 
subject to various limitations  canadian withholding taxes will be treated as foreign taxes eligible for credit against a us holder s us federal income tax liability 
the limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income 
dividend income generally will constitute passive category income  or in the case of certain us holders  general category income 
the use of foreign tax credits is subject to complex conditions and limitations 
in lieu of a credit  a us holder who itemizes deductions may elect to deduct all of such holder s foreign taxes in the taxable year 
a deduction does not reduce us tax on a dollar for dollar basis like a tax credit  but the deduction for foreign taxes is not subject to the same limitations applicable to foreign tax credits 
us holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits 
passive foreign investment company rules a non us corporation will be classified as a passive foreign investment company a pfic in any taxable year in which  after taking into account the income and assets of certain subsidiaries  either i at least of its gross income is passive income  or ii at least of the average value of its assets is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income 
whether or not we will be classified as a pfic in any taxable year is a factual determination and will depend upon our assets  the market value of our common shares  and our activities in each year and is therefore subject to change 
we believe that we were classified as a pfic during the taxable year ended june   and based on current business plans and financial projections  we believe there is a significant likelihood that it will be a pfic during the current taxable year 
the tests for determining pfic status depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control and can be subject to uncertainties 
accordingly  we cannot assure us holders that we are a pfic for the year ended june   or any future year 
we undertake no obligation to advise us holders of our common shares as to our pfic status for any year 
a us holder whose holding period for our common shares includes any portion in the years in which we are a pfic generally would be subject to a special adverse tax regime in respect of excess distributions 
excess distributions include certain distributions received with respect to pfic shares in a taxable year 
gain recognized by a us holder on a sale or other transfer of our common shares including certain transfers that would otherwise be tax free  such as gifts  exchanges in a corporate reorganization  or grants as security for a loan also would be treated as excess distributions 
such excess distributions and gains would be allocated ratably to the us holder s holding period 
for these purposes  the holding period of shares acquired either through an exercise of options or the conversion of convertible debentures includes the us holder s holding period in the option or convertible debenture 
the portion of any excess distribution including gains treated as excess distributions allocated to the current year and to prior years before we first became a pfic would be includible as ordinary income in the current year 
the portion of any excess distribution allocated to all other prior years would be taxed at the highest marginal rate applicable to ordinary income for each such year regardless of the us holder s actual marginal rate for that year and without reduction by any losses or loss carry forwards and would be subject to interest charges 
elections may be available to mitigate the adverse tax rules that apply to pfics the so called qualified electing fund and mark to market elections  but these elections may accelerate the recognition of taxable income and may result in the recognition of ordinary income 
the qualified electing fund and mark to market elections are not available to us holders with respect to options to acquire our common shares or convertible debentures 
further  if a us holder of options or convertible debentures were to make either a qualified electing fund or mark to market election with respect to common shares received on exercise of an option or convertible debenture  the us holder will be required to treat as an excess distribution subject to the adverse rules described above any appreciation inherent in the common shares when the election first becomes effective 
the mark to market election may be made only if  and so long as  our common shares are regularly traded on a qualified exchange or market 
we have not decided whether we would provide to us holders the annual information that would be necessary to make the qualified electing fund election 
dividends received from us will not be qualified dividend income if we are a pfic in the year of payment  or were a pfic in the year preceding the year of payment  and will be subject to taxation at ordinary income rates 
if we are a pfic in a taxable year and own shares in another pfic a lower tier pfic  a us holder also will be subject to the excess distribution regime with respect to its indirect ownership of the lower tier pfic 
the mark to market election would not be available for any indirect ownership of a lower tier pfic 
a qef election can be made for a lower tier pfic  but only if we provide the us holder with the financial information necessary to make such an election 
special adverse rules that impact certain estate planning goals could apply to our common shares if we are a pfic 
special rules apply with respect to the calculation of the amount of the foreign tax credit with respect to excess distributions by a pfic 
in general  these rules allocate creditable foreign taxes over the us holder s holding period for common shares and otherwise coordinate the foreign tax credit limitation rules with the pfic rules 
us holders who own common shares during any year in which we are a pfic must file irs form with their us federal income tax return for each year in which such holder owns our common shares  even if we subsequently would not be considered a pfic 
pursuant to code section f  as amended in  us holders may be required to provide additional information regarding ownership of an interest in a pfic 
as of the date hereof  the internal revenue service has not promulgated regulations under code section f regarding such additional reporting requirements 
recently enacted legislation the recently enacted patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca requires certain us holders to pay up to an additional tax on dividends and capital gains for taxable years beginning after december  the ppaca is the subject of a number of constitutional challenges  and at least one court has held that the ppaca is unconstitutional 
us holders should also consult their tax adviser regarding potential reporting obligations  if any  under the hiring incentives to restore employment act  which provides rules relating to ownership of foreign financial assets or ownership of securities issued by a foreign issuer 
information reporting and backup withholding dividend payments made with respect to shares of our common shares and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our common shares may be subject to information reporting requirements and to us backup withholding currently at a rate of 
in general  backup withholding will apply with respect to reportable payments made to a us holder unless i the us holder is a corporation or other exempt recipient  and if required  demonstrates such exemption  or ii the us holder furnishes the payer with a taxpayer identification number on irs form w in the manner required  certifies under penalty of perjury that such us holder is not currently subject to backup withholding and otherwise complies with the backup withholding requirements 
backup withholding is not an additional tax 
rather  the amount of any backup withholding imposed on a payment to a holder will be allowed as a refund or a credit against such holder s us federal income tax liability  provided that the required information is furnished to the internal revenue service
