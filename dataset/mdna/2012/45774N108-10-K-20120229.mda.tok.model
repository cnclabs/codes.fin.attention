overview our financial performance in was highlighted by net sales of million compared to million for  a million improvement mostly attributable to higher selling prices  operating income of million was million higher than the million recorded in the prior year 
operating income includes a full year million benefit resulting from a reduction in the provision for excess water duty charges in mexico following a settlement with rhodia on rhodia s liability for the charges and improved estimates on probable amounts to be paid to the mexican comision national del agua  or cna  and includes a net million charge million gross  less a million rhodia indemnity receivable for the cna provision  net interest expense decreased million due to the replacement in mid of million of notes averaging interest with a partially drawn million senior secured credit facility that averaged interest rates below in  net income was million or per share diluted  the acquisition on october  of privately held ki acquisition  inc  the parent of kelatron corporation  for approximately million 
kelatron is a leading producer of bioactive mineral nutrients sold into the nutritional and dietary supplements markets  based in ogden  utah 
a net decrease in cash of million was principally due to increased net working capital current assets excluding cash minus current liabilities excluding current portion of long term debt to million at december   capital expenditures of million compared to million in  with higher spending due to manufacturing investments consisting of debottlenecking us canada and mexico specialty salts facilities coatzacoalcos upgrade of purified phosphoric acid  or ppa to food grade capability and enhanced capability to process multiple grades of phosphate rock expanding geographically with investment in china completion of the company s enterprise resource planning erp system  page of

recent trends and outlook underlying demand conditions for specialty phosphates remain strong  as evidenced by the excellent results in our mexico specialty phosphates business in the fourth quarter us canada volume in the fourth quarter was below expectations as a result of the weakening environment for horticultural and industrial applications  however  these effects are not expected to continue into and  overall  management expects specialty phosphates volume growth to be in line with the long term expectation driven by product innovation and geographic growth 
throughout  the specialty phosphates business met or exceeded its pricing objectives with fourth quarter pricing up year over year for specialty phosphates and for total innophos 
this covered higher overall raw material costs that approximated million for the fourth quarter 
market raw material prices increased as expected during the fourth quarter  but began to moderate as fertilizer market demand slowed towards the end of the year and into early innophos raw material costs are expected overall to continue increasing through the first half of primarily from the impact of the portion of raw material costs fixed annually resetting to higher benchmark levels 
management also expects to increase the level of expenditure on evaluating the company s mexican phosphate rock concessions  leading to an additional million of expense in targeted volume growth and some further expected increase in selling prices on a year over year basis are expected to offset the cost increases noted above to generate operating income growth for specialty phosphates in line with long term expectations 
trends in fertilizer markets are currently difficult to predict accurately  creating limited visibility in the gtsp business and for market raw material price trends in general 
recent industry publications have reported lower short term spot pricing on weaker demand conditions 
as a result  gtsp margins are expected to be significantly lower in the first quarter than just recorded in the fourth quarter  with sales expected to be around million and margins expected in the low to mid single digits 
gtsp margins are typically advantaged when fertilizer prices move up and disadvantaged when fertilizer prices decline 
if fertilizer prices stabilize through the rest of  gtsp margins are expected to improve 
net debt total debt less cash increased million in the fourth quarter due to million of increased working capital 
the increase came from increases in the value of raw materials and finished goods  the timing of phosphate rock purchases and a decision to increase us finished goods inventory levels in support of improved service levels 
excluding the working capital increase  operating cash flow in the quarter was sufficient to fund the million kelatron acquisition 
management expects strong operating cash flow generation in with a moderate reduction in working capital levels expected and capital expenditures targeted at or below depreciation levels 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million in  just below the to million expected range and  as a result  the expectation is for higher expenditures of to million 
investment continues to be focused on debottlenecking us canada and mexico specialty ingredients facilities  expanding geographically including the investment in china  and enhancing mexico s capability to process multiple grades of rock  consistent with the company s supply chain diversification strategy 
rhodia settlement over mexican water fees innophos recently settled with rhodia all issues between the companies concerning indemnity claims for water fees by the mexican water commission cna  certain port concession fees  and all other matters in related litigation filed by innophos and pending between the companies in the new york courts since separately  innophos reached agreement with the cna and began paying agreed sums disposing of the cna claims for and for lesser amounts than previously accrued for these years
