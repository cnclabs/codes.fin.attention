approximately of our total sales are direct ship sales 
direct ship sales are typically custom built products  large orders or products that are too bulky to be easily handled and  as a result  are shipped directly to the customer from the supplier 
special orders are for products that are not ordinarily stocked in inventory and are ordered based on a customer s specific request 
special orders represent the remainder of total sales 
we have historically financed our working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  share repurchases and new branch openings through internally generated cash flow  debt issuances  borrowings under our credit facilities and funding through our receivables facility 
cash flow we generated million in operating cash flow during included in this amount was increased operating results offset by investments in working capital to fund our growth 
investing activities included payments of million for the acquisitions of reco and brews and million for capital expenditures 
refer to note of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the reco and brews acquisitions

there was also an increase in bank overdrafts of million 
financing availability as of december   we had million in total available borrowing capacity 
the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  which has a maturity date in august was million  of which million was the us sub facility borrowing limit and million was the canadian sub facility borrowing limit 
the available borrowing capacity under the receivables facility  which has a maturity date in august was million 
in addition  in august  we completed an exchange offer pursuant to which we issued million in aggregate principal amount of debentures in exchange for approximately million and million in aggregate principal amounts of our debentures and debentures  respectively 
on december   we completed the conversion and redemption of all our outstanding debentures 
our debentures cannot be redeemed or repurchased until september for further discussion related to the debentures  refer to note of our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis  and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions 
for further discussions refer to liquidity and capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to supplier programs  bad debts  inventories  insurance costs  goodwill  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the 
table of contents carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to reserve items may be required 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized for product sales when title  ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer  or for services when the service is rendered 
in the case of stock sales and special orders  a sale occurs at the time of shipment from our distribution point  as the terms of our sales are predominantly fob shipping point 
in cases where we process customer orders but ship directly from our suppliers  revenue is recognized once product is shipped and title has passed 
in all cases  revenue is recognized once the sales price to our customer is fixed or is determinable and we have reasonable assurance as to the collectability 
in certain customer arrangements  we provide services such as inventory management 
we may perform some or all of the following services for customers determine inventory stocking levels  establish inventory reorder points  launch purchase orders  receive material  put away material  and pick material for order fulfillment 
we recognize revenue for services rendered during the period based upon a previously negotiated fee arrangement 
we also sell inventory to these customers and recognize revenue at the time title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
selling  general and administrative expenses we include warehousing  purchasing  branch operations  information services  and marketing and selling expenses in this category  as well as other types of general and administrative costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we have a systematic procedure using estimates based on historical data and reasonable assumptions of collectibles made at the local branch level and on a consolidated corporate basis to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
excess and obsolete inventory we write down our inventory to its net realizable value based on internal factors derived from historical analysis of actual losses 
looking back  we identify items at risk of becoming obsolete  defined as being in excess of months supply relative to demand or movement 
we then analyze in a detailed manner the ultimate disposition of the previously identified excess inventory items  such as sold  returned to supplier  or scrapped 
this item by item analysis allows us to develop an estimate which represents the historical likelihood that an item identified as being in excess supply ultimately becomes obsolete 
on a current basis  we apply the estimate to inventory items currently in excess of months supply  and reduce our inventory carrying value by the derived amount 
we revisit and test our assumptions on a periodic basis 
historically  we have not had material changes to our assumptions and do not anticipate any material changes in the future 
supplier volume rebates we receive rebates from certain suppliers based on contractual arrangements with them 
since there is a lag between actual purchases and the rebates received from the suppliers  we must estimate and accrue the approximate amount of rebates available at a specific date 
we record the amounts as other accounts receivable on the balance sheet 
the corresponding rebate income is recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
the appropriate level of such income is derived from the level of actual purchases made by us from suppliers 
supplier volume rebate rates have historically ranged between approximately and of sales depending on market conditions 
in  the rebate rate was 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets we test goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter using information available at the end of september  or more frequently when events or circumstances occur indicating that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we test for goodwill impairment on a reporting unit level 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets to the recorded value 
we estimate the fair value of goodwill using a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and market multiples 
assumptions used for these fair value techniques are based on a combination of historical results  current forecasts  market data and recent economic events 
we evaluate the recoverability of indefinite life intangible assets using a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected financial information 
the determination of fair value involves significant management judgment and we apply our best judgment when assessing the reasonableness of financial projections 
two primary assumptions were a discount rate of and a terminal growth rate of 
a possible indicator of goodwill impairment is the relationship of a company s market capitalization to its book value 
as of 
table of contents december   our market capitalization exceeded our book value and there were no reporting units sensitive to impairment 
the reported value of trademarks totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
two trademarks totaling million are most sensitive to a decline in financial performance 
we are taking actions to improve our financial performance related to these businesses  however  we cannot predict whether or not there will be certain events that could adversely affect their reported value 
intangible assets we account for certain economic benefits purchased as a result of our acquisitions  including customer relations  distribution agreements  technology and trademarks  as intangible assets 
except for trademarks  which have an indefinite life  we amortize intangible assets over a useful life determined by the expected cash flows produced by such intangibles and their respective tax benefits 
useful lives vary between and years  depending on the specific intangible asset 
insurance programs we use commercial insurance for auto  workers compensation  casualty and health claims as a risk sharing strategy to reduce our exposure to catastrophic losses 
our strategy involves large deductibles where we must pay all costs up to the deductible amount 
we estimate our reserve based on historical incident rates and costs 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record our deferred tax assets at amounts that are expected to be realized 
we evaluate future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance 
should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute prescribed by income tax accounting guidance 
we frequently review tax issues and positions taken on tax returns to determine the need and amount of contingency reserves necessary to cover any probable audit adjustments 
convertible debentures we separately account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debentures in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
we estimate our non convertible debt borrowing rate through a combination of discussions with our financial institutions and review of relevant market data 
the discounts to the convertible note balances are amortized to interest expense  using the effective interest method  over the implicit life of the debentures 
stock based compensation our stock based employee compensation plans are comprised of stock options  stock settled stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units 
compensation cost for all stock based awards is measured at fair value on the date of grant  and compensation cost is recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of stock options and stock settled appreciation rights is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock 
we estimate the expected life of stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant 
the forfeiture assumption is based on our historical employee behavior  which we review on an annual basis 
restricted stock units with vesting dependent upon service conditions are valued based on the market price on the grant date 
no dividends are assumed for stock based awards
