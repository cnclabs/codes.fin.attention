item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
references in this annual report on form k to we  our  us and the company refer to diamondrock hospitality company  including as the context requires  diamondrock hospitality limited partnership  as well as our other direct and indirect subsidiaries 
part i item business overview diamondrock hospitality company is a lodging focused maryland corporation operating as a real estate investment trust reit 
we own a portfolio of premium hotels and resorts that contain  guest rooms 
we also hold the senior note on a mortgage loan secured by an additional hotel and have the right to acquire  upon completion  a hotel under development 
as an owner  rather than an operator  of lodging properties  we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by the hotels after the payment of fees due to hotel managers  which are calculated based on the revenues and profitability of each hotel 
our vision is to be the premier allocator of capital in the lodging industry 
our mission is to deliver long term stockholder returns through a combination of dividends and enduring capital appreciation 
our strategy is to utilize disciplined capital allocation and focus on the acquisition  ownership and asset management of high quality  branded lodging properties with superior growth prospects in north american markets with high barriers to entry 
we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by adhering to three basic principles in executing our strategy high quality urban and destination resort focused branded hotel real estate  innovative asset management  and conservative capital structure 
in addition  we are committed to enhancing the value of the company s platform by being open and transparent in our communications with stockholders  scrutinizing our corporate overhead and adopting and following sound corporate governance practices 
consistent with our strategy  we continue to direct our energies toward opportunistic investments in premium full service hotels and premium urban limited service hotels located throughout north america 
our portfolio is concentrated in key gateway cities and destination resorts located in popular vacation settings 
each of our hotels is managed by a third party and most are operated under a brand owned by one of the leading global lodging brand companies marriott international  inc marriott  starwood hotels resorts worldwide  inc starwood or hilton worldwide hilton 
high quality urban and destination resort focused branded hotel real estate we own premium hotels and resorts throughout north america 
our hotels and resorts are primarily categorized as upper upscale as defined by smith travel research and are generally located in high barrier to entry markets with multiple demand generators 

table of contents our properties are concentrated in four key gateway cities new york city  chicago  los angeles and boston and in destination resort locations such as the us virgin islands and vail  colorado 
we consider lodging properties located in gateway cities and resort destinations to be the most capable of creating dynamic cash flow growth and achieving superior long term capital appreciation 
we also believe that these locations are better insulated from new supply due to relatively high barriers to entry  including expensive construction costs and limited development sites 
we critically evaluate each potential acquisition to insure that the prospective asset is aligned with the vision we have set forth  supports our mission and corresponds with our strategy 
furthermore  we regularly analyze our portfolio to identify weaknesses therein and to strategize for the disposition of non core assets in order to recycle capital for additional acquisitions 
a core tenet of our strategy is to leverage the top global hotel brands 
we strongly believe that the largest global hotel brands create significant value as a result of each brand s ability to produce incremental revenue and that  as a result  branded hotels are able to generate greater profits than similar unbranded hotels 
the dominant global hotel brands typically have very strong reservation and reward systems and sales organizations  and most of our hotels are operated under a brand owned by one of the top global lodging brand companies marriott  starwood or hilton 
generally  we are interested in owning hotels that are currently operated under  or can be converted to  a globally recognized brand 
however  we would own or acquire non branded hotels in certain top tier or unique markets if we believe that the returns on these hotels would be higher than if the hotels were operated under a globally recognized brand 
innovative asset management we believe that we create significant value in our portfolio by utilizing our management team s extensive experience and encouraging innovative asset management strategies 
our senior management team has established a broad network of hotel industry contacts and relationships  including relationships with hotel owners  financiers  operators  project managers and contractors and other key industry participants 
we use our broad network of hotel industry contacts and relationships to maximize the value of our hotels 
under the federal income tax rules governing reits  we are required to engage a hotel manager that is an eligible independent contractor to manage each of our hotels pursuant to a management agreement with one of our subsidiaries 
our philosophy is to negotiate management agreements that give us the right to exert significant influence over the management of our properties  annual budgets and all capital expenditures all  to the extent permitted under the reit rules  and then to use those rights to continually monitor and improve the performance of our properties 
we cooperatively partner with our hotel managers in an attempt to increase operating results and long term asset values at our hotels 
in addition to working directly with the personnel at our hotels  our senior management team also has long standing professional relationships with our hotel managers senior executives  and we work directly with these senior executives to improve the performance of our portfolio 
we continue to explore strategic options to maximize the growth of revenue and profitability 
we persist in impressing upon our hotel managers the importance of limiting increases in property level operating expenses 
we maintain our practice of working closely with managers to optimize business at our hotels in order to maximize revenue and we remain committed to the objective of maintaining conservative corporate expenses 
we believe we can create significant value in our portfolio through innovative asset management strategies such as rebranding  renovating and repositioning and we engage in a process of regular evaluations of our portfolio in order to determine if there are opportunities to employ these value add strategies 
conservative capital structure since our formation in  we have been committed to a conservative capital structure with prudent leverage 
our outstanding debt as of december  consists of fixed interest rate mortgage debt with no significant maturities until late and outstanding borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility  which bears interest at an attractive floating rate 
we also maintain low financial leverage by often funding a portion of our acquisitions with proceeds from the issuance of equity 
we prefer that a significant portion of our portfolio remain unencumbered by debt in order to provide maximum balance sheet flexibility 
in addition  to the extent that we incur additional debt  our preference is limited recourse secured mortgage debt 
we expect that our strategy will enable us to maintain a balance sheet with an appropriate amount of debt throughout all phases of the lodging cycle 
we believe that it is not prudent to increase the inherent risk of highly cyclical lodging fundamentals through use of a highly leveraged capital structure 
we prefer a relatively simple but efficient capital structure 
we have not invested in joint ventures and have not issued any 
table of contents operating partnership units or preferred stock 
we endeavor to structure our hotel acquisitions so that they will not overly complicate our capital structure  however  we will consider a more complex transaction if we believe that the projected returns to our stockholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available 
at all times  we actively review and manage the sources and uses of our funds in order to mitigate our exposure to economic risks and to maximize returns for our investors 
in response to volatility in the financial markets during the last several years  we have undertaken additional measures in order to navigate the challenges created thereby and we are perpetually evaluating and updating these measures in order to effectively address evolving economic  social and political climates 
our ultimate goal in this regard is to create and maintain long term stockholder value 
we believe that we maintain a reasonable amount of debt 
as of december   we had billion of total debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of percent and a weighted average maturity date of approximately years 
in addition  we had hotels unencumbered by debt and million outstanding on our million senior unsecured credit facility 
our company we commenced operations in july and became a public reporting company in may we have been successful in acquiring  financing and asset managing our hotels  completing over million of capital expenditures on time and on budget and complying with the complex public company accounting and legal requirements with only employees 
since our formation  we have sought to be forthright and transparent in our communications with investors  to actively monitor our corporate overhead and to adopt sound corporate governance practices 
we believe that we have among the most transparent disclosures in the industry and we consistently go beyond the minimum legal requirements and industry practice  for example  we provide quarterly operating performance data on each of our hotels  enabling our investors to effectively evaluate our successes and challenges 
finally  we consider our corporate governance practices to be sound in that we have a majority independent board of directors elected annually by our stockholders  we believe that our risk of takeover is limited by anti takeover devices and our officers and directors are subject to stock ownership policies designed to insure that these persons own a meaningful amount of stock in the company 
we currently own hotels that contain  hotel rooms  located in the following markets atlanta  georgia  austin  texas  boston  massachusetts  charleston  south carolina  chicago  illinois  denver  colorado  fort worth  texas  lexington  kentucky  los angeles  california  minneapolis  minnesota  new york  new york  oak brook  illinois  orlando  florida  salt lake city  utah  washington  dc  sonoma  california  st 
thomas  dc virgin islands  and vail  colorado 
we also own a senior mortgage loan secured by a room hotel located in chicago  illinois and have the right to acquire  upon completion  a room hotel under development in new york city 
during  we entered into an agreement to sell a portfolio of three hotels located in lexington  kentucky  austin  texas  and atlanta  georgia and the sale is expected to close during the first quarter of our corporate structure we conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership reit  or upreit  in which our hotels are owned by subsidiaries of our operating partnership  diamondrock hospitality limited partnership 
we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and currently own  either directly or indirectly  all of the limited partnership units of our operating partnership 
we have the ability to issue limited partnership units to third parties in connection with acquisitions of hotel properties 
in order for the income from our hotel investments to constitute rents from real property for purposes of the gross income tests required for reit qualification  we must lease each of our hotels to a wholly owned subsidiary of our taxable reit subsidiary  or trs each  a trs lessee  or to an unrelated third party 
we currently lease all of our domestic hotels to trs lessees 
in turn our trs lessees must engage a third party management company to manage the hotels 
however  we may structure our properties that are not subject to us federal income tax differently from the structures we use for our us properties 
for example  frenchman s reef is held by a us virgin islands corporation  which we have elected to be a trs 
the following chart shows our corporate structure as of the date of this report

environmental matters in connection with the ownership of hotels  the company is subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to environmental protection 
under these laws  a current or previous owner or operator including tenants of real estate may be liable for the costs or removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at  on  under or in such property 
these laws typically impose liability without regard to fault or whether or not the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contamination and the liability under these laws may be joint and several 
because these laws also impose liability on the persons who owned the property at the time it became contaminated  it is possible we could incur cleanup costs or other environmental liabilities even after we sell properties 
the presence of contamination  or the failure to properly remediate contamination  on a property may adversely affect the ability of the owner or operator to sell that property or to borrow funds using such property as collateral 
under the environmental laws  courts and government agencies also have the authority to require that a person who sent waste to a waste disposal facility  such as a landfill or incinerator  pay for the cleanup of that facility if it becomes contaminated and threatens human health or the environment 
our hotels are subject to various federal  state  and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations that address a wide variety of issues  including  but not limited to  storage tanks  air emissions from emergency generators  storm water and wastewater discharges  asbestos  lead based paint  mold and mildew and waste management 
our hotels incur costs to comply with these laws and regulations and could be subject to fines and penalties for non compliance 
furthermore  various court decisions have established that third parties may recover damages for injury caused by property contamination 
for instance  a person exposed to asbestos while staying in a hotel may seek to recover damages if he or she suffers injury from the asbestos 
lastly  some of these environmental laws restrict the use of a property or place conditions on various activities 
an example would be laws that require a business using chemicals such as swimming pool chemicals at a hotel property to manage them carefully and to notify local officials that the chemicals are being used 
prior to closing any property acquisition  we obtain phase i environmental assessments in order to attempt to identify potential environmental concerns at the properties 
these assessments are carried out in accordance with an appropriate level of due diligence and generally include a physical site inspection  a review of relevant federal  state and local environmental and health agency database records  one or more interviews with appropriate site related personnel  review of the property s chain of title and review of historic aerial photographs and other information regarding past uses of the property 
these assessments generally do not include soil sampling  subservice investigations  comprehensive asbestos surveys or mold investigations 
we cannot assure you that these assessments will discover every environmental condition that may be present on a property 
material environmental condition  
table of contents liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future  and future laws  ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability 
we believe that our hotels are in compliance  in all material respects  with all federal  state and local environmental ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters  the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we have not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our present properties 
competition the hotel industry is highly competitive and our hotels are subject to competition from other hotels for guests 
competition is based on a number of factors  including convenience of location  brand affiliation  price  range of services  guest amenities  and quality of customer service 
competition is specific to the individual markets in which our properties are located and will include competition from existing and new hotels operated under brands in the full service  select service and extended stay segments 
we believe that properties flagged with a marriott  starwood or hilton brand will enjoy the competitive advantages associated with their operations under such brand 
these global brands reservation systems and national advertising  marketing and promotional services combined with the strong management expertise they provide enable our properties to perform favorably in terms of both occupancy and room rates relative to other brands and non branded hotels 
the guest loyalty programs operated by these global brands generate repeat guest business that might otherwise go to competing hotels 
increased competition may have a material adverse effect on occupancy  average daily rate or adr and revenue per available room or revpar  or may require us to make capital improvements that we otherwise would not undertake  which may result in decreases in the profitability of our hotels 
we face competition for the acquisition of hotels from institutional pension funds  private equity funds  reits  hotel companies and others who are engaged in hotel acquisitions and investments 
some of these competitors have substantially greater financial and operational resources than we have and may have greater knowledge of the markets in which we seek to invest 
this competition may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us and increase the cost of acquiring our targeted hotel investments 
employees we currently employ full time employees 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
none of our employees is a member of any union  however  the employees of our hotel managers at the radisson lexington hotel  courtyard manhattan fifth avenue  frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort  westin boston waterfront hotel and hilton minneapolis are currently represented by labor unions and are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
regulation our properties must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of  as amended  or ada  to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined by the ada 
the ada may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable 
we believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ada and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ada 
however  noncompliance with the ada could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one  and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this regard 
insurance we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage  earthquake  business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket policy 
in addition  we carry earthquake and terrorism insurance on our properties in an amount and with deductibles which we believe are commercially reasonable 
we do not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses such as loss from riots  war or acts of god 
certain of the properties in our portfolio are located in areas known to be seismically active or subject to hurricanes and we believe we have appropriate insurance for those risks  although they are subject to higher deductibles than ordinary property insurance 
most of our hotel management agreements provide that we are responsible for obtaining and maintaining property insurance  business interruption insurance  flood insurance  earthquake insurance if the hotel is located in an earthquake prone zone as determined by the us geological survey and other customary types of insurance related to hotels and the hotel manager is

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we may currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected 
risks related to our business and operations our business model  especially our concentration in premium full service hotels  can be highly volatile 
we own hotels  a very different asset class from many other reits 
a typical office reit  for example  has long term leases with third party tenants  which provide a relatively stable long term stream of revenue 
our trs  on the other hand  does not enter into a lease with a hotel manager 
instead  our trs engages the hotel manager pursuant to a management agreement and pays the manager a fee for managing the hotel 
the trs receives all the operating profit or losses at the hotel 
moreover  virtually all hotel guests stay at the hotel for only a few nights  so the rate and occupancy at each of our hotels changes every day 
as a result  we may have highly volatile earnings 
in addition to fluctuations related to our business model  our hotels are and will continue to be subject to various long term operating risks common to the hotel industry  many of which are beyond our control  including dependence on business and commercial travelers and tourism  both of which vary with consumer and business confidence in the strength of the economy  competition from other hotels located in the markets in which we own properties  an over supply or over building of hotels in the markets in which we own properties which could adversely affect occupancy rates  revenues and profits at our hotels  increases in energy and transportation costs and other expenses affecting travel  which may affect travel patterns and reduce the number of business and commercial travelers and tourists  
table of contents increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors that may not be offset by increased room rates  and changes in governmental laws and regulations  fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance 
in addition  our hotels are mostly in the premium full service segment of the hotel business  which  historically  tends to have the strongest operating results in a growing economy and the weakest results in a contracting or slow growth economy when many travelers might curtail travel or choose lower cost hotels 
in periods of weak demand  profitability is negatively affected by the relatively high fixed costs of operating premium full service hotels as compared to other classes of hotels 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
our portfolio is highly concentrated in a handful of core markets 
during  of our earnings from continuing operations were derived from our hotels in six major cities new york city  boston  chicago  denver  los angeles and atlanta and three destination resorts frenchman s reef  vail marriott  and the lodge at sonoma  with of our earnings from continuing operations being derived from our properties in new york city 
as such  the operations of these hotels particularly the operations of new york city properties will have a material impact on our overall results of operations 
this concentration in our portfolio may lead to increased volatility in our results 
if lodging fundamentals in any of these cities are poor compared to the united states as a whole  the popularity of any of these destination resorts decreases  or a manmade or natural disaster or casualty or other damage occurs to one of our key hotels  our overall results of operations may be adversely affected 
economic conditions may adversely affect the lodging industry 
the performance of the lodging industry has historically been linked to key macroeconomic indicators  such as gdp growth  employment  corporate earnings and investment  and travel demand 
as these indicators improve  we anticipate that lodging operating fundamentals will improve as well 
however  if the economic recovery should falter and there is an extended period of economic weakness  our occupancy rates  revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
our hotels are subject to significant competition 
currently  the markets where our hotels are located are very competitive 
however  a material increase in the supply of new hotel rooms to a market can quickly destabilize that market and existing hotels can experience rapidly decreasing revpar and profitability 
if such over building occurs in one or more of our major markets  we may experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in particular  we own the vail marriott mountain resort spa which has been impacted by a new four seasons hotel  which opened in late  and the expansion of the sebastian hotel  both of which compete with the vail marriott for guests 
in addition  the four seasons hotel has substantial meeting space and competes with our hotel for groups planning meetings in vail 
additionally  over  rooms have been  or will be  added to the manhattan hotel market  including an expected  room increase in supply in although many of these hotels are not located in our specific sub markets of manhattan  the operating performance of our manhattan hotels has nevertheless been impacted by the addition of this new supply 
investments in hotels are illiquid and we may not be able to respond in a timely fashion to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 
because real estate investments are relatively illiquid  our ability to promptly sell one or more hotel properties or investments in our portfolio in response to changing economic  financial and investment conditions may be limited 
the real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control  including adverse changes in international  national  regional and local economic and market conditions  changes in supply of competitive hotels  changes in interest rates and in the availability  cost and terms of debt financing  changes in governmental laws and regulations  fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations  fiscal policies and ordinances  
table of contents the ongoing need for capital improvements  particularly in older structures  changes in operating expenses  and civil unrest  acts of god  including earthquakes  floods  hurricanes and other natural disasters and acts of war or terrorism  including the consequences of terrorist acts such as those that occurred on september   which may result in uninsured losses 
it may be in the best interest of our stockholders to sell one or more of our hotels in the future 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any hotel property or investment at an acceptable price or otherwise on reasonable terms and conditions 
we also cannot predict the length of time that will be necessary to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a hotel property or loan 
these facts and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our hotel properties could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in the event of natural disasters  terrorist attacks  significant military actions  outbreaks of contagious diseases or other events for which we may not have adequate insurance  our operations may suffer 
one of our major hotels  frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort  is located on the side of a cliff facing the ocean in the us virgin islands  which is in the so called hurricane belt in the caribbean 
the hotel was partially destroyed by a hurricane in the mid s and since then has been damaged by subsequent hurricanes  including hurricane earl in in addition  four of our hotels  the los angeles airport marriott  the torrance marriott south bay  the lodge at sonoma  a renaissance resort spa and the renaissance charleston historic district  are located in areas that are seismically active 
finally  eleven of our hotels are located in metropolitan markets that have been  or may in the future be  targets of actual or threatened terrorist attacks  including new york city  chicago  boston and los angeles 
these hotels are material to our financial results  having constituted approximately of our total revenues in additionally  even in the absence of direct physical damage to our hotels  the occurrence of any natural disasters  terrorist attacks  significant military actions  outbreaks of diseases  such as hn  sars  the avian bird flu or legionnaires disease  or other casualty events  will likely have a material adverse effect on business and commercial travelers and tourists  the economy generally and the hotel and tourism industries in particular 
while we cannot predict the impact of the occurrence of any of these events  such impact could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
we have acquired and intend to maintain comprehensive insurance on each of our hotels  including liability  terrorism  fire and extended coverage  of the type and amount we believe are customarily obtained for or by hotel owners 
we cannot assure you that such coverage will be available at reasonable rates or with reasonable deductibles 
for example  frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort has a high deductible if it is damaged due to a named wind storm 
various types of catastrophic losses  like earthquakes  floods  losses from foreign terrorist activities  or losses from domestic terrorist activities may not be insurable or are generally not insured because of economic infeasibility  legal restrictions or the policies of insurers 
future lenders may require such insurance and our failure to obtain such insurance could constitute a default under loan agreements 
depending on our access to capital  liquidity and the value of the properties securing the affected loan in relation to the balance of the loan  a default could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and ability to obtain future financing 
in the event of a substantial loss  our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the full current market value or replacement cost of our lost investment 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a hotel  as well as the anticipated future revenue from that particular hotel 
in that event  we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations secured by or related to the property 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a hotel after it has been damaged or destroyed 
under those circumstances  the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position with regard to the damaged or destroyed property 
with or without insurance  damage to any of our hotels  or to the hotel industry generally  due to fire  hurricane  earthquake  terrorism  outbreaks such as hn  sars  the avian bird flu or legionnaires disease  or other man made or natural disasters or casualty events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

table of contents we are subject to risks associated with our ongoing need for renovations and capital improvements as well as financing for such expenditures 
in order to remain competitive  our hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements  including replacements  from time to time  of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
these capital improvements may give rise to the following risks construction cost overruns and delays  a possible shortage of available cash to fund capital improvements and the related possibility that financing for these capital improvements may not be available to us on affordable terms  the renovation investment failing to produce the returns on investment that we expect  disruptions in the operations of the hotel as well as in demand for the hotel while capital improvements are underway  and disputes with franchisors hotel managers regarding compliance with relevant management franchise agreements 
the costs of these capital improvements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in addition  we may not be able to fund capital improvements or acquisitions solely from cash provided from our operating activities because we generally must distribute at least of our reit taxable income  determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains  each year to maintain our reit tax status 
as a result  our ability to fund capital expenditures  or investments through retained earnings  is very limited 
consequently  we rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund our investments and capital improvements 
these sources of funds may not be available on reasonable terms and conditions 
we may be subject to risks associated with a renovation project planned for the renaissance worthington 
we are planning to undertake a comprehensive repair of the concrete fa ade at the renaissance worthington 
this renovation project gives rise to several risks  including construction cost overruns and delays  closure of portions of the hotel for longer than expected  and reduction in demand for the portion of the hotel that remains open while the renovation project is underway 
these costs and delays could have a material adverse effect on occupancy rates  revenues and profits at the hotel 
there are several specific risks associated with the ownership of frenchman s reef 
frenchman s reef is located on the side of a cliff facing the ocean in the united states virgin islands  which is in the so called hurricane belt in the caribbean 
it was partially destroyed by a hurricane in the mid s and since then has been damaged by subsequent hurricanes  including hurricane earl in while we maintain insurance against wind damage in an amount we believe is customarily obtained for or by hotel owners  frenchman s reef has a million deductible if it is damaged due to a named windstorm event  therefore  we are self insured for losses up to million caused by a named windstorm event 
while we cannot predict whether there will be another hurricane that will impact this hotel  if there were  then it could have a material adverse affect on the operations of this hotel 
further  in the event of a substantial loss  our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the full current market value or replacement cost of the hotel 
should a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in frenchman s reef  as well as the anticipated future revenue and profits of this hotel 
in that event  we might nevertheless remain obligated for mortgage debt related to frenchman s reef 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a hotel after it has been damaged or destroyed 
under those circumstances  the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position with regard to the damaged or destroyed property 
part of the renovation and repositioning program undertaken at the hotel in included a redesign to the mechanical plant to allow the hotel to generate its own electricity in order to significantly reduce both the kilowatt hour consumption and the cost per kilowatt hour  however  the hotel still depends on oil to generate electricity 
if the price of oil were to increase  the cost of utilities would likely increase dramatically and this would have a significant impact on the results of operation at the hotel 
also  if the hotel s self generation system fails  the hotel will be forced to utilize service from local utility providers which are prone to disruptions  including power outages from time to time 
such disruptions could adversely affect occupancy rates  revenues and profits at the hotel 

table of contents frenchman s reef benefits from a tax holiday  which permits us to pay income taxes at percent of the statutory tax rate of percent in the us virgin islands 
the tax holiday expires in february and there can be no assurance that such tax exemptions or similar exemptions will be secured at the expiration of the tax holiday 
we may have difficulty executing our investment strategy associated with our purchase of the allerton loan 
we acquired the allerton loan with the expectation of subsequently foreclosing on  or otherwise taking control of  the allerton hotel  which secures the mortgage loan 
on may   the borrower under the loan filed for bankruptcy protection in the northern district of illinois under chapter of title of the u 
s 
code  usc et seq  as amended 
the filing of the bankruptcy proceedings had the effect of staying the foreclosure proceedings that we had previously filed against the borrower 
as a result  we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully foreclose on  or otherwise take control of  the allerton hotel 
if we are unable to acquire the allerton hotel  we may hold the loan as a debt investment after completion of the bankruptcy proceedings 
if this is the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings  we are subject to several risks  including i the risk that the bankruptcy court reduces the principal amount of the loan based on a claim of equitable subordination or other claim  ii the risk that the bankruptcy court orders a restructuring of the loan at below market terms and iii the risk of another borrower default 
this investment and any other similar investment in mortgage loans that we may undertake in the future may negatively affect our financial condition due to the impact of losses from non performing loans  and they are subject to increased risks of loss  including risks associated with foreclosure 
foreclosure on a mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process  which could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on a foreclosed mortgage loan 
at any time prior to or during the foreclosure proceedings  the borrower may file for bankruptcy  which would have the effect of staying the foreclosure actions and further delaying the foreclosure process 
foreclosure may also create a negative public perception of the related mortgaged property  resulting in a diminution of its value 
these types of investments and associated foreclosure actions may also require a substantial amount of resources and negotiations  which may divert the attention of our management team from other activities 
we face risks associated with the development of a hotel by a third party developer 
we are party to a purchase and sale agreement to acquire  upon completion expected in  a hotel property under development on west nd street in times square  new york city 
the hotel is expected to contain guest rooms 
we are exposed to the risk that the third party developer will fail to substantially complete the development of the hotel in accordance with the contractual scope or that the developer defaults under another obligation set forth in the purchase and sale agreement with us 
we are also exposed to the risk that the developer will default on an obligation to a lender  which may have a security interest in the property senior to us 
in either of these cases  we may lose the opportunity to acquire the hotel and may have no recourse to the developer 
in addition  the hotel is not expected to be opened for approximately to months 
if we acquire this hotel  there can be no assurance that the market where it is located will not be experiencing a downturn when the acquisition is completed and the hotel may not perform as we expect 
our hotel portfolio is not diverse by brand or manager and there are risks associated with using marriott s brands on most of our hotels and having marriott manage most of our hotels 
twenty of our current hotels utilize brands owned by marriott 
as a result  our success is dependent in part on the continued success of marriott and its brands 
we believe that building brand value is critical to increasing demand and building customer loyalty 
if market recognition or the positive perception of these marriott brands is reduced or compromised  the goodwill associated with marriott branded hotels and the results of operations of our hotels may be adversely affected 
as a result  we could experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
our results of operations are highly dependent on the management of our hotel properties by third party hotel management companies 
in order to qualify as a reit  we cannot operate our hotel properties or control the daily operations of our hotel properties 
our trs lessees may not operate these hotel properties and  therefore  they must enter into third party hotel management agreements with one or more eligible independent contractors 
thus  third party hotel management companies that enter into management contracts with our trs lessees control the daily operations of our hotel properties 
under the terms of the hotel management agreements that we have entered into  or that we will enter into in the future  our ability to participate in operating decisions regarding our hotel properties is limited 
we currently rely  and will continue to rely  on these hotel management companies to adequately operate our hotel properties under the terms of the hotel management agreements 
we do not have the authority to require any hotel property to be operated in a particular manner or to govern any 
table of contents particular aspect of its operations for instance  setting room rates and cost structures 
thus  even if we believe our hotel properties are being operated inefficiently or in a manner that does not result in satisfactory occupancy rates  adrs and operating profits  we may not have sufficient rights under our hotel management agreements to enable us to force the hotel management company to change its method of operation 
we can only seek redress if a hotel management company violates the terms of the applicable hotel management agreement with the trs lessee  and then only to the extent of the remedies provided for under the terms of the hotel management agreement 
our current management agreements are generally non terminable  subject to certain exceptions for cause  and in the event that we need to replace any of our hotel management companies pursuant to termination for cause  we may experience significant disruptions at the affected properties  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the risk that we may have difficulty financing such properties  be forced to sell such properties for a lower price or lose such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 
we hold a leasehold interest in the land underlying five of our hotels bethesda marriott suites  courtyard manhattan fifth avenue  the salt lake city marriott downtown  the westin boston waterfront hotel  and the hilton minneapolis  the parking lot at another of our hotels renaissance worthington and the golf courses at two of our hotels marriott griffin gate resort and oak brook hills marriott resort 
we may acquire additional hotels in the future subject to ground leases 
in the past  from time to time  secured lenders have been unwilling to lend  or otherwise charged higher interest rates  for loans secured by a leasehold mortgage compared to loans secured by a fee simple mortgage 
in addition  at any given time  investors may be disinterested in buying properties subject to a ground lease and may pay a lower price for such properties than for a comparable property in fee simple or they may not purchase such properties at any price whatsoever  so we may find that we will have a difficult time selling a property subject to a ground lease or may receive lower proceeds from a sale 
finally  as the lessee under our ground leases  we are exposed to the possibility of losing the hotel  or a portion of the hotel  upon termination  or an earlier breach by us  of the ground lease  which could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
due to restrictions in our hotel management agreements  franchise agreements  mortgage agreements and ground leases  we may not be able to sell our hotels at the highest possible price or at all 
our current hotel management agreements are long term and contain certain restrictions on selling our hotels  which may affect the value of our hotels 
the hotel management agreements that we have entered into  and those we expect to enter into in the future  contain provisions restricting our ability to dispose of our hotels which  in turn  may have an adverse affect on the value of our hotels 
our hotel management agreements generally prohibit the sale of a hotel to certain competitors of the manager  purchasers who are insufficiently capitalized  or purchasers who might jeopardize certain liquor or gaming licenses 
in addition  our current hotel management agreements contain initial terms ranging from five to forty years and certain agreements have renewal periods of five to forty five years which are exercisable at the option of the property manager 
because our hotels would have to be sold subject to the applicable hotel management agreement  the term length of a hotel management agreement may deter some potential purchasers and could adversely impact the price realized from any such sale 
to the extent we receive lower sale proceeds  we could experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
our mortgage agreements contain certain provisions that may limit our ability to sell our hotels 
in order to assign or transfer our rights and obligations under certain of our mortgage agreements  we generally must obtain the consent of the lender  pay a fee equal to a fixed percentage of the outstanding loan balance  and pay any costs incurred by the lender in connection with any such assignment or transfer 

table of contents these provisions of our mortgage agreements may limit our ability to sell our hotels which  in turn  could adversely impact the price realized from any such sale 
to the extent we receive lower sale proceeds  we could experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
our ground leases contain certain provisions that may limit our ability to sell our hotels 
our ground lease agreements with respect to bethesda marriott suites  salt lake city marriott downtown  the westin boston waterfront hotel  and the hilton minneapolis require the consent of the lessor for assignment or transfer 
these provisions of our ground leases may limit our ability to sell our hotels which  in turn  could adversely impact the price realized from any such sale 
in addition  at any given time  investors may be disinterested in buying properties subject to a ground lease and may pay a lower price for such properties than for a comparable property in fee simple or they may not purchase such properties at any price 
accordingly  we may find it difficult to sell a property subject to a ground lease or may receive lower proceeds from any such sale 
to the extent we receive lower sale proceeds  we could experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
the failure of tenants under our retail leases at our hotels may adversely affect our results of operation 
on occasion  tenants at our hotel properties may fail to make rent payments as and when due 
generally  we hold security deposits in connection with each of the leases which may be applied in the event that the tenant under the lease fails or is unable to make rent payments  however  these security deposits do not provide us with cash flow to pay distributions or for other purposes 
in the event that a tenant continually fails to make rent payments  the security deposits may be applied in full to the non payment of rents and we face the risk of being able to recover only a portion of the rents due to us or being unable to recover any amounts whatsoever 
we face competition for hotel acquisitions and investments and we may not be successful in identifying or completing hotel acquisitions and investments that meet our criteria  which may impede our growth 
one component of our long term business strategy is expansion through hotel acquisitions and investments 
however  we may not be successful in identifying or completing acquisitions or investments that are consistent with our strategy 
we compete with institutional pension funds  private equity funds  reits  hotel companies and others who are engaged in hotel acquisitions and investments 
this competition for hotel investments may increase the price we pay for hotels and these competitors may succeed in acquiring those hotels that we seek to acquire 
furthermore  our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater financial resources  may not be dependent on third party financing or the capital markets  may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy 
in addition  the number of entities competing for suitable hotels may increase in the future  which would increase demand for these hotels and the prices we must pay to acquire them 
if we pay higher prices for hotels  our returns on investment and profitability may be reduced 
also  future acquisitions of hotels  hotel companies or hotel investments may not yield the returns we expect  especially if we cannot obtain financing without paying higher borrowing costs  and may result in stockholder dilution 
we may fail to successfully integrate and operate newly acquired hotels 
our ability to successfully integrate and operate newly acquired hotels is subject to the following risks we may not possess the same level of familiarity with the dynamics and market conditions of any new markets that we may enter  which could result in us paying too much for hotels in new markets  market conditions may result in lower than expected occupancy and room rates  we may acquire hotels without any recourse  or with only limited recourse  for liabilities  whether known or unknown  such as clean up of environmental contamination  claims by tenants  vendors or other persons against the former owners of the hotels and claims for indemnification by general partners  directors  officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the hotels  we may need to spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or renovations to our newly acquired hotels  and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions into our existing operations 

table of contents if we cannot operate acquired hotels to meet our goals or expectations  our business  financial condition  results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected 
our success depends on senior executive officers whose continued service is not guaranteed 
we depend on the efforts and expertise of our senior executive officers to manage our day to day operations and strategic business direction 
the loss of any of their services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
seasonality of the hotel business can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our earnings 
the hotel industry is seasonal in nature 
generally  our earnings are higher in the second and fourth quarters 
as a result  we may have to enter into short term borrowings in order to offset these fluctuations in earnings and to make distributions to our stockholders 
we rely on technology in our operations and failures  inadequacies or interruptions to our service could harm our business 
the execution of our business strategy is heavily dependent on the use of technologies and systems  including the internet  to access  store  transmit  deliver and manage information and processes 
although we believe we have taken commercially reasonable steps to protect the security of our systems  there can be no assurance that such security measures will prevent failures  inadequacies or interruptions in system services  or that system security will not be breached 
disruptions in service  system shutdowns and security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may be adversely affected by increased use of business related technology which may reduce the need for business related travel 
the increased use of teleconference and video conference technology by businesses could result in decreased business travel as companies increase the use of technologies that allow multiple parties from different locations to participate in meetings without traveling to a centralized meeting location 
to the extent that such technologies play an increased role in day to day business and the necessity for business related travel decreases  hotel room demand may decrease and our financial condition  results of operations  the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected 
risks related to the economy and credit markets the lack of availability and terms of financing could adversely impact the amounts  sources and costs of capital available to us 
the ownership of hotels is very capital intensive 
we finance the acquisition of our hotels with a mixture of equity and long term debt while we traditionally finance renovations and operating needs with cash provided from operations or with borrowings from our corporate credit facility 
typically  when we acquire a hotel  we seek a five to ten year loan secured by a mortgage on the hotel 
these loans have a large balloon payment due at their maturity 
generally  we find it more efficient to place a significant amount of debt on a small number of our hotels and we try to maintain a significant number of our hotels unencumbered 
during periods of economic recession  it could be difficult for us to borrow money 
over the last ten years  a significant percentage of hotel loans were made by lenders who quickly sold such loans to securitized lending vehicles  such as commercial mortgage backed security cmbs pools 
if the market for new cmbs issuances results in cmbs lenders making very few loans  there is a risk that the debt capital available to hotel owners could be dramatically reduced 
an uncertain environment in the lodging industry and the economy generally could result in declines in our average daily room rates  occupancy and revpar  and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the performance of the lodging industry has traditionally been closely linked with the general economy 
while the economic climate appears to be improving  a stall in economic growth or an economic recession would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if a property s occupancy or room rates drop to the point where its revenues are less than its operating expenses  then we would be required to spend additional funds in order to cover that property s operating expenses 
in addition  if the operating results decline at our hotels secured by mortgage debt there may not be sufficient operating profit 
table of contents from the hotel to cover the debt service on the mortgage 
in such a case  we may be forced to choose from a number of unfavorable options  including using corporate cash  drawing on our corporate credit facility  selling a hotel on disadvantageous terms  including an unattractive price  or defaulting on the mortgage debt and permitting the lender to foreclose 
any one of these options could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders 
the market price of our common stock could be volatile and could decline  resulting in a substantial or complete loss on our common stockholders investment 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile in the past  and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
risks related to our debt and financing our existing indebtedness contains financial covenants that could limit our operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
our existing property level debt instruments contain restrictions including cash management provisions that may under circumstances specified in the loan agreements prohibit our subsidiaries that own our hotels from making distributions or paying dividends  repaying loans to us or other subsidiaries or transferring any of their assets to us or another subsidiary 
failure to meet our financial covenants could result from  among other things  changes in our results of operations  the incurrence of additional debt or changes in general economic conditions 
in addition  this could cause one or more of our lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
the terms of our debt may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 
our credit facility contains financial covenants that may constrain our ability to sell assets and make distributions to our stockholders 
our corporate credit facility contains several financial covenants  the most constraining of which limits the amount of debt we may incur compared to the value of our hotels our leverage covenant and the amount of debt service we pay compared to our cash flow our debt service coverage covenant 
if we were to default under either of these covenants  the lenders may require us to repay all amounts then outstanding under our credit facility and may terminate our credit facility 
these two financial covenants constrain us from incurring material amounts of additional debt or from selling properties that generate a material amount of income 
in addition our credit facility requires that we maintain a portion of our hotels as unencumbered assets 
the pool of unencumbered assets must include the westin boston waterfront hotel  the vail marriott mountain resort spa and the conrad chicago 
during the term of the credit facility  we are prohibited from selling the westin boston waterfront hotel and may only sell the vail marriott mountain resort spa and conrad chicago under limited circumstances 
many of our existing mortgage debt agreements contain cash trap provisions that could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
certain of our loan agreements contain cash trap provisions that may get triggered if the performance of our hotels decline further 
when these provisions are triggered  substantially all of the profit generated by our hotels is deposited directly into lockbox accounts and then swept into cash management accounts for the benefit of our various lenders 
cash is distributed to us only after certain items are paid  including deposits into leasing and maintenance reserves and the payment of debt service  insurance  taxes  operating expenses  and extraordinary capital expenditures and leasing expenses 
this could affect our liquidity and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
there is refinancing risk associated with our debt 
our typical debt contains limited principal amortization  therefore the vast majority of the principal must be repaid at the maturity of the loan in a so called balloon payment 
in the event that we do not have sufficient funds to repay the debt at the maturity of these loans  we will need to refinance this debt 
if the credit environment is constrained at the time of our debt maturities  we would have a very difficult time refinancing debt 
in addition  we locked in our fixed rate debt at a point in time when we were able to obtain favorable interest rate  principal amortization and other terms 
when we refinance our debt  prevailing interest rates and other factors may result in paying a greater amount of debt service  which will adversely affect our cash flow  and  consequently  
table of contents our cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms  we may be forced to choose from a number of unfavorable options 
these options include agreeing to otherwise unfavorable financing terms on one or more of our unencumbered assets  selling one or more hotels at disadvantageous terms  including unattractive prices  or defaulting on the mortgage and permitting the lender to foreclose 
any one of these options could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
if we default on our secured debt in the future  the lenders may foreclose on our hotels 
all of our indebtedness  except our credit facility  is secured by single property first mortgages on the applicable property 
if we default on any of the secured loans  the lender will be able to foreclose on the property pledged to the relevant lender under that loan 
while we have maintained certain of our hotels unencumbered by mortgage debt  we have a relatively high loan to value on a number of our hotels which are subject to mortgage loans and  as a result  those mortgaged hotels may be at an increased risk of default and foreclosure 
in addition to losing the property  a foreclosure may result in recognition of taxable income 
under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  a foreclosure of property securing nonrecourse debt would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage 
if the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property  we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure even though we did not receive any cash proceeds 
as a result  we may be required to identify and utilize other sources of cash for distributions to our stockholders 
if this occurs  our financial condition  cash flow and ability to satisfy our other debt obligations or ability to pay distributions may be adversely affected 
future debt service obligations may adversely affect our operating results  require us to liquidate our properties  jeopardize our ability to make cash distributions necessary to maintain our tax status as a reit and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in the future  we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt  including secured debt 
while borrowing costs are currently low  borrowing costs on new and refinanced debt may be more expensive 
our existing debt  and any additional debt borrowed in the future could subject us to many risks  including the risks that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or to make cash distributions necessary to maintain our tax status as a reit  we may be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions  we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our debt  thereby reducing the cash available for distribution to our stockholders  funds available for operations and capital expenditures  future investment opportunities or other purposes  the terms of any refinancing is likely not as favorable as the terms of the debt being refinanced  and the use of leverage could adversely affect our stock price and the ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
if we violate covenants in our future indebtedness agreements  we could be required to repay all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be unable to arrange financing for such repayment on favorable terms  if at all 
higher interest rates could increase debt service requirements on our floating rate debt  if any  and refinanced debt and could reduce the amounts available for distribution to our stockholders  as well as reduce funds available for our operations  future investment opportunities or other purposes 
we may obtain in the future one or more forms of interest rate protection in the form of swap agreements  interest rate cap contracts or similar agreements to hedge against the possible negative effects of interest rate fluctuations 
however  hedging is expensive  there is no perfect hedge  and we cannot assure you that any hedging will adequately mitigate the adverse effects of interest rate increases or that counterparties under these agreements will honor their obligations 
in addition  we may be subject to risks of default by hedging counter parties 
risks related to regulation  taxes and the environment noncompliance with governmental regulations could adversely affect our operating results 
environmental matters and climate change 

table of contents our hotels are  and the hotels we acquire in the future will be  subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws 
under these laws  courts and government agencies may have the authority to require us  as owner of a contaminated property  to clean up the property  even if we did not know of or were not responsible for the contamination 
these laws also apply to persons who owned a property at the time it became contaminated 
in addition to the costs of cleanup  environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and  therefore  an owner s ability to borrow funds using the property as collateral or to sell the property 
under the environmental laws  courts and government agencies also have the authority to require that a person who sent waste to a waste disposal facility  such as a landfill or an incinerator  pay for the clean up of that facility if it becomes contaminated and threatens human health or the environment 
a person who arranges for the disposal or treatment  or transports for disposal or treatment  a hazardous substance at a property owned by another person may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released into the environment at that property 
furthermore  various court decisions have established that third parties may recover damages for injury caused by property contamination 
for instance  a person exposed to asbestos while staying in a hotel may seek to recover damages if he or she suffers injury from the asbestos 
lastly  some of these environmental laws restrict the use of a property or place conditions on various activities 
for example  certain laws require a business using chemicals such as swimming pool chemicals at a hotel to manage them carefully and to notify local officials that the chemicals are being used 
we could be responsible for the costs associated with a contaminated property 
the costs to clean up a contaminated property  to defend against a claim  or to comply with environmental laws could be material and could adversely affect the funds available for distribution to our stockholders 
we cannot assure you that future laws or regulations will not impose material environmental liabilities or that the current environmental condition of our hotels will not be affected by the condition of the properties in the vicinity of our hotels such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks or by third parties unrelated to us 
we may face liability regardless of our knowledge of the contamination  the timing of the contamination  the cause of the contamination  or the party responsible for the contamination of the property 
although we have taken and will take commercially reasonable steps to assess the condition of our properties  there may be unknown environmental problems associated with our properties 
if environmental contamination exists on our properties  we could become subject to strict  joint and several liability for the contamination by virtue of our ownership interest 
in addition  we are obligated to indemnify our lenders for any liability they may incur in connection with a contaminated property 
the presence of hazardous substances or petroleum contamination on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property and could cause us to incur substantial remediation costs 
the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 
numerous treaties  laws and regulations have been enacted to regulate or limit carbon emissions 
changes in the regulations and legislation relating to climate change  and complying with such laws and regulations  may require us to make significant investments in our hotels and could result in increased energy costs at our properties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 
americans with disabilities act and other changes in governmental rules and regulations 
under the americans with disabilities act of  as amended  or the ada  all public accommodations must meet various federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
compliance with the ada s requirements could require removal of access barriers  and non compliance could result in the us government imposing fines or private litigants winning damages 
if we are required to make substantial modifications to our hotels  whether to comply with the ada or other changes in governmental rules and regulations  our financial condition  results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected 
our hotel properties may contain or develop harmful mold  which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs 
table of contents of remediating the problem 
when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  mold growth may occur  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants 
concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing  as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms  including allergic reactions 
as a result  the presence of mold to which our hotel guests or employees could be exposed at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property  which would reduce our cash available for distribution 
in addition  exposure to mold by our guests or employees  management company employees or others could expose us to liability if property damage or adverse health concerns arise 
risks related to our status as a reit we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a reit 
we believe we are qualified to be taxed as a reit for our taxable year ended december   and we expect to continue to qualify as a reit for future taxable years  but we cannot assure you that we have qualified  or will remain qualified  as a reit 
the reit qualification requirements are extremely complex and official interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification as a reit are limited 
certain aspects of our reit qualification are beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so that we can remain qualified as a reit 
at any time  new laws  interpretations  or court decisions may change the federal tax laws or the federal income tax consequences of our qualification as a reit 
moreover  our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election  without the approval of our stockholders  if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions  or otherwise cease to be a reit  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates 
we might need to borrow money or sell assets in order to pay any such tax 
also  we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income and we would no longer be compelled to make distributions under the code 
unless we were entitled to relief under certain federal income tax laws  we could not re elect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit but are eligible for certain relief provisions  then we may retain our status as a reit but we may be required to pay a penalty tax  which could be substantial 
maintaining our reit qualification contains certain restrictions and drawbacks 
complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 
to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the sources of our income  the nature and diversification of our assets  the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock 
in order to meet these tests  we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities 
for example  we may not lease to our trs any hotel which contains gaming 
thus  compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely to maximize profits 
to qualify as a reit we must meet annual distribution requirements 
in order to remain qualified as a reit  we generally are required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income  determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains  each year to our stockholders 
to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under federal tax laws 
as a result of differences between cash flow and the accrual of income and expenses for tax purposes  or nondeductible expenditures  for example  our reit taxable income in any given year could exceed our cash available for distribution 
accordingly  we may be required to borrow money or sell assets to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid federal corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax in a particular year 
the formation of our trss and trs lessees increases our overall tax liability 

table of contents our domestic trss are subject to federal and state income tax on their taxable income 
the taxable income of our trs lessees currently consists and generally will continue to consist of revenues from the hotels leased by our trs lessees plus  in certain cases  key money payments amounts paid to us by a hotel management company in exchange for the right to manage a hotel we acquire and yield support payments  net of the operating expenses for such properties and rent payments to us 
such taxes could be substantial 
our non us trss also may be subject to tax in jurisdictions where they operate 
we will be subject to a excise tax on transactions with our trss that are not conducted on an arm s length basis 
for example  to the extent that the rent paid by one of our trs lessees exceeds an arm s length rental amount  such amount is potentially subject to this excise tax 
while we believe we structure all of our leases on an arm s length basis  upon an audit  the irs might disagree with our conclusion 
you may be restricted from transferring our common stock 
in order to maintain our reit qualification  among other requirements  no more than in value of our outstanding stock may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the federal income tax laws to include certain entities during the last half of any taxable year 
in addition  the reit rules generally prohibit a manager of one of our hotels from owning  directly or indirectly  more than of our stock and a person who holds or more of our stock from also holding  directly or indirectly  more than of any such hotel management company 
to qualify for and preserve reit status  our charter contains an aggregate share ownership limit and a common share ownership limit 
generally  any shares of our stock owned by affiliated owners will be added together for purposes of the aggregate share ownership limit  and any shares of common stock owned by affiliated owners will be added together for purposes of the common share ownership limit 
if anyone transfers or owns shares in a way that would violate the aggregate share ownership limit or the common share ownership limit unless such ownership limits have been waived by our board of directors  or would prevent us from continuing to qualify as a reit under the federal income tax laws  those shares instead will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and will be either redeemed by us or sold to a person whose ownership of the shares will not violate the aggregate share ownership limit or the common share ownership limit 
if this transfer to a trust would not be effective to prevent a violation of the ownership restrictions in our charter  then the initial intended transfer or ownership will be null and void from the outset 
the intended transferee or owner of those shares will be deemed never to have owned the shares 
anyone who acquires or owns shares in violation of the aggregate share ownership limit  the common share ownership limit unless such ownership limits have been waived by our board of directors or the other restrictions on transfer or ownership in our charter bears the risk of a financial loss when the shares are redeemed or sold if the market price of our stock falls between the date of purchase and the date of redemption or sale 
even if we qualify as a reit  in certain circumstances  we may be subject to federal and state income taxes  which would reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit  we may be subject to federal income taxes or state taxes in various circumstances 
for example  net income from a prohibited transaction will be subject to a tax 
in addition  we may not be able to distribute all of our income in any given year  which would result in corporate level taxes  and we may not make sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes 
we may also decide to retain certain gains from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay income tax directly on such gains 
in that event  our stockholders would be required to include such gains in income and would receive a corresponding credit for their share of taxes paid by us 
we may also be subject to us state and local and non us taxes on our income or property  either directly or at the level of our operating partnership or the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets 
in addition  we may be subject to federal  state local or non us taxes in other various circumstances 
any federal or state taxes we pay will reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
reit dividends generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates that apply to certain other corporate dividends 
tax legislation enacted at the end of extended the maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income received by individuals from domestic and certain foreign corporations through however  dividends from reits generally do not qualify as qualified dividend income and  therefore  are taxed at normal ordinary income tax rates 
although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends paid by reits  the preferential rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stock of non reit corporations that pay dividends  which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits  including our common stock 
it is unclear whether this reduced tax rate will be extended beyond and if so  at what rate 
foreign investors may be subject to foreign investment real property tax act  or firpta  tax on certain distributions 
table of contents and on the sale of our common stock if certain exceptions do not apply 
a foreign person disposing of a us real property interest  or usrpi  including shares of a us corporation whose assets consist principally of usrpis  is generally subject to a tax  known as firpta tax  on the gain recognized on the disposition 
firpta tax does not apply  however  to the disposition of stock in a reit if the reit is a domestically controlled qualified investment entity 
a domestically controlled qualified investment entity includes a reit in which  at all times during a specified testing period  less than in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign persons 
even if we do not qualify as a domestically controlled qualified investment entity  a foreign person s sale of our common stock will generally not be subject to tax under firpta as a sale of a usrpi  provided that our common stock is regularly traded  as defined by applicable treasury regulations  on an established securities market at the time of the sale  and the selling foreign person held or less of our outstanding common stock at all times during a specified testing period 
if we were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled qualified investment entity at a time when our common stock is not regularly traded on an established securities market  gain realized by a foreign person on a sale of our common stock would be subject to firpta tax and applicable withholding 
no assurance can be given that we will be a domestically controlled qualified investment entity or that our common stock will continue to be regularly traded on an established securities market 
additionally  any distributions we make to our foreign shareholders that are attributable to gain from the sale of any usrpi will also generally be subject to firpta tax and applicable withholding  unless our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the united states at the time of the distribution and the recipient did not own more than of our common stock at any time during the year preceding the distribution 
legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect our stockholders 
in recent years  numerous legislative  judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax laws applicable to investments in reits and similar entities 
additional changes to applicable tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future  and we cannot assure our stockholders that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder 
any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our common stock 
all stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisors with respect to the status of legislative  regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our common stock 
risks related to our organization and structure provisions of our charter may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company 
our charter provides that no person may beneficially own more than of the aggregate outstanding shares of our common stock or more than of the value of the aggregate outstanding shares of our capital stock  except certain look through entities  such as mutual funds  which may beneficially own up to of the aggregate outstanding shares of our common stock or up to of the value of the aggregate outstanding shares of our capital stock 
our board of directors has waived this ownership limitation for certain investors in the past 
our bylaws waive this ownership limitation for certain other classes of investors 
these ownership limitations may prevent an acquisition of control of our company by a third party without our board of directors approval  even if our stockholders believe the change of control is in their best interests 
our charter also authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of common stock and up to  shares of preferred stock  to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to set the preferences  rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares 
furthermore  our board of directors may  without any action by the stockholders  amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue 
issuances of additional shares of stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium to the market price of our common stock or otherwise be in our stockholders best interests 
certain advance notice provisions of our bylaws may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company 
our bylaws provide that a with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders  nominations of individuals for election to our board of directors and the proposal of other business to be considered by stockholders may be made only i pursuant to our notice of the meeting  ii by the board of directors or iii by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures set forth in the bylaws and b with respect to special meetings of stockholders  only the business specified in our notice of meeting may be brought before the meeting of stockholders and nominations of individuals for election to the board of directors may be made only a by the board of directors or b provided that the board of directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting  by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice provisions set forth in the bylaws 
these advance notice provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium to the market price of 
table of contents our common stock or otherwise be in our stockholders best interests 
provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company 
the maryland general corporation law  or the mgcl  has certain restrictions on a business combination and control share acquisition which we have opted out of 
if an affirmative majority of votes cast by a majority of stockholders entitled to vote approve it  our board of directors may opt in to such provisions of the mgcl 
if we opt in  and the stockholders approve it  these provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interests 
additionally  title  subtitle of the mgcl permits our board of directors  without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws  to take certain actions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium to the market price of our common stock or otherwise be in our stockholders best interests 
we have entered into an agreement with each of our senior executive officers that provides each of them benefits in the event his employment is terminated by us without cause  by him for good reason  or under certain circumstances following a change of control of our company 
we have entered into an agreement with each of our senior executive officers that provides each of them with severance benefits if his employment is terminated under certain circumstances following a change of control of our company 
certain of these benefits and the related tax indemnity could prevent or deter a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 
you have limited control as a stockholder regarding any changes we make to our policies 
our board of directors determines our major policies  including policies related to our investment objectives  leverage  financing  growth and distributions to our stockholders 
our board of directors may amend or revise these policies without a vote of our stockholders 
this means that our stockholders will have limited control over changes in our policies and those changes could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations to make distributions to our stockholders at expected levels  and we cannot assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future 
we intend to pay a quarterly dividend that represents at least of cash available for distribution 
our ability to make this intended distribution may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this annual report on form k and other reports that we file from time to time with the sec 
in addition  our board of directors has the sole discretion to determine the timing  form and amount of any distributions to our stockholders 
our board of directors will make determinations regarding distributions based upon many facts  including our financial performance  our debt service obligations  any debt covenants  our capital expenditure requirements  the requirements for qualification as a reit and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 
as a result  no assurance can be given that we will be able to make distributions to our stockholders at expected levels  or at all  or that distributions will increase or even be maintained over time  any of which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as with other publicly traded equity securities  the value of our common stock depends on various market conditions that may change from time to time 
among the market conditions that may affect the value of our common stock are the following the extent of investor interest in our securities  the general reputation of reits and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities  including securities issued by other real estate based companies  the underlying asset value of our hotels  
table of contents investor confidence in the stock and bond markets  generally  national and local economic conditions  changes in tax laws  our financial performance  and general stock and bond market conditions 
the market value of our common stock is based primarily upon the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions 
consequently  our common stock may trade at prices that are greater or less than our net asset value per share of common stock 
if our future earnings or cash distributions are less than expected  it is likely that the market price of our common stock will diminish 
further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current stockholders 
we may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock to raise the capital necessary to finance hotel acquisitions  refinance debt  or pay portions of future dividends 
in addition  we may issue preferred stock or units in our operating partnership  which are redeemable on a one to one basis for our common stock  to acquire hotels 
such issuances could result in dilution of stockholders equity 
future offerings of debt securities or preferred stock  which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation and for the purpose of distributions  may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in the future  we may increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or equity securities  which may include senior or subordinated notes  classes of preferred stock and or common stock 
we will be able to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without stockholder approval  unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which our securities may be listed or traded 
upon liquidation  holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock 
additional equity offerings could significantly dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock  or both 
holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution 
preferred stock and debt  if issued  could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend or interest payments that could limit our ability to make a distribution to the holders of our common stock 
because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings 
thus  our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest

we present the following two non gaap financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our operating performance earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  and amortization or ebitda  and funds from operations or ffo 
we caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of ebitda and ffo may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies  since not all companies calculate these non gaap measures in the same manner 
ebitda and ffo should not be considered as an alternative measure of our net income loss  operating performance  cash flow or liquidity 
ebitda and ffo may include funds that may not be available for our discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions and other commitments and uncertainties 
although we believe that ebitda and ffo can enhance your understanding of our results of operations  these non gaap financial measures  when viewed individually  are not necessarily better indicators of any trend as compared to gaap measures such as net income loss or cash flow from operations 
in addition  you should be aware that adverse economic and market conditions may harm our cash flow 
under this section  as required  we include a quantitative reconciliation of ebitda and ffo to the most directly comparable gaap financial performance measure  which is net income loss

table of contents corporate expenses for the year ended december  includes legal fees of approximately million related to the allerton bankruptcy proceedings and an accrual of million for the settlement of the los angeles airport marriott litigation 
corporate expenses for the year ended december  include charges of approximately million related to the retirement of our prior executive chairman and the termination of our prior executive vice president and general counsel 
we paid of the dividend in shares of common stock and the remainder in cash as permitted by the internal revenue service s revenue procedure all of our other dividends have been paid in cash 
ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  is net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of property and impairment write downs of depreciable operating property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures which are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity  thus our presentation of ffo may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reporting companies 
ffo is not intended to represent cash flows for the period 
ffo has not been presented as an alternative to operating income  but as an indicator of operating performance  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
ffo is a supplemental industry wide measure of reit operating performance  the definition of which was first proposed by nareit in and clarified in  and 
since the introduction of the definition by nareit  the term has come to be widely used by reits 
historical gaap cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical gaap cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
accordingly  we believe ffo combined with our primary gaap presentations help improve our stockholders ability to understand our operating performance 
we only use ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance 
the following is a reconciliation between net income loss and ffo in thousands year ended december  in thousands net loss income real estate related depreciation a gain on property disposal  net of tax ffo a amounts include depreciation expense included in discontinued operations as follows million in and  million in  million in  and million in ebitda is defined as net income loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we believe it is a useful financial performance measure for us and for our stockholders and is a complement to net income and other financial performance measures provided in accordance with gaap 
we use ebitda to measure the financial performance of our operating hotels because it excludes expenses such as depreciation and amortization  taxes and interest expense  which are not indicative of operating performance 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance irrespective of our capital structure or how we finance our properties and operations 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  which can vary from hotel to hotel based on a variety of factors unrelated to the hotels financial performance  we can more accurately assess the financial performance of our hotels 
under gaap  hotels are recorded at historical cost at the time of acquisition and are depreciated on a straight line basis 
by excluding depreciation and amortization  we believe ebitda provides a basis for measuring the financial performance of hotels unrelated to historical cost 
however  because ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization  it does not measure the capital we require to maintain or preserve our fixed assets 
in addition  because ebitda does not reflect interest expense  it does not take into account the total amount of interest we pay on outstanding debt nor does it show trends in interest costs due to changes in our borrowings or changes in interest rates 
ebitda  as calculated by us  may not be comparable to ebitda reported by other companies that do not define ebitda exactly as we define the term 
because we use ebitda to evaluate our financial performance  we reconcile it to net income loss which is the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity

overview diamondrock hospitality company is a lodging focused maryland corporation operating as a real estate investment trust reit 
we own a portfolio of premium hotels and resorts that contain  guest rooms 
we also hold the senior note on a mortgage loan secured by an additional hotel and have the right to acquire  upon completion  a hotel under development 
as an owner  rather than an operator  of lodging properties  we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by the hotels after the payment of fees due to hotel managers  which are calculated based on the revenues and profitability of each hotel 
our vision is to be the premier allocator of capital in the lodging industry 
our mission is to deliver long term stockholder returns through a combination of dividends and enduring capital appreciation 
our strategy is to utilize disciplined capital allocation and focus on the acquisition  ownership and asset management of high quality  branded lodging properties with superior growth prospects in north american markets with high barriers to entry 
we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by adhering to three basic principles in executing our strategy high quality urban and destination resort focused branded hotel real estate  innovative asset management  and conservative capital structure 
in addition  we are committed to enhancing the value of the company s platform by being open and transparent in our communications with stockholders  scrutinizing our corporate overhead and adopting and following sound corporate governance practices 
consistent with our strategy  we continue to direct our energies toward opportunistic investments in premium full service hotels and premium urban limited service hotels located throughout north america 
our portfolio is concentrated in key gateway cities and destination resorts located in popular vacation settings 
each of our hotels is managed by a third party and most are operated under a brand owned by one of the leading global lodging brand companies marriott international  inc marriott  starwood hotels resorts worldwide  inc starwood or hilton worldwide hilton 
high quality urban and destination resort focused branded hotel real estate we own premium hotels and resorts throughout north america 
our hotels and resorts are primarily categorized as upper upscale as defined by smith travel research and are generally located in high barrier to entry markets with multiple demand generators 
our properties are concentrated in four major gateway cities new york city  chicago 
los angeles and boston and in destination resort locations such as the us virgin islands and vail  colorado 
we consider lodging properties located in gateway cities and resort destinations to be most capable of creating dynamic cash flow growth and achieving superior long term capital appreciation 
we also believe that these locations are better insulated from new supply due to relatively high barriers to entry  including expensive construction costs and limited development sites 

table of contents we critically evaluate each potential acquisition to insure that the prospective asset is aligned with the vision we have set forth  supports our mission and corresponds with our strategy 
furthermore  we regularly analyze our portfolio to identify weaknesses therein and to strategize for the disposition of non key assets in order to recycle capital for additional acquisitions 
a core tenet of our strategy is to leverage the top global hotel brands 
we strongly believe that the largest global hotel brands create significant value as a result of each brand s ability to produce incremental revenue and that  as a result  branded hotels are able to generate greater profits than similar unbranded hotels 
the dominant global hotel brands typically have very strong reservation and reward systems and sales organizations  and most of our hotels are operated under a brand owned by one of the top global lodging brand companies marriott  starwood or hilton 
generally  we are interested in owning hotels that are currently operated under  or can be converted to  a globally recognized brand 
however  we would own or acquire non branded hotels in certain top tier or unique markets if we believe that the returns on these hotels would be higher than if the hotels were operated under a globally recognized brand 
innovative asset management we believe that we create significant value in our portfolio by utilizing our management team s extensive experience and encouraging innovative asset management strategies 
our senior management team has established a broad network of hotel industry contacts and relationships  including relationships with hotel owners  financiers  operators  project managers and contractors and other key industry participants 
we use our broad network of hotel industry contacts and relationships to maximize the value of our hotels 
under the federal income tax rules governing reits  we are required to engage a hotel manager that is an eligible independent contractor to manage each of our hotels pursuant to a management agreement with one of our subsidiaries 
our philosophy is to negotiate management agreements that give us the right to exert significant influence over the management of our properties  annual budgets and all capital expenditures all  to the extent permitted under the reit rules  and then to use those rights to continually monitor and improve the performance of our properties 
we cooperatively partner with our hotel managers in an attempt to increase operating results and long term asset values at our hotels 
in addition to working directly with the personnel at our hotels  our senior management team also has long standing professional relationships with our hotel managers senior executives  and we work directly with these senior executives to improve the performance of our portfolio 
we continue to explore strategic options to maximize the growth of revenue and profitability 
we persist in impressing upon our hotel managers the importance of limiting increases in property level operating expenses 
we maintain our practice of working closely with managers to optimize business at our hotels in order to maximize revenue and we remain committed to the objective of maintaining conservative corporate expenses 
we believe we can create significant value in our portfolio through innovative asset management strategies such as rebranding  renovating and repositioning and we engage in a process of regular evaluations of our portfolio in order to determine if there are opportunities to employ these value add strategies 
conservative capital structure since our formation in  we have been committed to a conservative capital structure with prudent leverage 
our outstanding debt as of december  consists of fixed interest rate mortgage debt with no significant maturities until late and outstanding borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility  which bears interest at an attractive floating rate 
we also maintain low financial leverage by often funding a portion of our acquisitions with proceeds from the issuance of equity 
we prefer that a significant portion of our portfolio remain unencumbered by debt in order to provide maximum balance sheet flexibility 
in addition  to the extent that we incur additional debt  our preference is limited recourse secured mortgage debt 
we expect that our strategy will enable us to maintain a balance sheet with an appropriate amount of debt throughout all phases of the lodging cycle 
we believe that it is not prudent to increase the inherent risk of highly cyclical lodging fundamentals through use of a highly leveraged capital structure 
we prefer a relatively simple but efficient capital structure 
we have not invested in joint ventures and have not issued any operating partnership units or preferred stock 
we endeavor to structure our hotel acquisitions so that they will not overly complicate our capital structure  however  we will consider a more complex transaction if we believe that the projected returns to our stockholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available 
at all times  we actively review and manage the sources and uses of our funds in order to mitigate our exposure to economic risks and to maximize returns for our investors 
in response to volatility in the financial markets during the last several years  we 
table of contents have undertaken additional measures in order to navigate the challenges created thereby and we are perpetually evaluating and updating these measures in order to effectively address evolving economic  social and political climates 
our ultimate goal in this regard is to create and maintain long term stockholder value 
key indicators of financial condition and operating performance we use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business 
these key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with us gaap  as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in addition  we use other information that may not be financial in nature  including statistical information and comparative data 
we use this information to measure the performance of individual hotels  groups of hotels and or our business as a whole 
we periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry wide information 
these key indicators include occupancy percentage  average daily rate or adr  revenue per available room or revpar  earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization or ebitda  and funds from operations or ffo 
occupancy  adr and revpar are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance 
revpar  which is calculated as the product of adr and occupancy percentage  is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our business as a whole 
we evaluate individual hotel revpar performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods  as well as on a company wide and regional basis 
adr and revpar include only room revenue 
room revenue comprised approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  and is dictated by demand  as measured by occupancy percentage  pricing  as measured by adr  and our available supply of hotel rooms 
our adr  occupancy percentage and revpar performance may be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as us economic conditions generally  regional and local employment growth  personal income and corporate earnings  office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions  airport and other business and leisure travel  new hotel construction and the pricing strategies of competitors 
in addition  our adr  occupancy percentage and revpar performance is dependent on the continued success of our hotels global brands 
we also use ebitda and ffo as measures of the financial performance of our business

on april   we closed on a million loan secured by a mortgage on the hilton minneapolis

the transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  including the receipt of lender consents 
rebranding of the radisson lexington 
in connection with our acquisition of the radisson lexington hotel new york  we assumed the existing franchise agreement with radisson which provides for termination options that may be exercised during two day windows  the first of which begins on march   upon payment of a  termination fee 
it is our intention to exercise the termination right and to enter into a franchise agreement with marriott to license the hotel as a member of its autograph collection 
we have entered into a non binding term sheet with marriott to affiliate the hotel with the autograph collection  however  there can be no assurance that marriott will enter into a franchise agreement and agree to license the hotel 
specifically  the re branding of the hotel as the lexington and the affiliation of the hotel with marriott s autograph collection will involve the completion of a million capital plan to renovate  reposition and significantly upgrade the hotel

the closing of the loan is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  including final loan syndication 
outlook for we believe that the lodging industry appears to be in the early stages of a long and sustainable recovery 
industry data suggests that the lodging industry has commenced a multi year period of historically low additions to hotel supply 
with the low supply backdrop  we anticipate that the increase in travel demand will translate into significant revenue and profit growth for existing hotel owners 
moreover  we believe that we are in an excellent hotel acquisition environment  as we are evaluating an increasing number of high quality assets being marketed for purchase 
we believe that our flexible and conservative capital structure ensures that we are prepared to capitalize on opportunities that may arise that we believe are in the best interests of our company and our stockholders in this advantageous environment

rooms revenue from contract and other business increased from rooms revenue from the business transient segment  traditionally the most profitable segment for hotels  increased from the prior year 
group rooms revenue increased from the prior year due primarily to an increase in group adr as the group room nights were flat to the prior year 
food and beverage revenues increased million from the comparable period in due primarily to a million increase in revenues from our and acquisitions  which was offset by a decrease of million at our comparable hotels

our corporate expenses increased million  from million for the year december  to million for the year ended december  corporate expenses principally consist of employee related costs  including base payroll  bonus and restricted stock

we incurred million of hotel acquisition costs during the year ended december  associated with the acquisitions of the times square development hotel  jw marriott denver at cherry creek  radisson lexington  and courtyard denver downtown

interest expense 
our interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to interest expense on our mortgage financing on the hilton minneapolis  the mortgage loans assumed in conjunction with our acquisitions of the jw marriott denver and courtyard denver downtown  and the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility in the interest expense for the year ended december  was comprised of mortgage debt million  amortization of deferred financing costs and debt premiums million  interest and unused fees on our credit facility million  which were partially offset by capitalized interest of million

the remaining increase of million at our comparable hotels was due to a percentage point increase in occupancy and percent increase in adr 
food and beverage revenues increased million from the comparable period in  which is partially due to million of revenues from our acquisitions 
the remaining increase of million at our comparable hotels is driven by higher outlet revenue and  to a lesser extent  higher banquet revenue 
other revenues  which primarily represent spa  golf  parking and attrition and cancellation fees  decreased million from the comparable period in  which is primarily the result of lower attrition and cancellation fees for the year ended december  as is typical during the initial stages of a lodging recovery

food and beverage expenses decreased at our comparable hotels primarily as a result of our efforts to increase profitability at our hotel restaurants and outlets 
other fixed charges increased primarily as a result of million of hurricane damage sustained at frenchman s reef from hurricane earl in late august property taxes decreased as a result of a number of successful multi year real estate tax appeals as well as lower real estate tax assessments at certain hotels 
base management fees are calculated as a percentage of total revenues and incentive management fees are based on the level of operating profit at certain hotels 
therefore  the increase in base management fees is due to the overall increase in revenues at our hotels 
the increase in incentive management fees from the comparable period in is due to the increased profit at certain of our hotels and a higher number of hotels earning an incentive management fee in as compared to depreciation and amortization 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  due primarily to our acquisitions 
corporate expenses 
our corporate expenses decreased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  corporate expenses principally consist of employee related costs  including base payroll  bonus and restricted stock 
corporate expenses also include corporate operating costs  professional fees and directors fees 
the decrease in corporate expenses is due primarily to charges of million in due to the retirement of our prior executive chairman  william w 
mccarten  and the termination of our prior executive vice president and general counsel  michael d 
schecter  partially offset by higher legal and professional fees in hotel acquisition costs 
we incurred million of hotel acquisition costs during the year ended december  associated with the acquisitions of the hilton minneapolis  renaissance charleston  and hilton garden inn chelsea  as well as the entry into the agreement to acquire the hotel now under development in new york city 
we had no acquisitions during the year ended december  interest expense

the interest expense for the year ended december  was comprised of mortgage debt million  amortization of deferred financing costs million and interest and unused facility fees on our credit facility million 
in  we recorded million of default interest as a result of the event of default on the frenchman s reef mortgage  which we reversed in the first quarter of all of our mortgage debt during and was fixed rate secured debt bearing interest at rates ranging from percent to percent per year 
interest income 
interest income increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to our corporate cash balances being slightly higher in  as well as the interest rates earned on corporate cash having increased slightly since discontinued operations 
income loss from discontinued operations represents the three hotel portfolio classified as held for sale

the income tax benefit was recorded on the pre tax loss of our trs for the year ended december   offset by a foreign income tax expense of million related to the taxable reit subsidiary that owns frenchman s reef 
liquidity and capital resources our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to fund distributions to our stockholders to maintain our reit status as well as to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our hotels  including capital expenditures  funding of the renovation escrow account  and scheduled debt payments of interest and principal 
we currently expect that our available cash flows  which are generally provided through net cash provided by hotel operations  existing cash balances and  if necessary  short term borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
some of our mortgage debt agreements contain cash trap provisions that are triggered when the hotel s operating results fall below a certain debt service coverage ratio 
when these provisions are triggered  all of the excess cash flow generated by the hotel is deposited directly into cash management accounts for the benefit of our lenders until a specified debt service coverage ratio is reached and maintained for a certain period of time 
such provisions do not allow the lender the right to accelerate repayment of the underlying debt 
our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional hotels  renovations  expansions and other capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our hotels  scheduled debt payments and making distributions to our stockholders 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including cash provided by operations  borrowings  issuances of additional equity or debt securities and proceeds from property dispositions 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including the state of the credit markets  our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders 
our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity and or debt securities is also dependent on a number of factors including the current state of the capital markets  investor sentiment and intended use of proceeds 
we may need to raise additional capital if we identify acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives 
our financing strategy since our formation in  we have been committed to a conservative capital structure with prudent leverage 
other than borrowings under our million senior unsecured credit facility  our outstanding debt is fixed interest rate mortgage debt with limited near term maturities 
we have a preference to maintain a significant portion of our portfolio as unencumbered assets in order to provide balance sheet flexibility 
in addition  to the extent that we incur additional debt  our preference is limited recourse secured mortgage debt 
this strategy enables us to maintain a balance sheet with a prudent amount of debt 
we believe that it is not prudent to increase the inherent risk of a highly cyclical business by maintaining a highly leveraged capital structure 
we prefer a relatively simple but efficient capital structure 
we have not invested in joint ventures and have not issued any operating partnership units or preferred stock 
we endeavor to structure our hotel acquisitions so that they will not overly complicate our capital structure  however  we will consider a more complex transaction if we believe that the projected returns to our stockholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available 

table of contents we believe that we maintain a reasonable amount of debt 
on april   we closed on a new million loan secured by a mortgage on the hilton minneapolis 
on may   in connection with our acquisition of the jw marriott denver at cherry creek  we assumed a million mortgage loan secured by the hotel 
on july   in connection with our acquisition of the courtyard denver downtown  we assumed a million loan secured by a mortgage on the hotel  which was repaid on february  as of december   we had billion of debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of and a weighted average maturity date of approximately years 
short term borrowings other than borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility  we do not utilize short term borrowings to meet liquidity requirements 
during the year ended december   we borrowed million under our senior unsecured credit facility to partially fund the acquisitions of the radisson lexington hotel new york and courtyard denver downtown 
as of december   we had million outstanding on the credit facility 
senior unsecured credit facility on june   we amended and restated our million unsecured credit facility  which now expires in august the maturity date of the facility may be extended for an additional year upon the payment of applicable fees and the satisfaction of certain other customary conditions 
we also have the right to increase the amount of the facility up to million with lender approval 
interest is paid on the periodic advances under the facility at varying rates  based upon libor  plus an agreed upon additional margin amount 
the applicable margin is based upon the company s ratio of net indebtedness to ebitda  as follows ratio of net indebtedness to ebitda applicable margin less than to greater than or equal to to but less than to greater than or equal to to but less than to greater than or equal to to but less than to greater than or equal to to in addition to the interest payable on amounts outstanding under the facility  we are required to pay an amount equal to of the unused portion of the facility if the unused portion of the facility is greater than or if the unused portion of the facility is less than or equal to 
the facility contains various corporate financial covenants 
a summary of the most restrictive covenants is as follows actual at covenant december  maximum leverage ratio minimum fixed charge coverage ratio x x minimum tangible net worth billion billion leverage ratio is total indebtedness  as defined in the credit agreement and which includes our commitment on the times square development hotel  divided by total asset value  which is defined in the credit agreement as a total cash and cash equivalents plus b the value of our owned hotels based on i until march   appraised values and ii after march   hotel net operating income divided by an capitalization rate  and c the book value of the allerton loan 
fixed charge coverage ratio is adjusted ebitda  which is defined in the credit agreement as ebitda less ff e reserves  for the most recently ending fiscal months  to fixed charges  which is defined in the credit agreement as interest expense  all regularly scheduled principal payments and payments on capitalized lease obligations  for the same most recently ending fiscal month period 
tangible net worth  as defined in the credit agreement  is i total gross book value of all assets  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  less intangible assets  total indebtedness  and all other liabilities  plus ii of net proceeds from future equity issuances 
the facility requires us to maintain a specific pool of unencumbered borrowing base properties 
the unencumbered borrowing base assets are subject  among other restrictions  to the following limitations and covenants a minimum of five properties with an unencumbered borrowing base value  as defined in the credit agreement  of not less than million 

table of contents the unencumbered borrowing base must include the westin boston waterfront  the conrad chicago and the vail marriott mountain resort and spa 
the conrad chicago and the vail marriott mountain resort and spa may be released from the unencumbered borrowing base upon lender approval and the satisfaction of certain conditions 
in connection with the closing of the hilton minneapolis mortgage loan in april  we received lender approval to release the company s subsidiaries owning the hilton minneapolis as guarantors under the facility 
as of december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under the facility and the company s ratio of net indebtedness to ebitda was x 
accordingly  interest on our borrowings under the facility will continue to be based on libor plus basis points for the next fiscal quarter 
we incurred interest and unused credit facility fees on the facility of million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
subsequent to december   we have borrowed an additional million under the facility 
in conjunction with our acquisition of the radisson lexington hotel new york  the seller s million mortgage secured by the hotel was assigned to us and we added the mortgage as security to the facility 
sources and uses of cash our principal sources of cash are net cash flow from hotel operations  borrowings under mortgage debt and our credit facility and the proceeds from our equity offerings 
our principal uses of cash are acquisitions of hotel properties and notes  debt service  capital expenditures  operating costs  corporate expenses and dividends 
as of december   we had million of unrestricted corporate cash and million of restricted cash 
our net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  our cash from operations generally consists of the net cash flow from hotel operations which is offset by cash paid for corporate expenses  cash paid for interest  funding of lender escrow reserves and other working capital changes 
our net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of the acquisitions of the jw marriott denver  radisson lexington  and courtyard denver downtown million  collectively and the deposit on the hotel under development in times square million  which is partially offset by the receipt of key money million with respect to frenchman s reef and conrad chicago as well as million of default interest payments on our note receivable 
in addition  we made certain capital expenditures at frenchman s reef and our other hotels and funded restricted cash reserves for capital expenditures 
our net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of million of proceeds from our follow on equity offering  million of proceeds from our hilton minneapolis mortgage loan and million of net draws on our credit facility  which was partially offset by million of dividend payments  million paid for financing costs and million paid to repurchase shares upon the vesting of restricted stock for the payment of tax withholding obligations  as well as million of scheduled mortgage debt principal payments 
dividend policy we intend to distribute to our stockholders dividends at least equal to our reit taxable income so as to avoid paying corporate income tax and excise tax on our earnings other than the earnings of our trs and trs lessees  which are all subject to tax at regular corporate rates and to qualify for the tax benefits afforded to reits under the code 
in order to qualify as a reit under the code  we generally must make distributions to our stockholders each year in an amount equal to at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains  plus of the excess of our net income from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by the code  minus any excess non cash income 
the timing and frequency of distributions will be authorized by our board of directors and declared by us based upon a variety of factors  including our financial performance  restrictions under applicable law and our current and future loan agreements  our debt service requirements  our capital expenditure requirements  the requirements for qualification as a reit under the code and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 

table of contents the following table sets forth the dividends on common shares for the years ended december   and payment date record date dividend per share january  december  april  march  june  june  september  september  january  december  capital expenditures the management and franchise agreements for each of our hotels provide for the establishment of separate property improvement funds to cover  among other things  the cost of replacing and repairing furniture and fixtures at our hotels 
contributions to the property improvement fund are calculated as a percentage of hotel revenues 
in addition  we may be required to pay for the cost of certain additional improvements that are not permitted to be funded from the property improvement fund under the applicable management or franchise agreement 
as of december   we have set aside million for capital projects in property improvement funds  which are included in restricted cash 
funds held in property improvement funds for one hotel are typically not permitted to be applied to any other property 
during  we spent approximately million of capital improvements 
of that amount  approximately million was funded from corporate cash and the balance from reserves held by our hotel managers and a million contribution from marriott towards the capital investment program at frenchman s reef 
we have substantially completed the work scheduled for in our comprehensive million capital investment program at frenchman s reef 
the majority of the renovation and repositioning program commenced in early may when two of the resort s four buildings representing approximately guestrooms closed

non gaap financial measures 
table of contents we use the following two non gaap financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our operating performance ebitda and ffo 
these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with gaap 
refer to item selected financial data in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding our use of non gaap financial measures 
ebitda represents net loss income excluding interest expense  provision for income taxes  including income taxes applicable to sale of assets  and depreciation and amortization 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and our asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
in addition  covenants included in our indebtedness use ebitda as a measure of financial compliance 
we also use ebitda as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions 
year ended december  in thousands net loss interest expense income tax expense benefit real estate related depreciation ebitda amounts include interest expense included in discontinued operations as follows million in and and million in amounts include income tax expense benefit included in discontinued operations as follows million in  in and million in amounts include depreciation expense included in discontinued operations as follows million in and and million in we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts  which defines ffo as net loss income determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of property and impairment write downs of depreciable operating property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures which are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we believe that the presentation of ffo provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it is a measure of our operations without regard to specified non cash items  such as real estate depreciation and amortization and gain or loss on sale of assets 
we also use ffo as one measure in assessing our results 
year ended december  in thousands net loss real estate related depreciation ffo amounts include depreciation expense included in discontinued operations as follows million in and and million in critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the diamondrock hospitality company and all consolidated subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant 
table of contents accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates investment in hotels 
acquired hotels  land improvements  building and furniture  fixtures and equipment and identifiable intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value 
additions to property and equipment  including current buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost 
property and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for buildings and land improvements and one to ten years for furniture and equipment 
identifiable intangible assets are typically related to contracts  including ground lease agreements and hotel management agreements  which are recorded at fair value 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair market contract rates for corresponding contracts 
contracts acquired that are at market do not have significant value 
we typically enter into a new hotel management agreement based on market terms at the time of acquisition 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data 
management also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we review our investments in hotels for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments in hotels may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may cause us to perform a review include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in the demand for lodging at our properties due to declining national or local economic conditions  new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located and or decisions to sell any of our properties 
when such conditions exist  management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of an investment in a hotel exceed the hotel s carrying value 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss recognized 
while our hotels have experienced improvement in certain key operating measures as the general economic conditions improve  the operating performance at certain of our hotels has not achieved our expected levels 
as part of our overall capital allocation strategy  we assess underperforming hotels for possible disposition  which could result in a reduction in the hotel s carrying amount to its estimated fair value 
revenue recognition 
hotel revenues  including room  golf  food and beverage  and other hotel revenues  are recognized as the related services are provided 
additionally  our operators collect sales  use  occupancy and similar taxes at our hotels which are excluded from revenue in our consolidated statements of operations revenue is recorded net of such taxes 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based employee compensation using the fair value based method of accounting 
we record the cost of awards with service conditions and market conditions based on the grant date fair value of the award 
for awards based on market conditions  the grant date fair value is derived using an open form valuation model 
the cost of the award is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted 
we have elected to be treated as a reit under the provisions of the internal revenue code and  as such  are not subject to federal income tax  provided we distribute all of our taxable income annually to our stockholders and comply with certain other requirements 
in addition to paying federal and state income tax on any retained income  we are subject to taxes on built in gains on sales of certain assets 
additionally  our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and foreign income tax 
notes receivable 
we initially record acquired notes receivable at cost 
notes receivable are evaluated for collectability and if collectability of the original amounts due is in doubt  the value is adjusted for impairment 
if collectability is in doubt  the note is placed in non accrual status 
no interest is recorded on such notes until the timing and amounts of cash receipts can be reasonably estimated 
we record cash payments received on non accrual notes receivable as a reduction in basis we continually assess the current facts and circumstances to determine whether we can reasonably estimate cash flows 
if we can reasonably estimate the timing and amount of cash flows to be collected  then income recognition becomes possible 

table of contents inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
however  competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates 
seasonality the operations of hotels historically have been seasonal depending on location  and accordingly  we expect some seasonality in our business 
historically  we have experienced approximately two thirds of our annual income in the second and fourth fiscal quarters 
new accounting pronouncements not yet implemented there are no new unimplemented accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
in pursuing our business strategies  the primary market risk to which we are currently exposed  and  to which we expect to be exposed in the future  is interest rate risk 
the face amount of our outstanding debt as of december  was billion  of which million was variable rate 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt fluctuate by  interest expense would increase or decrease  depending on rate movement  future earnings and cash flows  by million annually
