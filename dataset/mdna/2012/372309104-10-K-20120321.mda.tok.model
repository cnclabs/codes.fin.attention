our xt system received k clearance from the food and drug administration  or fda  and is designed to support a broad range of molecular diagnostic tests with a compact and easy to use workstation and self contained  disposable test cartridges 
within minutes of receipt of an extracted and amplified nucleic acid sample  our xt system produces clear and accurate results 
our xt system supports up to independent test cartridges  of which each can be run independently  resulting in a highly convenient and flexible workflow for our target customers  which are hospitals and reference laboratories 
as of december   we had an installed base of analyzers  or placements  with our customers 

table of contents our products we have developed four diagnostic tests for use with our xt system and expect to expand this test menu by introducing two to four new tests annually 
our cystic fibrosis genotyping test  which detects pre conception risks of cystic fibrosis  our warfarin sensitivity test  which determines an individual s ability to metabolize the oral anticoagulant warfarin  and our thrombophilia risk test  which detects an individual s increased risk of blood clots  have received fda clearance 
our esensor technology has demonstrated accuracy in clinical studies in our cystic fibrosis genotyping test  our warfarin sensitivity test and our thrombophilia risk test as compared to dna sequencing 
we have also developed a respiratory viral panel test  currently available for research use only  that has been submitted to the fda for k clearance 
we also have a pipeline of several additional potential products in different stages of development or design  including diagnostic tests for genotyping the hepatitis c virus  and for mutations in a gene known as kras  which is predictive of an individual s response rates to certain prescribed anti cancer therapies 
we are also developing our next generation platform  the nexgen system 
we are designing the nexgen system formerly referred to as the ad system to integrate automated nucleic acid extraction and amplification with our esensor detection technology to enable technicians to place a patient sample into our test cartridge and obtain results without any additional steps 
this sample to answer capability is enabled by the robust nature of our esensor detection technology  which is not impaired by sample impurities that we believe hinder competing technologies 
we are designing our nexgen system to further simplify workflow and provide powerful  cost effective molecular diagnostics solutions to a significantly expanded group of hospitals and reference laboratories 
our xt system and planned menu of tests are intended to improve patient care and physician practices by providing high value  clinically useful information that aids in the diagnosis of disease and the selection of treatments tailored to an individual s genetic profile 
we believe that these improvements in patient care are economically attractive to our customers who are generally reimbursed for these tests by third party payors and managed care providers through established reimbursement codes 
given historically positive reimbursement levels and because the xt system is designed to be flexible and easy to use  we believe that our customers will choose to perform a broad range of tests on our platform  in some cases providing our customers with sources of diagnostic test revenue previously unavailable to them 
by focusing our product development and commercialization efforts on high value  clinically useful opportunities in genetic and infectious diseases  cancer and personalized medicine  we believe we will drive widespread clinical adoption of our products 
our strategy our goal is to become the market leading provider of automated  multiplex molecular diagnostic testing systems 
we intend to expand the use of our xt system and diagnostic tests targeting especially those reference laboratories and hospitals in the united states which perform a high volume of molecular diagnostic tests 
to achieve this objective  we intend to expand our menu of clinical diagnostic products 
we intend to develop a broad menu of molecular diagnostic tests that we believe satisfy important medical needs and 
table of contents will be attractively reimbursed by third party payors 
we are pursuing and intend to continue to pursue fda clearance or approval for our tests 
we intend to explore tests that are either already in high demand or projected to experience rapid growth 
we plan to gain access to these tests by in licensing  where required  the appropriate biomarkers that have shown correlations to diseases or therapeutic response 
grow our installed base of customers 
we have identified those laboratories and hospitals in the united states that we believe will be high volume customers and who will benefit from our esensor technology

increase utilization of tests 
we intend to increase the use of our diagnostic tests by developing and offering tools and support tailored to our products such as accredited physician education programs and seminars  product training for our customers and reimbursement support 
these activities will aid in establishing the clinical utility of multiplex molecular diagnostic tests  which we believe will increase adoption of our products 
develop our nexgen system 
we are developing our nexgen system to provide a complete sample to answer solution for our customers 
the nexgen system will retain all the customer benefits of our xt system while also integrating automated nucleic acid extraction and amplification 
these features will eliminate the need for time consuming and complex sample preparation steps and allow technicians to place a patient sample into our test cartridge 
we have already demonstrated feasibility of direct sample to answer on a nexgen system prototype using diluted blood 
we believe this advancement will make our technology attractive to a broader range of hospitals and laboratories that lack the technical or economic resources to perform molecular diagnostic testing with existing products and technology 
we believe such workflow enhancements may expand our target user base from some  customers to over  potential customers in the united states 
expand internationally and explore out licensing opportunities 
we plan to offer our molecular diagnostic products in european and other international markets in the future 
we anticipate using marketing partners and distributors as we expand internationally 
we expect to supplement marketing partnerships with specialists who will train our partners sales forces and provide technical support 
we also intend to explore opportunities to leverage our intellectual property position in detection technologies through licensing or the establishment of partnerships 
revenues from external customers  net loss and total assets for the past three years are contained in our consolidated financial statements in part ii of this report 
our products our xt system our xt system is an automated molecular diagnostic system that enables reference laboratories and hospitals to perform fast  accurate and easy to use molecular diagnostic tests 
the xt system  which employs our proprietary electrochemical detection technology  consists of a compact bench top workstation with an integrated touch screen computer and an analyzer into which the self contained  disposable test cartridges are inserted 
the xt system is user friendly  
table of contents intuitive  requires minimal maintenance and provides laboratories with the ability to perform multiplex molecular diagnostic tests in an efficient and cost effective manner 
with a footprint of approximately by inches in its standard configuration  the xt system takes up less bench top space than most of our competitors systems  and its standalone design allows it to be installed and used without any required laboratory modifications 
specifically  we believe that our xt system and related diagnostic tests will offer reference laboratories and hospitals the following benefits versatile platform for a broad menu 
our xt system has broad application across a number of areas in molecular diagnostic testing 
in addition to our fda cleared cystic fibrosis genotyping test  warfarin sensitivity test and thrombophilia risk test  and our respiratory viral panel test  which is labeled for ruo and has been submitted to the fda  we have a pipeline of several additional products in development or design in the fields of pharmacogenetics  genetic diseases  infectious diseases and cancer 
we are currently developing a plavix sensitivity test  hepatitis c virus genotyping test and a kras mutation test  and we have a pipeline of potential products in various stages of development or design 
laboratories using our system will be able to run the additional tests we offer without any additional capital investment or operator training 
fda cleared products 
we have received fda clearance for our cystic fibrosis genotyping test  warfarin sensitivity test and thrombophilia risk test 
we submitted our respiratory viral panel test to the fda for k clearance in the fourth quarter of we intend to utilize iuo labeled products in clinical studies within the broader process of seeking fda clearance for our diagnostic tests 
ease of use 
our xt system eliminates the need to use complex instrumentation to generate test results 
our xt system minimizes manual processing steps and streamlines data analysis  making molecular diagnostic testing available to a broad spectrum of laboratories without the need for highly skilled technicians 
as a result  our xt system can provide national reference laboratories with the ability to perform our menu of molecular diagnostic tests across all of their locations 
we also designed our xt system to require minimal maintenance 
accuracy and reliability 
our xt system provides accurate and reliable molecular diagnostic test results 
we have demonstrated accuracy in clinical studies compared to dna sequencing in our cystic fibrosis genotyping test  our warfarin sensitivity test and our thrombophilia risk test 
our xt system limits technician contact with a patient sample  thereby reducing contamination risk 
it also provides clear reports  minimizing the risk of human error and increasing the repeatability of test results 
enhanced laboratory work flow 
our unique platform allows for random access  or the ability to initiate tests while other tests are in progress  resulting in a highly convenient and flexible workflow 
our xt system provides random access for up to independent test cartridges 
in addition  our proprietary electrochemical detection technology streamlines the sample preparation process and eliminates the need for the additional washing steps required by some other detection methods  such as optical or fluorescent detection 
laboratories using our xt system can expect to obtain test 
table of contents results within minutes of receipt of the amplified dna sample  resulting in a total turnaround time of generally under four hours 
multiplex capability 
our xt system can detect up to separate biomarkers in a single test cartridge 
this allows laboratories to run multiple tests or panels on an individual patient sample in a one step detection process 
this capability reduces the time required for a laboratory to perform a diagnostic analysis that involves multiple genetic markers or infectious disease pathogens  which otherwise would require the laboratory to run multiple  separate molecular diagnostic tests 
prior to performing a test  a laboratory technician takes isolated dna from the patient sample and performs an automated nucleic acid extraction and amplification step with materials supplied with our test cartridge 
in some cases  the technician also performs a routine enzymatic treatment before adding our proprietary signal probes and transferring the solution into the sample compartment in our test cartridge 
the technician enters sample identification and reagent information into our xt system using the supplied bar code wand or on screen keyboard and inserts the test cartridge into an open slot on the analyzer 
the on board computer automatically assimilates input information and test cartridge information from the memory chip on the test cartridge and initiates the specified test protocol 
the testing process takes under four hours to complete  and the test results can be viewed on the built in touch screen monitor minutes after the insertion of test cartridges into the xt test results can also be printed out or reported through the laboratory s computer information system 
the key features of our xt system include key features characteristics fast turnaround minutes to result from amplified dna sample with minimal technician time needed accurate results our cystic fibrosis genotyping test  our warfarin sensitivity test and our thrombophilia risk test demonstrated accuracy in clinical studies compared to dna sequencing ease of use intuitive touch screen interface and clear reports small footprint approximately inches in width and depth in its standard configuration random access each of up to test cartridge slots can be accessed independently minimal maintenance no routine maintenance or calibration required multiplex capability detects up to distinct biomarkers in a single sample our test menu we have developed six diagnostic tests for use with our xt system  three of which have received clearance from the fda and one of which has been submitted to the fda for k clearance 
during the fiscal year ended december   sales of our cystic fibrosis genotyping test represented approximately of our revenues  and sales of our thrombophilia risk test represented approximately of our revenues 
cystic fibrosis genotyping 
our cystic fibrosis genotyping test is a multiplex genotyping test that detects a panel of mutations associated with cystic fibrosis based on guidelines published 
table of contents by the american college of medical genetics and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists for screening of adult couples contemplating pregnancy 
our cystic fibrosis genotyping test demonstrated accuracy in clinical studies as compared to dna sequencing and delivers results within minutes of receipt of the amplified dna sample 
test results are summarized in an easy to interpret report that includes a summary carrier or non carrier determination as well as individual carrier status for each of the recommended markers 
our cystic fibrosis genotyping test received fda clearance in july our cystic fibrosis genotyping test addresses a market that was estimated in at over million in the united states alone 
more than million americans are carriers of one mutation of the cystic fibrosis gene 
the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists suggests that all couples who are considering having a child  or those who are expecting a child  should have genetic carrier testing for cystic fibrosis 
much of current cystic fibrosis testing is performed by national reference laboratories 
with the availability of highly accurate  easy to use cystic fibrosis tests  we expect that the market will continue to decentralize through regional reference laboratories and hospitals now capable of offering this test 
warfarin sensitivity 
our warfarin sensitivity test is a multiplex pharmacogenetic test for the detection of three genetic markers that are known to play a critical role in metabolism of  and sensitivity to  warfarin 
warfarin  offered under the brand name coumadin  is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant in north america and europe and is used to prevent heart attacks  strokes  and blood clots in veins  arteries and lungs 
through detection of an individual s sensitivity to warfarin  doctors are better able to accurately and efficiently determine the appropriate warfarin dosage level on an individual patient basis 
our warfarin sensitivity test demonstrated accuracy in clinical studies compared to dna sequencing and delivers results within minutes of receipt of the amplified dna sample 
our warfarin sensitivity test received fda clearance in july thrombophilia risk 
thrombophilia is a condition where a person s blood clots easily or excessively placing them at risk of developing clots 
thrombophilia is a particular concern for high risk patients  including patients who are pregnant or undergoing certain surgeries 
our thrombophilia risk test is a multiplex test for the detection of four common inherited genetic risk factors of thrombophilia factor v leiden  factor ii prothrombin and two genetic markers in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mthfr gene 
our thrombophilia risk test demonstrated accuracy in clinical studies compared to dna sequencing and delivers results within minutes of receipt of the amplified dna sample 
our thrombophilia risk test received fda clearance in april thrombophilia is one of the most common types of blood coagulation disorders affecting in  individuals 
we believe the us market is approximately million based on statistics provided by kalorama information  a market research firm 
respiratory viral panel rvp 
our respiratory viral panel test  currently labeled for ruo  covers approximately viruses  including influenza a hn and seasonal  influenza b  respiratory syncytial virus  or rsv  and numerous other upper respiratory viruses 
we submitted it for fda clearance in the fourth quarter of we expect to obtain fda clearance on our respiratory viral panel test in 
table of contents respiratory pathogens are a major source of illness and can lead to hospitalizations and death 
according to the centers for disease control  each year in the united states on average  to of the population gets the flu  more than  people are hospitalized from flu related complications  and about  people die from flu related causes 
rsv is the most common cause of bronchitis and pneumonia in infants and young children  with up to  children hospitalized annually in the united states 
the challenge to the physician assessing a patient with a respiratory illness is determining the underlying cause so that an effective treatment plan can be determined 
c genotyping test c 
our c genotyping test  currently labeled for ruo  is a multiplex test for the detection and genotyping of the          and alleles of the cytochrome p cyp c gene locus 
c is a member of the cytochrome p mixed function oxidase system and is involved in the metabolism of several important groups of drugs including many proton pump inhibitors and anticonvulsants 
hepatitis c virus genotyping hcvg 
our hcv genotyping test  currently labeled for ruo  is a multiplex test for the detection and typing subtyping of hcv a  b  a c  b     a b 
according to the centers for disease control  hepatitis c virus hcv infection is the most common chronic blood borne infection in the united states with over million persons considered chronically infected 
according to the world health organization  it is estimated that some million people are chronically infected with hcv globally and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and or liver cancer  and more than  people die from hcv related liver diseases each year 
an article recently published in the annals of internal medicine found that  in the us  hcv is cited as the cause of death more than hiv 
based on the current treatment guidelines for hcv  a patient s genotype is a component of selecting the proper treatment strategy as well as a predictor of the likelihood of treatment success 
our tests in development and design we have a pipeline of potential products in various stages of development or design 
we consider our diagnostic tests to be in the design phase once they have advanced beyond the conceptual stage 
we perform market research  clinical publication reviews  customer interviews  technical feasibility and freedom to operate assessments to determine if a potential diagnostics test is a viable product candidate 
we believe that all of our tests in the design stage have viable market potential and are technically feasible to develop using our esensor technology 
while we do not currently license biomarkers for all products in the design phase  we believe we will be able to obtain such licenses  if needed  on commercially reasonable terms 
we intend to introduce two to four new tests annually 
we select these tests based upon what we believe are clinically relevant products which address unmet market needs 
laboratories using our xt system will be able to run the additional tests we offer without any additional capital investment or operator training 
we are currently developing or designing the following diagnostic tests infectious disease test panels 
the infectious disease diagnostics market is estimated to reach over billion in the united states by  with substantial growth expected in the 
table of contents molecular diagnostic segment 
we are currently designing other infectious disease test panels that would align strategically with our existing respiratory viral panel test offering by leveraging our current and future xt system placements in the acute care setting 
the test panels we are designing fit into two categories genotyping tests for viruses such as hepatitis c virus hcv and human papillomavirus hpv or detection tests for panels of viruses  bacteria or fungi such as central nervous system infections or lower respiratory tract infections 
genotyping tests are run throughout the year whereas many detection tests have a seasonal component 
in order to maximize the value of systems installed for infectious disease tests like our rvp product  we intend to develop a broad range of detection assays which have distinctly different seasonal peaks in prevalence to allow our customers to utilize our system for infectious disease testing throughout the year 
currently  several infectious disease panels and genotyping tests are in the design concept stage 
these include bacterial respiratory tract infections  central nervous system infections cns  and gastrointestinal pathogens 
kras mutation 
anti egfr therapy is a type of cancer treatment that interferes with the growth of cancer cells  slowing their growth and subsequent spread in the body 
anti egfr therapy is currently approved by the fda to treat colorectal cancer as well as head and neck cancer 
scientific studies have demonstrated that patients whose tumors have genetic variations in the kras gene will not respond to anti egfr therapy 
currently approved anti egfr therapies are marketed under the brand names erbitux and vectibix 
these therapies are approved for use in colorectal cancer and more recently head and neck cancer in the case of erbitux 
according to the american cancer society s website  there are over one million new cases of colorectal cancer globally each year with approximately  cases in the united states alone 
we are currently developing a multiplex kras test that detects a panel of common genetic markers in the kras gene 
the fda requires kras testing on the labels of the two approved anti egfr antibody therapeutics  vectibix and erbitux  for use in colorectal cancer 
oncology and personalized medicine tests 
given the trend in oncology towards tailoring treatment to an individual s tumor type and the emerging interest in personalized medicine  we are currently researching and evaluating the development of test panels in these areas 
expanding our product offering into these two areas would align strategically with our existing products as well as development stage products by leveraging our current and future xt system placements in these laboratories 
our nexgen system we are developing our nexgen system to provide a complete sample to answer solution for our customers 
the nexgen system will retain all the customer benefits of our xt system while also integrating automated nucleic acid extraction and amplification 
these features will eliminate the need for time consuming and complex sample preparation steps and allow technicians to place a patient sample into our test cartridge 
we have already demonstrated feasibility of direct sample to answer on a nexgen system prototype using whole blood 
we believe this advancement will make our esensor technology attractive to the broad range of institutions that currently lack the technical or economic resources to perform molecular diagnostic testing 
we believe the nexgen system may expand our target user base from  to over  potential laboratories and hospitals in the united states 

table of contents we believe our approach to a sample to answer system will achieve benefits over other competitive multiplex systems  which require extensive sample processing procedures in addition to other complex sample manipulations throughout their test process 
our technology our esensor technology our proprietary esensor technology is based on the principles of competitive dna hybridization and electrochemical detection 
dna naturally forms a double stranded structure  with each strand binding with high affinity  or hybridizing  only to a complementary strand 
our technology takes advantage of this highly specific binding by first creating two types of single stranded dna  the capture probe and the signal probe 
the capture probe and signal probe are each complementary to a different segment of the target dna  or biomarker  that is a focus of the diagnostic test 
using our proprietary technology and processes  we attach our capture probes to a proprietary monolayer on the surface of a gold electrode within our proprietary test cartridge 
we separately attach ferrocene  an electrochemically active label  to our signal probes 
before placing the sample into our test cartridge  the technician mixes the amplified dna sample with our signal probe 
if the target biomarker is present in the prepared patient sample  a segment of the biomarker dna will hybridize with a solution containing our signal probe 
this solution is then run past an electrode  against which our capture probes have been immobilized 
the as yet unbound segment of the target biomarker binds to our capture probe  creating a target dna  signal probe  capture probe complex at the surface of the electrode 
this complex produces an electrochemical signal analyzed and interpreted by the xt system 
our test cartridges currently have distinct electrodes  each of which can be configured to detect a different target biomarker  enabling multiplex testing 
our esensor technology is highly specific for the target biomarker  and is not based on optical or fluorescent detection 
as a result  our diagnostic tests are less prone to sample contamination risk and do not require many of the time consuming washing and preparation steps required by competing technologies 
the only sample preparation step required before using our test cartridges is a polymerase chain reaction  or pcr amplification  which involves amplifying  or generating billions of copies of  the target dna molecules  followed by transfer of the sample to our test cartridge and insertion of the test cartridge into any open slot in our xt system 
in some tests  amplified dna is subject to an additional enzymatic treatment to produce a single stranded dna 
our test cartridges 
our test cartridges are self contained devices specifically programmed and configured for a given diagnostic test 
each test cartridge includes a sample compartment and a plastic cover that forms a hybridization chamber 
the test cartridge is fitted with a diaphragm pump and valves that circulate the hybridization solution  including the signal probe and prepared patient sample  when inserted into the xt system 
the test cartridge also includes a printed circuit board chip consisting of an array of gold plated working electrodes  a silver silver chloride reference electrode  and two gold plated auxiliary electrodes 
each electrode is customized with a proprietary monolayer that immobilizes the dna capture probes specific for 
table of contents each target of a test panel 
the test cartridge also contains an electrically erasable programmable read only memory component that stores information related to the cartridge such as assay identifier  cartridge lot number and expiration date 
our xt workstation 
our xt system is a multiplex workstation that has a modular design consisting of an integrated touch screen workstation and up to three analyzers 
each analyzer contains eight modules into which individual test cartridges are placed 
the test cartridge slots operate independently of each other allowing up to independent test cartridges to be loaded at one time  with the remaining slots available for use at any future time while the system is running 
each slot contains a test cartridge connector  a precision controlled heater  an air pump and electronics 
the air pumps drive the diaphragm pump and valve system in the test cartridge  eliminating fluid contact between the system and the cartridge 
the pneumatic pumping enables recirculation of the hybridization solution allowing the target dna and the signal probes to efficiently hybridize with the complementary capture probes on the electrodes 
the diaphragm pump in the test cartridge is connected to a pneumatic source from the xt system and provides unidirectional pumping of the hybridization mixture through the cartridge during hybridization 
the touch screen workstation controls each analyzer  provides power and analyzes and stores data 
technicians can load patient identification numbers and reagent lot codes by the included bar code scanner  the touch screen or uploading a text file from a usb memory stick 
advantages of our esensor electrochemical signal detection we believe our proprietary electrochemical signal detection technology has several advantages over other signal detection platforms robust signal 
our capture probes are highly target specific  reducing the binding of non target dna and  thereby  largely eliminating interference from other components in a patient s sample  such as blood  saliva or urine 
similarly  constituents of blood that would normally interfere with fluorescence detection  such as hemoglobin or bilirubin  have no effect on the processed electronic signals produced by our esensor technology 
this robust functionality will  we believe  facilitate the development of integrated amplification and sample to answer systems for blood and other sample types 
high sensitivity and accuracy 
our esensor technology is highly sensitive in the detection of nucleic acids 
each electrode can routinely detect approximately nanomolar of target dna  and a sensitivity of picomolar of target dna has been achieved 
such concentrations are readily produced from patient samples using several commercially validated amplification technologies such as pcr 
our esensor technology has demonstrated accuracy in our cystic fibrosis genotyping test  our warfarin sensitivity test and our thrombophilia risk test clinical studies compared to dna sequencing 
streamlined sample preparation 
our technology directly detects the target dna sequence with highly specific signal probes and electrode bound capture probes 
as a result  our test samples do not require many of the washing steps typically required to remove unbound target dna and labels 
we believe that our esensor technology can 
table of contents minimize sample preparation requirements 
we have already demonstrated direct pcr based genotyping from diluted whole blood without the need for dna sample preparation or washing out of interfering substances 
efficient multiplexing 
each of the electrodes in our test cartridge configuration acts independently of the others and produces a comprehensive and informative signal 
for example  a single esensor electrode can measure the presence or absence of control dna  which we use for quality control  and simultaneously indicate whether a patient sample contains zero  one or two copies of a particular sequence  corresponding to mutant  heterozygous or wild type genotypes 
as a result  our esensor technology eliminates the need for redundancy and the averaging of multiple measurements commonly required by competing technologies 
small footprint with low maintenance 
our esensor technology enables users to perform hybridization and detection in a low cost system with relatively few moving parts 
in contrast  conventional microarray systems require robotic instrumentation to automate multistage fluidic handling processes 
as a result  these systems are often bulky  complicated and expensive and require frequent calibration and maintenance 
our xt system  for example  requires no calibration and virtually no maintenance and is self contained in a small footprint of approximately by inches in its standard configuration 
cost effective development 
the use of electrochemical technology allows our xt system to leverage third party advances in microelectronics such as miniaturization and manufacturing efficiencies 
many electronic components associated with our core processes are produced in large volumes at low cost and size for use in numerous fields including automotive  aerospace  information technology and medical devices 
by avoiding the use of fluidic handling and optical or fluorescent detection  we believe our esensor technology can be applied at low cost to numerous testing environments in addition to our current target markets  including field testing and point of care applications 
straightforward development of new tests 
our esensor technology is highly flexible  and we believe the main design consideration in developing new diagnostic tests for our xt system is our ability to access and synthesize the appropriate capture and signal probes 
our versatile platform allows us to add new diagnostic tests to our menu or to add new content to existing diagnostic tests without modifying the xt system 
this ease of assay development and our versatile platform allows us to focus our research and development resources on developing new commercial test products 
functionality outside of molecular diagnostics 
our esensor technology has broad applicability to detect a range of biomolecules 
independently  and through collaborative research with university and industry partners  we have demonstrated esensor detection of proteins and small molecule drugs 
this versatility opens the possibility of developing mixed analyte sensors  such as tests that can detect antibodies to a certain pathogen plus the pathogen itself  or genetic variations in drug metabolism plus monitoring of the drug level itself 

table of contents research and development as of december   we had employees focused on research and development 
our research and development expenditures were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to clinical trial costs incurred for potential product offerings as well as increased staffing and intellectual property related expenses 
in addition to expanding the diagnostic test menu for our xt system and developing our nexgen system  our research and development team is focused on the following initiatives improving the clinical and practical utility of our tests 
an important role of our research and development team is to help establish the clinical utility and value of our molecular diagnostic tests 
we have and intend to continue to partner with academic and reference laboratories to perform validation and clinical studies on our tests 
key aspects of our efforts are aimed at improving workflow in the laboratory setting  positively comparing our tests to historical or gold standard tests and demonstrating that our tests can help improve patient care and lower diagnostic and medical treatment costs 
we intend to publish the results from these clinical studies in peer reviewed or trade journals  submit them to regulatory bodies and present them at industry conferences in support of our commercialization strategy 
developing new test capabilities 
we are developing capabilities for utilizing our esensor technology in protein and small molecule detection  both independently and through research collaborations 
these capabilities may enhance our future menu offerings or provide us with out licensing opportunities 
we are also exploring direct gene expression analysis opportunities through collaboration with oncology specialists in industry and academia 
these opportunities may allow us to develop quantitative tests that are competitive with the gold standard real time pcr tests but that are simple to perform in a multiplex manner with our xt system 
manufacturing we manufacture our proprietary test cartridges and ancillary reagents at our approximately  square foot headquarters in carlsbad 
our reagent formulation  test cartridge manufacturing and packaging of final components and cartridges are performed by us in accordance with applicable guidelines for medical device manufacturing 
we outsource manufacturing of our xt system  as well as the oligonucleotide raw materials and much of the disposable component molding and sub component assembly for our test cartridges 
in particular  our xt system is manufactured by a single source supplier that specializes in contract design and manufacturing of electronic and electromechanical devices for medical use 
we believe we can secure other suppliers on commercially reasonable terms for the products and parts we outsource 
we have implemented a quality management system designed to comply with fda regulations and iso standards governing diagnostic medical device products 
these regulations carefully control the design  manufacture  testing and release of diagnostics products as well as 
table of contents raw material receipt and control 
we also have controlled methods for the consistent manufacturing of our proprietary test cartridges and reagents at our facilities 
all key outsourcing partners are generally iso certified to help assure a continual supply of high quality components 
we plan to continue to manufacture components that we determine are highly proprietary or highly custom to produce  while outsourcing more commodity like components 
we are likely to establish additional outsourcing partnerships as we manufacture additional products 
we recently signed a lease amendment to increase our office and manufacturing facilities to  square feet and believe these facilities will be adequate to meet our current and future manufacturing needs 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing strategy is to expand the installed base and utilization of the xt platform and consumables 
our products are sold in the united states through a geographically dispersed direct sales and technical specialist service organization 
they are supported by a centralized team of product managers  marketing  customer and technical support personnel

we execute a variety of sales campaigns and strategies to meet the buying criteria of the different customer segments we serve 
to support our expanding molecular test menu  growth in our customer base and launch plans of our next generation detection platform  we continue to make investments in these customer facing organizations 
we believe the xt platform competes largely on the basis of improved performance and reliability  ease of use and streamlined laboratory workflow  a high value in vitro diagnostic  or ivd  menu with multiplexing capabilities  and a superior return on investment 
these and other advantages conferred by our chemistry are enabling us to provide clinicians and researchers with superior molecular solutions 
our sales cycle typically includes customer evaluations and validations of our products 
upon successful validation  a customer can acquire our xt system and consumables in the following ways reagent rental the reagent rental agreement requires a customer commitment to purchase a minimum number of cartridges over the term of the agreement  and a portion of the charge for each cartridge is a rental fee for the equipment 
our reagent rental agreements do not typically provide for any cancellation rights by the customer 
capital purchase the xt system is paid for upfront  and in its entirety  by the customer 
customers are also eligible to receive structured pricing incentives if they enter into an optional annual minimum cartridge commitment 
in  we anticipate commencing planning for commercialization of our molecular diagnostic products in europe and other international markets 
we anticipate our sales and marketing strategy will involve a select network of partners and distributors 
a distribution strategy will likely be developed for each relevant international market 
it is expected that we will augment this effort with a team of our specialists who will enable our partners sales forces and 
table of contents provide technical support 
we also intend to explore opportunities to leverage our intellectual property position in molecular diagnostics through licensing or the establishment of partnerships 
customers in and  and of our revenues  respectively  were attributed to our three largest customers during the year 
in  one customer  natural molecular testing corporation  accounted for approximately of our total revenues and in one customer accounted for of our total revenues 
placements are defined in terms of the number of analyzers sold to or placed with a customer  reflecting a direct correlation between the reagent test revenue opportunity and the number of test cartridges that can analyzed at any one time 
as of december   there were analyzers at unique customer sites  or approximately analyzers per customer 
this compares with analyzers at unique customer sites  or approximately analyzers per customer as of december  the increase in analyzers and related revenue is due to an increase in the number of new customers buying our products and growth in the sale of consumables to existing customers 
we expect our clinical molecular diagnostic revenues to continue to increase in competition we primarily face competition in the molecular diagnostic testing markets with testing products and systems developed by public and private companies such as cepheid  gen probe  inc  siemens  hologic  inc  innogenetics  inc  luminex corporation  nanosphere  inc  qiagen nv  roche diagnostics  a division of f 
hoffmann la roche ltd  idaho technologies and abbott diagnostics  a division of abbott laboratories 
our diagnostic tests also face competition with the laboratory developed tests developed by national and regional reference laboratories and hospitals 
we believe that the xt system competes largely on the basis of accuracy and reliability  enhanced laboratory workflow  multiplex capability  ease of use and return on investment for customers 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  research and other resources and larger  more established marketing  sales and distribution organizations than we do 
many of our competitors also offer broader product lines and have greater brand recognition than we do 
moreover  our existing and new competitors may make rapid technological developments that may result in our technologies and products becoming obsolete before we recover the expenses incurred to develop them or before they generate significant revenue 
intellectual property to establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products  we rely on a combination of our patents  copyrights  trademarks  and trade secrets  as well as other intellectual property rights in our technology and business information 
our intellectual property portfolio for our core electrochemical technology was initially built through the combination of our acquisition of the clinical micro sensors business from motorola and licensing patents from third parties  including the california institute of technology and harvard university 

table of contents we believe that our patent portfolio  including over issued us and foreign patents and numerous pending applications  provides us with a robust protection of our electrochemical detection techniques  chemical insulators and attachment points on electrode surfaces and other technology that  collectively  form the staple of our esensor platform 
we continue to pursue the issuance of new patents to protect our ongoing research  development and commercial activities 
in general  patents have a term of years from the application filing date or earlier claimed priority date 
our issued and exclusively licensed patents will expire between and or later  with several of our pending applications having the potential to mature into patents that might expire in  and our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to police infringement  derive licensing revenues and continue to develop proprietary products and technologies without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others 
we also rely in part on trade secret protection of our intellectual property 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties  employees and consultants 
our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in intellectual property such as patents and copyrights arising from their work for us 
all employees sign an agreement not to compete unfairly with us during their employment and upon termination of their employment through the misuse of confidential information  soliciting employees and soliciting customers 
we also have filed for registration  or obtained registration  in the us and other countries for marks used with our products and technology 
our trademarks registered in the us include esensor and genmark 
trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and  in other countries  for as long as it is registered 
registrations generally are for fixed  but renewable  terms 
government regulation the design  development  manufacture  testing and sale of our diagnostic products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities  principally the fda  and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
regulation by the fda in the united states  the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  or fdca  fda regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern  among other things  medical device design and development  preclinical and clinical testing  premarket clearance or approval  registration and listing  manufacturing  labeling  storage  advertising and promotion  sales and distribution  export and import  and post market surveillance 
the fda regulates the design  manufacturing  servicing  sale and distribution of medical devices  including molecular diagnostic test kits and instrumentation systems 
failure to comply with applicable us requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions  such as fda refusal to approve pending applications  warning letters  product recalls  product seizures  total or partial suspension of production or distribution  injunctions  fines  civil penalties and criminal prosecution 

table of contents unless an exemption applies  each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the united states will require marketing authorization from the fda prior to distribution 
the two primary types of fda marketing authorization applicable to a device are premarket notification  also called k clearance  and premarket approval  also called pma approval 
the type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device 
the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes class i  ii or iii based on the degree of risk the fda determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device s safety and effectiveness 
devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in class i or ii 
class i devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices  such as requirements for device labeling  premarket notification and adherence to the fda s current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  and quality system requirements  as reflected in its qsr 
class ii devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards  product specific guidance documents  special labeling requirements  patient registries or postmarket surveillance 
class iii devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls and include life sustaining  life supporting or implantable devices  devices of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health  or which present a potential  unreasonable risk of illness or injury 
most class i devices and some class ii devices are exempted by regulation from the k clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from the fda 
some class i devices that have not been so exempted and class ii devices are eligible for marketing through the k clearance pathway 
by contrast  devices placed in class iii generally require pma approval or k de novo clearance prior to commercial marketing 
the pma approval process is more stringent  time consuming and expensive than the k clearance process  however  the k clearance process has also become increasingly stringent and expensive 
the fda has cleared our xt system with our esensor warfarin sensitivity test  cystic fibrosis genotyping test and thrombophilia risk test as class ii devices via the k clearance process 
k clearance 
to obtain k clearance for a medical device  an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a device legally marketed in the united states that is not subject to pma approval  commonly known as the predicate device 
a device is substantially equivalent if  with respect to the predicate device  it has the same intended use and has either i the same technological characteristics or ii different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness 
a showing of substantial equivalence sometimes  but not always  requires clinical data 
generally  the k clearance process can exceed days and may extend to a year or more 
after a device has received k clearance for a specific intended use  any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness  such as a significant change in the design  materials  method of manufacture or intended use  may require a new k clearance or pma approval and payment of an fda user fee 
the determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the 
table of contents manufacturer using available fda guidance  however  the fda may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until k clearance or pma approval is obtained 
the manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 
before we can submit a medical device for k clearance  we may have to perform a series of generally short studies over a period of months  including method comparison  reproducibility  interference and stability studies to ensure that users can perform the test successfully 
some of these studies may take place in clinical environments  but are not usually considered clinical trials 
for pma submissions  we would generally be required to conduct a longer clinical trial over a period of years that supports the clinical utility of the device and how the device will be used 
although clinical investigations of most devices are subject to the investigational device exemption  or ide  requirements  clinical investigations of molecular diagnostic tests  including our products and products under development  are generally exempt from the ide requirements 
thus  clinical investigations by intended users for intended uses of our products generally do not require the fda s prior approval  provided the clinical evaluation testing is non invasive  does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents a significant risk  does not intentionally introduce energy into the subject and is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation by another medically established test or procedure 
in addition  our products must be labeled per fda regulations for research use only ruo or for investigational use only iuo  and distribution controls must be established to assure that our products distributed for research  method comparisons or clinical evaluation studies are used only for those purposes 
pma approval 
a pma application requires the payment of significant user fees 
pma applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence  which typically requires extensive data  including technical  preclinical  clinical and manufacturing data  to demonstrate to the fda s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device 
a pma application must also include  among other things  a complete description of the device and its components  a detailed description of the methods  facilities and controls used to manufacture the device  and proposed labeling 
the fda has days from its receipt of a pma to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review 
once the submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review 
during this review period  the fda may request additional information or clarification of information already provided 
in addition  the fda will conduct a pre approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the qsr  which requires manufacturers to follow design  testing  control  documentation and other quality assurance procedures 

table of contents fda review of an initial pma application is required by statute to take between six to ten months  although the process typically takes significantly longer  and may require several years to complete 
the fda can delay  limit or deny approval of a pma application for many reasons  including it is not demonstrated that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe or effective under the conditions of use prescribed  recommended  or suggested in the proposed labeling  the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval  and the manufacturing process  methods  controls or facilities used for the manufacture  processing  packing or installation of the device do not meet applicable requirements 
if the fda evaluations of both the pma application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter  which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the pma 
if the fda s evaluation of the pma or manufacturing facilities is not favorable  the fda will deny approval of the pma or issue a not approvable letter 
a not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and  where practical  will identify what is necessary to make the pma approvable 
the fda may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary  in which case the pma approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the pma 
once granted  pma approval may be withdrawn by the fda if compliance with post approval requirements  conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing 
approval by the fda of new pma applications or pma supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process  labeling  device specifications  materials or design of a device that is approved through the pma process 
pma supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial pma application  except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original pma application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 
regulation after fda clearance or approval 
any devices we manufacture or distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the fda are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies 
we are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cgmp requirements  as set forth in the qsr  which include  among other things  testing  control and documentation requirements 
non compliance with these standards can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recalls or seizures of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant k clearance or pma approval of devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions 
we have designed and implemented our manufacturing facilities under the fda s cgmp requirements 
because we are a manufacturer of medical devices  we must also comply with medical device reporting requirements by reviewing and reporting to the fda whenever there is evidence that 
table of contents reasonably suggests that one of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury 
we must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 
labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain circumstances  by the federal trade commission 
medical devices approved or cleared by the fda may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses  otherwise known as off label promotion 
the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses  and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability  including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution 
environmental regulations 
we are also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
some of these laws require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our operations 
we have numerous policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with these laws and to minimize the risk of occupational exposure to hazardous materials 
we do not expect the operations of our products to produce significant quantities of hazardous or toxic waste or radiation that would require use of extraordinary disposal practices 
although the costs to comply with these applicable laws and regulations have not been material  we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced  nor can we ensure we will be able to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits 
export of our products 
export of products subject to the k notification requirements  but not yet cleared to market  is permitted with fda authorization provided certain requirements are met 
unapproved products subject to the pma approval requirements may be exported if the exporting company and the device meet certain criteria  including  among other things  that the device complies with the laws of the receiving country and the company submits a simple notification to the fda when the company begins to export 
if the company or device does not comply with such criteria  fda approval must be obtained for export 
to obtain fda export approval  if required  we must meet certain requirements  including  among other things and with some exceptions  documentation demonstrating that the product is approved for import into the country to which it is to be exported and  in some instances  safety data to demonstrate that export of the device will not be contrary to the public health or safety 
clinical laboratory improvement amendments of the use of our products is also affected by the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of  or clia  and related federal and state regulations  which provide for regulation of laboratory testing 
any customers using our products for clinical use in the united states will be regulated under clia  which is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of laboratory testing in the united states 
in particular  these regulations mandate that clinical laboratories must be certified by the federal government or a federally approved accreditation agency  or must be located in a state that has been deemed exempt from clia requirements because the state has in effect laws that provide for requirements equal to or more stringent than clia requirements 
moreover  these laboratories must meet quality assurance  quality control and personnel standards  and they must undergo 
table of contents proficiency testing and inspections 
the clia standards applicable to clinical laboratories are based on the complexity of the method of testing performed by the laboratory  which range from waived to moderate complexity to high complexity 
we expect that most of our products will be categorized as high complexity  since most molecular diagnostic tests are currently fda cleared as clia high complexity devices 
other legislation 
on september   the president signed the food and drug administration amendments act of  or fdaaa 
among other significant changes and requirements it imposes  the new legislation expands the federal government s clinical trial registry and results databank maintained by the national institiute of health  or nih  to include all with limited exceptions medical device trials 
in particular  it requires certain information about device trials  including a description of the trial  participation criteria  location of trial sites  and contact information  to be sent to nih for inclusion in a publicly accessible database 
in addition  the results of clinical trials that form the primary basis for efficacy claims or are conducted after a device is approved or cleared must be posted to the results databank 
under the fdaaa  companies that violate these and other provisions of the new law are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties 
foreign government regulation 
we intend to market our products in european and other selected international markets 
before doing so  we or our partners and distributors will need to receive regulatory approval 
the regulatory review process for medical devices varies from country to country  and many countries also impose product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements and import restrictions on devices 
each country has its own tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may subject a company to fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
third party payor reimbursements obtaining reimbursement approval for a health care product or service from a government or other third party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific  clinical and health economic data for the use of our products to the payor 
we may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to reimbursement 
even when a payor determines that a product or service is eligible for reimbursement  the payor may impose coverage limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the fda or comparable authorities 
in addition  there is a risk that full reimbursement may not be available for high priced products 
moreover  eligibility for coverage does not imply that any product or service will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that allows our customers to make a profit or cover their costs 
initial or interim reimbursements for products and services  if available  may also not be sufficient to cover costs and may not be made permanent 
successful sales of our products in the united states and other countries will depend on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as private insurance plans  managed care organizations  and medicare and medicaid 
our customers have obtained reimbursement for our cystic fibrosis genotyping test and thrombophilia risk test for the xt system and we believe that each of our tests in development are covered by existing current procedural 
table of contents terminology codes  or cpt codes  and will be eligible for coverage by medicare and medicaid and most third party payors 
however  medicare and medicaid generally do not reimburse providers who use our warfarin sensitivity test 
outside of the united states  health care reimbursement systems vary from country to country  and to the extent we begin to sell our products outside the united states  we may not be able to obtain adequate reimbursement coverage  if any  for our products 
in addition  we may develop tests in the future that do not relate to previously established cpt codes and we may need to obtain new cpt codes in order to obtain reimbursement 
reimbursement by a third party payor depends on a number of factors  including applicable coverage policies and limitations  the level of demand by health care providers and the payor s determination that the use of a new product is medically necessary and represents a clinical advance 
in addition  both government and non government third party payors routinely limit reimbursement coverage and reimbursement amounts for diagnostic tests 
if our customers can not receive sufficient levels of reimbursement when using our products  our ability to sell them will be significantly constrained 
fraud and abuse regulations we are subject to numerous federal and state health care anti fraud laws  including the federal anti kickback statute and false claims act that are intended to reduce waste  fraud and abuse in the health care industry 
these laws are broad and subject to evolving interpretations 
they prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in industries other than health care  including certain payments for consulting and other personal services  some discounting arrangements  the provision of gifts and business courtesies  the furnishing of free supplies and services  and waivers of payments 
in addition  many states have enacted or are considering laws that limit arrangements between medical device manufacturers and physicians and other health care providers and require significant public disclosure concerning permitted arrangements 
these laws are vigorously enforced against medical device manufacturers and have resulted in manufacturers paying significant fines and penalties and being subject to stringent corrective action plans and reporting obligations 
we must operate our business within the requirements of these laws and  if we were accused of violating them  could be forced to expend significant resources on investigation  remediation and monetary penalties 
patient protection and affordable care act our operations will also be impacted by the federal patient protection and affordable care act of  as modified by the health care and education reconciliation act of  which we refer to as the health care act 
the health care act imposes a excise tax on sales of medical devices by manufacturers 
taxable devices include any medical device defined in section h of the fdca and intended for use by humans  with limited exclusions for devices purchased by the general public at retail for individual use 
there is no exemption for small companies  and we expect to begin paying the tax in the health care act also requires 
table of contents manufacturers to report to the department of health and human services detailed information about financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals 
these reporting provisions preempt state laws that require reporting of the same information  but not those that require reports of different or additional information 
failure to comply subjects the manufacturer to significant civil monetary penalties 
we expect compliance with the health care act to impose significant administrative and financial burdens on us 
employees as of december   we had employees 
approximately are involved in research and development  in operations  manufacturing and quality assurance  in sales and marketing  and in finance  legal and other administrative functions 
our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees 
we face competition in this regard from other companies  research and academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement

item a 
risk factors you should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this annual report in evaluating our business and our prospects 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business and financial results could be harmed 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
you should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report  including our financial statements and the related notes 

table of contents risks related to our business we have a history of net losses  and we may never achieve or maintain profitability 
we have a history of significant net losses and a limited history commercializing our molecular diagnostic products 
we obtained fda clearance for our first generation molecular diagnostic system in  and commenced a limited marketing effort for this system 
we commenced offering our xt system and our warfarin sensitivity test in july we commenced offering our cystic fibrosis genotyping test in july and our thrombophilia risk test in april our respiratory viral panel test is currently labeled for ruo and was submitted to the fda for k clearance in december our net losses were approximately million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million in at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we will continue to incur significant expenses for the foreseeable future in connection with our sales and marketing  research and development and regulatory activities and maintaining our existing  obtaining additional intellectual property rights and investing in corporate infrastructure 
we cannot provide you any assurance that we will ever achieve profitability and  even if we achieve profitability  that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
further  because of our limited commercialization history and because the market for molecular diagnostic products is relatively new and rapidly evolving  we have limited insight into the trends that may emerge and affect our business 
we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends  which could harm our business and financial condition 
we will need to raise additional funds in the future  and such funds may not be available on a timely basis  or at all 
if additional capital is not available  we may have to curtail or cease operations 
until such time  if ever  as we can generate substantial product revenues  we will be required to finance our operations with our cash resources 
we will need to raise additional funds in the future to support our operations 
we cannot be certain that additional capital will be available as needed or on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we require additional capital at a time when investment in our company  in molecular diagnostics companies or the marketplace in general is limited  we may not be able to raise such funds at the time that we desire  or at all 
if we do raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities  the percentage ownership of holders of our common stock could be significantly diluted 
in addition  newly issued securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
if we obtain debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations and place encumbrances on our assets 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  we could be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies and products  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 

table of contents if our products do not perform as expected or the reliability of the technology on which our products are based is questioned  our operating results and business will suffer 
our success depends on the market s confidence that we can provide reliable  high quality diagnostic systems and tests 
we believe that customers in our target markets are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and errors 
as a result  our reputation and the public image of our products or technologies will be significantly impaired if our products fail to perform as expected 
although our diagnostic systems are designed to be user friendly  the functions they perform are complex  and our products may develop or contain undetected defects or errors 
if we experience a material defect or error  this could result in loss or delay of revenues  increased costs to produce our tests  delayed market acceptance  damaged reputation  diversion of development and management resources  legal claims  increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also face the risk of product liability exposure related to the sale of our products 
we currently carry product liability insurance that covers us against specific product liability claims 
we also carry a separate general liability and umbrella policy that covers us against certain claims but excludes coverage for product liability 
any claim in excess of our insurance coverage  or for which we do not have insurance coverage  would have to be paid out of our cash reserves  which would harm our financial condition 
we cannot assure you that we have obtained sufficient insurance or broad enough coverage to cover potential claims 
also  we cannot assure you that we can or will maintain our insurance policies on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
a product liability claim could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may fail to successfully expand the menu of diagnostic tests for our xt system or effectively predict the types of tests our existing and target customers want 
we currently market three fda cleared diagnostic tests and have developed one other diagnostic test currently labeled for ruo that has been submitted to the fda for k clearance 
in addition  we have several diagnostic tests in the research  development or design stage 
some hospital based and reference laboratories may not consider adopting our xt system until we offer a broader menu of diagnostic tests 
although we are developing additional tests to respond to the needs of these laboratories  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to license the appropriate technology  successfully develop  or obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals for additional tests  or do so in a manner that is cost effective or timely 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends  as well as precise technological execution 
in addition  in order to commercialize our products  we are required to undertake time consuming and costly development activities  including clinical studies for which the outcome is uncertain 
products that appear promising during early development and preclinical studies may  nonetheless  fail to demonstrate the results needed to support regulatory approval or  if approved  may not generate the demand we expect 
if we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize additional diagnostic tests for use with our xt system  our revenues and our ability to achieve profitability will be significantly impaired 

table of contents we may not be able to manage our anticipated growth  and we may experience constraints or inefficiencies caused by unanticipated acceleration and deceleration of customer demand 
demand for our respiratory viral panel can be seasonal based upon influenza outbreaks 
also  unanticipated changes in customer demand for our products may result in constraints or inefficiencies related to our manufacturing  sales force  implementation resources and administrative infrastructure 
these constraints or inefficiencies may adversely affect us as a result of delays  lost potential product sales or loss of current or potential customers due to their dissatisfaction 
similarly  over expansion or investments in anticipation of growth that does not materialize  or develops more slowly than we expect  could harm our financial results and result in overcapacity 
to manage our anticipated future growth effectively  we must enhance our manufacturing capabilities and operations  information technology infrastructure  and financial and accounting systems and controls 
organizational growth and scale up of operations could strain our existing managerial  operational  financial and other resources 
our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects  such as the development of new products or enhancements of existing products 
if our management is unable to effectively manage our growth  our expenses may increase more than expected  our revenue could grow more slowly than expected and we may not be able to achieve our research and development and commercialization goals 
our failure to manage our anticipated growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we may not be able to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses  which could lead to cash shortfalls 
our operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include the time and resources required to develop  conduct clinical studies and obtain regulatory clearances for the additional diagnostic tests we develop  the expenses we incur for research and development required to maintain and improve our technology  including developing our next generation molecular diagnostic system  the costs of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation 
the expenses we incur in connection with commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the expenses we incur in licensing biomarkers from third parties to expand the menu of diagnostics tests we plan to offer  our sales strategy and whether the revenues from sales of our test cartridges or xt system will be sufficient to offset our expenses  the costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations  and 
table of contents the costs associated with being a public company 
our budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning future revenues from sales of our xt system and diagnostic tests 
we may be unable to reduce our expenditures in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenue 
accordingly  a shortfall in demand for our products could have an immediate and material impact on our business and financial condition 
we face intense competition from established and new companies in the molecular diagnostics field and expect to face increased competition in the future 
the markets for our technologies and products are very competitive  and we expect the intensity of competition to increase 
we compete with many companies in the united states engaged in the development  commercialization and distribution of similar products intended for clinical molecular diagnostic applications 
categories of competitors include companies developing and marketing multiplex molecular diagnostics systems  including luminex corporation  nanosphere  qiagen nv  abbott diagnostics  a division of abbott laboratories  hologic  inc and innogenetics inc  large hospital based laboratories and reference laboratories who provide large scale testing using their own proprietary testing methods including quest diagnostics incorporated and laboratory corporation of america  and companies that manufacture laboratory based tests and analyzers including cepheid  gen probe  inc  siemens  hologic  inc  qiagen nv  roche diagnostics  a division of f 
hoffmann la roche ltd  and abbott diagnostics 
our diagnostic tests also face competition from laboratory developed tests  or ldts  developed by national and regional reference laboratories and hospitals 
such laboratory developed tests may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements  including those requiring clinical trials and fda review and clearance or approval  that may apply to our products 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market with new technologies and our competitors improve their current products and expand their menu of diagnostic tests 
many of our current competitors  as well as many of our potential competitors  have greater name recognition  more substantial intellectual property portfolios  longer operating histories  significantly greater resources to invest in new technologies  more substantial experience in new product development  greater regulatory expertise  more extensive manufacturing and distribution capabilities 
the impact of these factors may result in our technologies and products becoming obsolete before we recover the expenses incurred to develop them or before they generate significant revenue 
we are reliant on the commercial success of our xt system and our diagnostic tests 
we have primarily placed our xt systems with customers at no initial charge through placement agreements  under which customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of test 
table of contents cartridges over a period of generally one to three years  with a component of the reagent cartridge price allocated to recover the instrument cost 
we also offer our xt systems for sale 
we expect sales of our diagnostic tests associated with our xt system will account for the vast majority of our revenues for at least the next several years 
we intend to dedicate a significant portion of our resources to the commercialization of our xt system and our existing fda cleared diagnostic tests 
although we intend to develop a broad range of additional diagnostic tests for use with the xt system  we cannot assure you when or if we will obtain fda clearance for the tests we develop in the future  or whether the market will accept such new products 
as a result  to the extent that our xt system and our existing and future fda cleared diagnostic tests are not commercially successful or are withdrawn from the market for any reason  our revenues will be harmed and our business  operating results and financial condition will be harmed 
we may not be successful in developing our nexgen system 
we are developing a sample to answer platform  the nexgen system 
we are designing this system to integrate automated nucleic acid extraction and amplification with our esensor technology to allow technicians to be able to place a patient sample into our test cartridge and obtain results with significantly reduced or no technician hands on processing time 
the development of the nexgen system is a complex process  and we may not be successful in completing the development of all the currently intended features and benefits of the system  which may limit its marketability 
in addition  before commercializing the nexgen system we will be required to obtain regulatory approval for the system as well as each of the diagnostic tests to be used on the system  including those tests that previously received approval for use with our xt system 
if we are unable to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for our nexgen system and related diagnostic tests  our business plan will be impaired 
additionally  prior to or upon release of our nexgen system  sales of our xt system may decrease as customers migrate over to our newer technology 
our financial results will depend on the acceptance and increased demand among reference laboratories and hospitals  third party payors and the medical community of our molecular diagnostic technology and products 
our future success depends on the acceptance by our target customers  third party payors and the medical community that our molecular diagnostic products are a reliable  medically relevant  accurate and cost effective replacement for other molecular diagnostic testing methods 
medical offices and many hospitals outsource their molecular diagnostic testing needs to national or regional reference laboratories 
our business success depends on our ability to convince these target laboratories and hospitals to replace their current testing platforms and or send out tests  with our xt system and related diagnostic tests 
we must also continue to increase the number of available tests  and test sell through  on our installed systems 
many other factors may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of our molecular diagnostic technology and products  including the relative convenience and ease of use of our diagnostic systems over competing products  
table of contents the introduction of new technologies and competing products that may make our technologies and products a less attractive solution for our target customers  the breadth of our menu of available diagnostic tests relative to our competitors  our success in training reference and hospital based laboratories in the proper use of our products  the acceptance in the medical community of our molecular diagnostic technology and products  the extent and success of our marketing and sales efforts  and general economic conditions 
our success depends on our ability to service and support our products 
to the extent that we fail to maintain a high quality level of service and support for our products  there is a risk that the perceived quality of our products will be diminished in the marketplace 
likewise  we may fail to provide the level  quantity or quality of service expected by the marketplace 
this could result in slower adoption rates and lower than anticipated utilization of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing risks and inefficiencies may adversely affect our ability to produce products  we have a sole source of supply for our xt system 
we must manufacture  or engage third parties to manufacture  components of our products in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis  while maintaining product quality  acceptable manufacturing costs and complying with regulatory requirements 
our components are custom made by only a few outside suppliers 
if we are unable to satisfy our forecasted demand from existing suppliers for our kits and are unable to find alternative suppliers at reasonably comparable prices  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
additionally  we have entered into supply agreements with most of our suppliers of strategic reagents and parts to help ensure component availability and flexible purchasing terms with respect to the purchase of such components 
if our suppliers discontinue production of a key component  we will be required to revalidate and may be required to resubmit a previously cleared product 
in determining the required quantities of our products and the manufacturing schedule  we must make significant judgments and estimates based on inventory levels  current market trends and other related factors 
because of the inherent nature of estimates and our limited experience in marketing our products  there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of products we require 
this can result in shortages if we fail to anticipate demand  or excess inventory and write offs if we order more than we need 
we currently manufacture our proprietary test cartridges at our carlsbad  california manufacturing facility 
we outsource manufacturing of our xt system and much of the 
table of contents disposable component molding and component assembly for our test cartridges 
our xt system is manufactured by aubrey group inc  our single source supplier that specializes in contract design and manufacturing of electronic and electromechanical devices for medical use 
while we work closely with aubrey group inc to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability  we cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful 
should aubrey group inc become unable or unwilling to continue to meet our supply needs  we may experience delays in qualifying a new source or may not obtain as favorable pricing or other terms  any of which could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
reliance on third party manufacturers entails risk to which we would not be subject if we manufactured these components ourselves  including reliance on third parties for regulatory compliance and quality assurance  possible breaches of manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control  possible regulatory violations or manufacturing problems experienced by our suppliers  possible termination or non renewal of agreements by third parties  based on their own business priorities  at times that are costly or inconvenient for us  the potential obsolescence and or inability of our suppliers to obtain required components  the potential delays and expenses of seeking alternate sources of supply or manufacturing services  the inability to qualify alternate sources without impacting performance claims of our products  reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery due to the difficulties in switching to alternate suppliers or assemblers  and increases in prices of raw materials and key components 
we may not be able to meet the demand for our products if one or more of these third party manufacturers are not able or are unwilling to supply us with the necessary components that meet our specifications 
it may be difficult to find alternate suppliers in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us 
the manufacturing operations for our test cartridges use highly technical processes involving unique  proprietary techniques 
in addition  the manufacturing equipment we use would be costly to repair or replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace 
any interruption in our operations or decrease in the production capacity of our manufacturing facility or the facilities of any of our suppliers because of equipment failure  natural disasters such as earthquakes  tornadoes and fires or otherwise  would limit our ability to meet customer demand for the xt system and tests and would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other possible disruptions may include power loss and telecommunications failures 
in the event of a disruption  we may lose customers and we may be unable to regain those 
table of contents customers thereafter 
our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
we have only produced our products in limited quantities  and we may experience problems in scaling our manufacturing operations  or delays or component shortages that could limit the growth of our revenue 
to date  we have produced our products in limited quantities relative to the quantities necessary to achieve desired revenue growth 
we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities or maintain consistency between differing lots of consumables 
if we encounter difficulties in scaling our manufacturing operations as a result of  among other things  quality control and quality assurance issues and availability of components and raw material supplies  we will likely experience reduced sales of our products  increased repair or re engineering costs due to product returns  and defects and increased expenses due to switching to alternate suppliers  any of which would reduce our revenues and gross margins 
although we attempt to match our parts inventory and production capabilities to estimates of marketplace demand  to the extent system orders materially vary from our estimates  we may experience continued constraints in our systems production and delivery capacity  which could adversely impact revenue in a given fiscal period 
should our need for raw materials and components used in production continue to fluctuate  we could incur additional costs associated with either expediting or postponing delivery of those materials 
if we are unable to retain key members of our senior management and scientists or hire additional skilled employees  we may be unable to achieve our goals 
our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our senior management and key scientific and technical personnel 
our senior managers and other key employees can terminate their relationship with us at any time 
we have a small number of senior managers  and the loss of services of any of these managers or our scientific or technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
in addition  our product development and marketing efforts could be delayed or curtailed if we are unable to attract  train and retain highly skilled employees and scientific advisors 
to expand our research  product development and sales efforts  we will need to retain additional people skilled in areas such as electrochemical and molecular science  information technology  manufacturing  sales  marketing and technical support 
because of the complex and technical nature of our systems and the dynamic market in which we compete  any failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially harm our ability to develop and commercialize our technology 
we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel  and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our success may depend upon how we and our competitors anticipate and adapt to market conditions 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs  emerging competition and new product introductions 
new technologies  techniques or products could emerge with similar or better performance or may be perceived as providing better value than our systems and related tests and could exert pricing pressures on our products 
it is critical to our success that we anticipate changes in technology and customer requirements and successfully introduce enhanced and competitive technology to meet our customers and prospective customers needs on a timely basis 
we will need to respond to technological innovation in a rapidly changing industry and may not be able to maintain our technological advantages over emerging technologies in the future 
if we fail to keep pace with emerging technologies  our systems and related tests will become uncompetitive and our market share will decline  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unsuccessful in our long term goal of expanding sales of our product offerings outside the united states 
assuming we receive the applicable regulatory approvals  we intend to market our diagnostic products outside the united states through third party distributors 
these distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to meet our expectations 
if distributors do not perform adequately or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in particular geographic areas  or if we are unable to locate distributors in particular geographic areas  our ability to realize revenue growth based on sales outside the united states would be harmed 
in order to market our products in the european union and many other foreign jurisdictions  we  or our distributors or partners  must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements regarding safety and efficacy and governing  among other things  clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our products 
the approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing 
the regulatory approval process outside the united states may include all of the risks associated with obtaining fda approval  as well as additional risks 
in addition  in many countries outside the united states  it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country 
we may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the united states on a timely basis  if at all  which could harm our ability to expand into markets outside the united states 
if we expand sales of our products outside the united states  our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations 
if we execute our intent to expand our operations outside the united states  our inexperience in operating in foreign countries increases the risk that our international expansion will not be successful 
conducting international operations would subject us to new risks that  generally  we have not faced in the united states  including 
table of contents fluctuations in currency exchange rates  unexpected complexity and changing foreign regulatory requirements  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in managing and staffing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems  tax inefficiencies related to our corporate structure and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards  increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities  hyperinflation  political  social and economic instability abroad  terrorist attacks and security concerns in general  having to comply with a variety of us laws  including the foreign corrupt practices act  and the imposition of restrictive trade policies  including export restrictions  and conducting business in places where business practices and customs are unfamiliar and unknown the occurrence of any one of these risks could harm our business  results of operations and prospects 
additionally  operating internationally requires significant management attention and financial resources 
we cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required in establishing operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenues or profitability 
guidelines  recommendations and studies published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products 
professional societies  government agencies  practice management groups  private health science foundations  and organizations involved in healthcare issues may publish guidelines  recommendations or studies to the healthcare and patient communities 
recommendations of government agencies or these other groups organizations may relate to such matters as usage  cost effectiveness  and use of related products 
organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our competitors products  such as the need for less frequent screening tests  which could result in reduced product sales 
moreover  the perception by the investment community or stockholders that recommendations  guidelines or studies will result in decreased use of our products could adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock 

table of contents our respiratory viral panel test and other menu items that we develop in the future may have sales that fluctuate on a seasonal basis and  as a result  our results of operations for any particular quarter may not accurately reflect full year trends 
our respiratory viral panel test and other tests that we develop in the future may have sales that fluctuate on a seasonal basis 
as a result  our results of operations for any particular quarter may not accurately reflect full year trends 
for example  we expect volume of testing for our respiratory viral panel test generally will decline during the spring and summer season and accelerate during the fall and winter season 
as a result  comparison of our results from quarter to quarter may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year 
we have limited experience in sales and marketing and may be unable to successfully commercialize our xt system and related diagnostic tests 
we have limited marketing  sales and distribution experience and capabilities 
our ability to achieve profitability depends on attracting customers for the xt system  expanding the number of tests we offer  and building brand loyalty 
to successfully perform sales  marketing  distribution and customer support functions ourselves  we face a number of risks  including our ability to attract and retain the skilled support team  marketing staff and sales force necessary to commercialize and gain market acceptance for our technology and our products  the ability of our sales and marketing team to identify and penetrate the potential customer base  including hospitals  national and regional reference laboratories  and the difficulty of establishing brand recognition and loyalty for our products 
in addition  we may seek to enlist one or more third parties to assist with sales  distribution and customer support globally or in certain regions of the world 
if we do seek to enter into these arrangements  we may not be successful in attracting desirable sales and distribution partners  or we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on favorable terms  or at all 
if our sales and marketing efforts  or those of any third party sales and distribution partners  are not successful  our technologies and products may not gain market acceptance  which would harm our business operations 
current economic conditions and the uncertain economic outlook may adversely impact our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
global economic conditions may remain challenging and uncertain for the foreseeable future 
the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
these conditions not only limit our access to capital but also make it extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  and they could cause us and foreign businesses and consumers to slow spending on our products and services  which would delay and lengthen sales cycles 
some of our customers rely on government research grants to fund technology purchases 
if negative trends in 
table of contents the economy affect the government s allocation of funds to research  there may be less grant funding available for certain of our customers to purchase technologies from us 
certain of our customers may face challenges gaining timely access to sufficient credit or may otherwise be faced with budget constraints  which could result in decreased purchases of  or development of products based on  our products or in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us 
if our customers do not make timely payments to us  we may be required to assume greater credit risk relating to those customers  increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding would be negatively impacted 
although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and such losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we may not continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past  especially given the current turmoil of the worldwide economy 
additionally  these economic conditions and market turbulence may also impact our suppliers causing them to be unable to supply in a timely manner sufficient quantities of customized components  thereby impairing our ability to manufacture on schedule and at commercially reasonable costs 
if third party payors increasingly restrict payments for healthcare expenses or fail to adequately pay for multi analytic testing  we may experience reduced sales which would hurt our business and our business prospects 
third party payors  such as government entities and healthcare programs  health maintenance organizations and private insurers  are continually seeking to reduce healthcare expenses 
the federal government has also recently reduced the funding for certain government sponsored healthcare programs which has caused these third party payors to seek further reduction in medical expenses 
the us federal government passed comprehensive healthcare reform in the form of the affordable care act in and is considering revisions to this act 
the affordable care act could further limit government reimbursement to these payors 
these reductions may decrease demand for our products and the price we can charge 
increasingly  medicaid and other third party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical services  including clinical diagnostic tests 
they are also attempting to contain costs by limiting coverage and the reimbursement level of tests and other healthcare products 
in addition  cost containment initiatives by governmental or educational entities or programs may reduce funding for genetic research and development activities and retard the growth of the genetic testing market 
without adequate coverage and reimbursement  consumer demand for tests could decrease 
decreased demand could cause our customers to reduce purchases or to cancel programs or development activities and could cause sales of our products to fall 
in addition  decreased demand could place pressure on us to lower prices on these products or services  resulting in lower margins 
reduced sales or margins would adversely affect our business  profitability and business prospects 
providing xt systems to our customers through reagent rental agreements may harm our liquidity 
the majority of our xt systems are provided to customers via reagent rental agreements  under which customers are afforded the right to use the xt system in return for a commitment to purchase minimum quantities of test cartridges over a period of time 
accordingly  we must incur the expense of manufacturing xt systems well in advance of receiving sufficient revenues 
table of contents from test cartridges to recover our manufacturing expenses 
we also offer our xt systems for sale 
the amount of additional capital we may need to raise depends on the amount of our revenues from sales of test cartridges sold through these reagent rental agreements 
we do not currently sell enough test cartridges to recover all of our fixed manufacturing expenses associated with the production of our systems and test cartridges  and therefore we currently have a high cost of sales relative to revenue  resulting in a gross loss for if we continue not to sell a sufficient number of test cartridges to offset our expenses associated with these reagent rental agreements  our liquidity will be adversely affected 
we use hazardous chemicals  biological materials and infectious agents in our business 
any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
our research  product development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including chemicals  biological materials and infectious disease agents 
our operations produce hazardous waste products 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials 
we may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials  and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these hazardous materials and specified waste products  as well as the discharge of pollutants into the environment and human health and safety matters 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and may impair our research  development and production efforts 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we could incur substantial costs  including civil or criminal fines and penalties  clean up costs or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve and maintain compliance 
in addition  we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended environmental laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced 
our corporate structure may create tax inefficiencies 
as a result of our reorganization in and prior to the reorganization steps that took place in june as described below  osmetech plc was a wholly owned subsidiary of genmark and a controlled foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes 
this organizational structure may have created inefficiencies  as certain types of income and investments of osmetech that otherwise would not be currently taxable under general tax rules  may have become taxable 
in addition  conveyance of intellectual property rights from one subsidiary to another could create taxable income 
distributions from genmark to its operating subsidiaries or amongst the us operating subsidiaries of genmark could have been subject to additional us and foreign income tax withholding and result in lower profits 
during the quarter ended june   the company underwent a corporate reorganization  or reorganization  intended to simplify its us entity structure 
as part of the reorganization  osmetech technologies  inc merged into clinical micro sensors  inc  or cms  with cms surviving 
additionally  osmetech plc converted to a uk limited company for uk legal and tax purposes  and made an entity classification election to be treated as an entity disregarded from genmark diagnostics  inc for us federal income tax purposes 
it is anticipated that the reorganization will not trigger any material us federal or us 
table of contents income tax expense 
additionally  it is anticipated that the post reorganization structure will allow genmark diagnostics  inc to elect to file a consolidated us federal income tax return with its remaining us subsidiaries  cms and osmetech  inc as a result of these steps  all operations will be included in a us federal consolidated tax return and many of the inefficiencies described above are eliminated on a go forward basis  however  the reorganization may result in additional tax liabilities to the company 
our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards might be limited 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for us federal income tax purposes 
these loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts through to the extent these net operating loss carryforwards are available  we intend to use them to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations 
section of the us internal revenue code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership 
as a result  prior or future changes in ownership could put limitations on the availability of our net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  our ability to use the current net operating loss carryforwards might be further limited by the issuance of common stock in the future 
to the extent our use of net operating loss carryforwards is significantly limited  our income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards  which could result in lower profits 
we have determined that we have experienced multiple ownership changes under section of the internal revenue code  as amended  or the code 
we have estimated that approximately million of federal net operating losses may be utilized in the future based on limitations that we have calculated under section of the code 
we are currently analyzing alternative positions and additional factual information that may increase the amount of net operating losses that could subsequently be utilized 
to the extent that this additional information becomes available and could increase net operating losses available for use  we will adjust our deferred tax assets accordingly  with a corresponding adjustment to our valuation allowance 
we also had non us net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million as of december  we are exposed to risks associated with long lived and intangible assets that may become impaired and result in an impairment charge 
the carrying amounts of long lived and intangible assets are affected whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any asset may not be recoverable 
these events or changes might include an inability to successfully deliver an instrument to the marketplace and attain customer acceptance  a change in the rights or use of licensed intellectual property or other matters 
adverse events or changes in circumstances may affect the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be derived from long lived and intangible assets 
if at any time we determine that an impairment has occurred  we will be required to reflect the impaired value as a charge  resulting in a reduction in earnings in the quarter such impairment is identified and a corresponding reduction in our net asset value 
in the past we have incurred  and 
table of contents in the future we may incur  impairment charges 
a material reduction in earnings resulting from such a charge could cause us to fail meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts  which could cause the price of our stock to decline 
failure to comply with covenants in our loan agreements could result in our inability to borrow additional funds and adversely impact our business 
we have entered into a loan and security agreements with square bank 
these loan agreements impose financial and other restrictive covenants on our operations  including covenants relating to our general profitability and our liquidity 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  if we violate these or any other covenants  any outstanding amounts under these agreements could become due and payable prior to their stated maturity dates  the bank could proceed against any collateral in our operating accounts and our ability to borrow funds in the future may be restricted or eliminated 
these restrictions may also limit our ability to pursue business opportunities or strategies that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests 
information technology systems implementation issues or security threats could disrupt our internal operations and adversely affect our financial results 
portions of our information technology infrastructure may experience interruptions  delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with ongoing systems implementation work 
in particular  we have implemented an enterprise resource planning software system 
to more fully realize the potential of this system  we are continually reassessing and upgrading processes and this may be more expensive  time consuming and resource intensive than planned 
any disruptions that may occur in the operation of this system or any future systems or any unauthorized access to our information systems could increase our expenses and adversely affect our ability to report in an accurate and timely manner the results of our consolidated operations  our financial position and cash flows and to otherwise operate our business in a secure environment  all of which could adversely affect our financial results  stock price and reputation 
risks related to regulation the regulatory clearance or approval process is expensive  time consuming and uncertain  and the failure to obtain and maintain required clearances or approvals could prevent us from commercializing our future products 
we are investing in the research and development of new diagnostic tests to expand our menu of testing options  as well as to develop our next generation nexgen system  which we anticipate will reduce the need for sample preparation when using our system 
our products are subject to k clearance or pre market approval by the fda prior to their marketing for commercial use in the united states  and to any approvals required by foreign governmental entities prior to their marketing outside the united states 
in addition  any changes or modifications to a device that has received regulatory clearance or approval that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or would constitute a major change in its intended use  may require the submission of a new application for k clearance  pre market approval or foreign regulatory approvals 

table of contents the k clearance and pre market approval processes  as well as the process of obtaining foreign approvals  can be expensive  time consuming and uncertain 
it generally takes from four to twelve months from submission to obtain k clearance  and from one to three years from submission to obtain pre market approval  however  it may take longer  and k clearance or pre market approval may never be obtained 
delays in receipt of  or failure to obtain  clearances or approvals for future products  including tests that are currently in design or development  would result in delayed  or no  realization of revenues from such products and in substantial additional costs which could decrease our profitability 
we have limited experience in filing fda applications for k clearance and pre market approval 
in addition  we are required to continue to comply with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements once we have obtained clearance or approval for a product 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain or maintain any required clearance or approval on a timely basis  or at all 
any failure to obtain or any material delay in obtaining fda clearance or any failure to maintain compliance with fda regulatory requirements could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if third party payors do not reimburse our customers for the use of our clinical diagnostic products or if reimbursement levels are set too low for us to sell our products at a profit  our ability to sell our products and our results of operations will be harmed 
we sell our products to hospital based and reference laboratories  substantially all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services they provide to their patients from third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid  other domestic and foreign government programs  private insurance plans and managed care programs 
reimbursement decisions by particular third party payors depend upon a number of factors  including each third party payor s determination that use of a product is a covered benefit under its health plan  appropriate and medically necessary for the specific indication  cost effective  and neither experimental nor investigational 
third party payors may deny reimbursement for covered products if they determine that a medical product was not used in accordance with cost effective diagnosis methods  as determined by the third party payor  or was used for an unapproved indication 
third party payors also may refuse to reimburse for procedures and devices deemed to be experimental 
obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from each government or third party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific  clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of our product to each government or third party payor 
we may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement 
for example  medicare and medicaid generally do not reimburse providers who use our warfarin sensitivity test 
in addition  eligibility for coverage does not imply that any product will be covered and reimbursed in all cases or reimbursed at a rate that allows our potential customers to make a profit or even cover their costs 

table of contents in the united states  the american medical association assigns specific cpt codes  which are necessary for reimbursement of diagnostic tests 
once the cpt code is established  the centers for medicare and medicaid services establish reimbursement payment levels and coverage rules under medicaid and medicare  and private payors establish rates and coverage rules independently 
we cannot guarantee that any of our tests are or will be covered by the cpt codes that we believe may be applied to them or that any of our tests or other products will be approved for coverage or reimbursement by medicare and medicaid or any third party payor 
third party payors may nonetheless choose to reimburse our customers on a per test basis based on individual biomarker detection  rather than on the basis of the number of results given by the test 
this may result in reference laboratories  public health institutions and hospitals electing to use separate tests to screen for each disease so that they can receive reimbursement for each test they conduct 
in that event  these entities may purchase separate tests for each disease  rather than products  such as ours  that can be used to return multiple test results 
third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services 
increasingly  medicare  medicaid and other third party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical services  including clinical diagnostic tests 
in addition  medicare s current freeze on its clinical laboratory fee schedule may harm the growth of the molecular diagnostics market for patients in the united states who are over or have specific disabilities 
levels of reimbursement may decrease in the future  and future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors may harm the demand for and reimbursement available for our products  which in turn  could harm pricing and sales 
if our customers are not adequately reimbursed for our products  they may reduce or discontinue purchases of our products  which would cause our revenues to decline 
we are subject to evolving legislative  judicial and ethical standards on use of technology and biotechnology 
the adoption of genetic testing is occurring within the broader context of a myriad of decisions related to genetic patenting and genotyping 
issues associated with health insurance  data access  intellectual property protection  national and international legislative initiatives and other variables may have a significant impact on the wide spread adoption of genetic testing or on specific segments or tests within the genetic testing market  including the adoption of our nexgen system and other of our products that are currently in the development and design stage 
we and our suppliers  contract manufacturers and customers are subject to various governmental regulations  and we may incur significant expenses to comply with  and experience delays in our product commercialization as a result of  these regulations 
our manufacturing processes and facilities  and those of some of our contract manufacturers  are required to comply with the federal qsr  which covers the procedures and documentation of the design  testing  production  control  quality assurance  labeling  packaging  sterilization  storage and shipping of our devices 
the fda enforces the qsr through periodic announced and or unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities 
we and our contract manufacturers have been  and anticipate in the future being  subject to such inspections  as well as to inspections by other federal and state regulatory agencies 

table of contents we must also file reports of device corrections and removals and adhere to the fda s rules on labeling and promotion 
the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses  and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability  including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution 
failure to comply with applicable fda requirements  or later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes  including our failure or the failure of one of our contract manufacturers to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse qsr inspection  can result in  among other things administrative or judicially imposed sanctions  injunctions or the imposition of civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  total or partial suspension of production or distribution  the fda s refusal to grant pending future clearance or pre market approval for our products  withdrawal or suspension of marketing clearances or approvals  clinical holds  warning letters  refusal to permit the import or export of our products  and criminal prosecution 
any of these actions  in combination or alone  could prevent us from marketing  distributing or selling our products and would likely harm our business 
in addition  a product defect or regulatory violation could lead to a government mandated or voluntary recall by us 
we believe that the fda would request that we initiate a voluntary recall if a product was defective or presented a risk of injury or gross deception 
regulatory agencies in other countries have similar authority to recall devices because of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could endanger health 
any recall would divert management attention and financial resources  could cause the price of our shares of common stock to decline and expose us to product liability or other claims  including contractual claims from parties to whom we sold products and harm our reputation with customers 
a recall involving our xt system or our fda cleared diagnostic tests would be particularly harmful to our business and financial results 
the use of our diagnostic products by our customers is also affected by the clia  and related federal and state regulations that provide for regulation of laboratory testing 
clia is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the united states by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications  administration  participation in proficiency testing  patient test management  quality assurance and quality control and inspections 
current or 
table of contents future clia requirements or the promulgation of additional regulations affecting laboratory testing may prevent some laboratories from using some or all of our diagnostic products 
legislative or regulatory healthcare reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of our products and to produce  market and distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained 
from time to time  legislation is drafted and introduced in congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory clearance or approval  manufacture and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof 
in addition  fda regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the fda in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products 
for example  in the future  the fda may require more burdensome premarket approval of our system or diagnostic tests rather than the k clearance process we have used to date and anticipate primarily using in the future 
any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of our products 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for our new products would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
federal and state governments in the united states are also undertaking efforts to control growing health care costs through legislation  regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and third party payors 
in march  congress enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation known as the patient protection and affordable care act of  or the ppaca 
while the ppaca involves expanding coverage to more individuals  it includes new regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs 
the ppaca also imposes significant new taxes on medical device manufacturers that are expected to cost the medical device industry up to billion over the next decade 
there are also stringent new reporting requirements of financial relationships between device manufacturers and physicians and teaching hospitals 
complying with ppaca could significantly increase our tax liabilities and costs  which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
our operations will also be impacted by the ppaca  as modified by the health care act 
the health care act imposes a excise tax on sales of medical devices by manufacturers 
taxable devices include any medical device defined in section h of the fdca  and intended for use by humans  with limited exclusions for devices purchased by the general public at retail for individual use 
there is no exemption for small companies  and we expect to begin paying the tax in the health care act also requires manufacturers to report to the department of health and human services detailed information about financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals 
these reporting provisions preempt state laws that require reporting of the same information  but not those that require reports of different or additional information 
failure to comply subjects the manufacturer to significant civil monetary penalties 
we expect compliance with the health care act to impose significant administrative and financial burdens on us 

table of contents we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse  including anti kickback  self referral  false claims and fraud laws  and any violations by us of such laws could result in fines or other penalties 
our commercial  research  and other financial relationships with healthcare providers and institutions are subject to various federal and state laws intended to prevent health care fraud and abuse 
the federal anti kickback statute prohibits the knowing offer  receipt or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by medicare  medicaid or other federal health care programs 
remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value  including cash  improper discounts  and free or reduced price items and services 
many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payors 
violations of the anti kickback laws can result in exclusion from federal health care programs and substantial civil and criminal penalties 
the federal false claims act  or the fca  imposes liability on persons who  among other things  present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal health care program 
the fca has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent  that are for services not provided as claimed  or for services that are not medically necessary 
the fca includes a whistleblower provision that allows individuals to bring actions on behalf of the federal government and share a portion of the recovery of successful claims 
if our marketing or other arrangements were determined to violate anti kickback or related laws  including the fca  then our revenues could be adversely affected  which would likely harm on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
state and federal authorities have aggressively targeted medical device companies for alleged violations of these anti fraud statutes  based on improper research or consulting contracts with doctors  certain marketing arrangements that rely on volume based pricing  off label marketing schemes and other improper promotional practices 
companies targeted in such prosecutions have paid substantial fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more  have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans  and have often become subject to consent decrees severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business 
if we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our contractual relationships with providers or institutions  or our marketing and promotional practices  we could face similar sanctions which would materially harm our business 
to the extent we commence commercial operations overseas  we will be subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act  or the fcpa  and other countries anti corruption anti bribery regimes  such as the uk bribery act 
the fcpa prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees  consultants  sales agents or distributors may be ineffective  and violations of the fcpa and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions  or other liabilities or proceedings against us  any of which would likely harm our reputation  business  financial condition and result of operations 

table of contents risks related to our intellectual property we rely on third party license agreements for patents and other technology related to our products 
the termination of these agreements could delay or prevent us from being able to commercialize our products and the failure to negotiate new licenses could prevent us from expanding our menu of diagnostic products 
we depend on licenses to certain patents and patent applications that are related to electrochemical detection technology and other technology used in our molecular diagnostic systems and test cartridges 
these licenses include both exclusive and non exclusive arrangements 
many of these exclusive licenses obligate us to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the subject inventions of the licensed patents  and if we fail to meet this obligation  we could lose one or more of those licenses 
if  following such an event  any of our licensors were to provide a license to these patents to one or more of our competitors  our ability to compete in the market may be diminished 
furthermore  if we fail to comply with our material obligations under any of our patent license agreements  the licenses may be terminated and we could lose license rights that are important to our business 
the exclusive and non exclusive licenses expire at various times  corresponding to the subject patents or patent applications  the expirations of which currently range from to we expect that we will need to license other technology or patents to commercialize future products  including licenses to additional biomarkers to expand our menu of diagnostic tests 
these licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  which could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects 
we may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to the protection of our patents and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect our rights to our technology 
if we or any of our licensors choose to go to court to stop a third party from using the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents  that third party may ask the court to rule that the patents are invalid and should not be enforced against that third party 
these lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of these patents 
in addition  there is a risk that the court will decide that these patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop others from using the inventions 
there is also the risk that  even if the validity of these patents is upheld  the court will refuse to stop the other party on the ground that such other party s activities do not infringe our patents 
in addition  the us supreme court and the court of appeals for the federal circuit have recently changed certain tests regarding granting patents and assessing the validity of patent claims 
as a consequence  issued patents may be found to contain invalid claims according to the newly revised and currently evolving standards 
some of our own or in licensed patents may be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation or significant narrowing of claim scope in a re examination proceeding before the patent and trademark office  or the pto  or during litigation  under the revised criteria which make it more difficult to obtain patents 

table of contents we may also not be able to detect infringement against our own or in licensed patents  which may be especially difficult for methods of use 
while we intend to take actions reasonably necessary to enforce our patent rights  we depend  in part  on our licensors and collaborators to protect a substantial portion of our proprietary rights 
our products could infringe patent rights of others  which may require costly litigation and  if we are not successful  could cause us to pay substantial damages or limit our ability to commercialize our products 
our commercial success depends on our ability to develop  manufacture and market our systems and tests and use our proprietary technology without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 
as the molecular diagnostic industry expands and more patents are issued  the risk increases that there may be patents issued to third parties that relate to our products and technology of which we are not aware or that we must challenge to continue our operations as currently contemplated 
our products may infringe or may be alleged to infringe these patents 
in addition  some patent applications in the united states may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued  because patent applications in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications or that we were the first to invent the technology 
another party may have filed  and may in the future file  patent applications covering our products or technology similar to ours 
any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications or patents  which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies 
if another party has filed a us patent application on inventions similar to ours  we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the pto to determine priority of invention in the united states 
the costs of these proceedings could be substantial  and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own invention  resulting in a loss of our us patent position with respect to such inventions 
there is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device  biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries generally 
if a third party claims that we or any collaborator infringes its intellectual property rights  we may face a number of issues  including  but not limited to infringement and other intellectual property claims which  regardless of merit  may be expensive and time consuming to litigate and may divert our management s attention from our core business  substantial damages for infringement  which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product at issue infringes on or violates the third party s rights  and if the court finds that the infringement was willful  we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the patent owner s attorneys fees  a court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our product unless the third party licenses its product rights to us  which it is not required to do  
table of contents if a license is available from a third party  we may have to pay substantial royalties  upfront fees or grant cross licenses to intellectual property rights for our products  and redesigning our products or processes so they do not infringe  which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources 
in addition  any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations 
we may be infringing on the patent rights of third parties  which could prevent us from selling our current or future products 
from time to time we may become engaged in litigation with third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our products or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights 
these third parties and others who may in the future threaten us with such litigation  are or may be better capitalized and have more resources than us 
in addition  in order to commercialize certain new or existing tests  we may be required to license certain biomarkers or risk that a third party may claim that the use of certain biomarkers in our tests infringes their intellectual property rights 
we have received correspondence bringing to our attention certain patent rights held by third parties and offering to discuss licensing terms to the patents 
some of these letters relate to patents that are important to our products 
independently  we have also identified patents held by third parties that cover one or more of our products or planned products 
although we have taken licenses to numerous such third party patents  we have also declined to license certain patents in instances where we do not believe our existing products infringe valid claims 
in may  we received correspondence from caliper life sciences  inc  or caliper  alleging that fluid handling technologies utilized in our test cartridges infringe certain microfluidic patents held by caliper and demanding that we take a license to its patents or else caliper would institute litigation against us 
on november   we filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against caliper in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
in our complaint  we requested a declaration from the court that certain of caliper s microfluidic patents were invalid  and that we did not infringe on these patents 
on february   we entered into an agreement with caliper pursuant to which we agreed to dismiss our action for declaratory judgment  without prejudice  and caliper agreed not to assert infringement by us on these patents for a period of six months 
on august  we amended and restated our agreement with caliper and agreed not to file or re file a complaint  or to request reexamination of  certain caliper patents prior to february   and caliper agreed not to file any claims against genmark asserting infringement of certain patents prior to february  after february   caliper may again assert that we are infringing its patents and that we are required to take a license to its patents and could institute legal action 
if one of caliper s patents or any other third party patents were found to be valid and cover any of our products  or use of our proprietary technologies  we or any collaborator could be enjoined from using or selling our products by a court and or required to pay damages and could be unable to commercialize our products or product candidates or use our proprietary technologies unless we or they obtained a license to the patent 
a license may not be available to us or any collaborator on acceptable terms  
table of contents or at all  which could potentially prevent us from selling our current products  using our core technologies or developing new tests 
in addition  during litigation  the patent holder could obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable relief that could prohibit us from making  using or selling our products  technologies or methods pending a trial on the merits  which could be years away 
furthermore  such litigation can be extremely costly and could significantly affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel if we are unable to obtain  maintain and enforce intellectual property protection covering our products  others may be able to make  use  or sell products substantially the same as ours  which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market 
our commercial success is dependent in part on obtaining  maintaining and enforcing intellectual property rights  including patents 
if we are unable to obtain  maintain and enforce intellectual property protection covering our products  others may be able to make  use or sell products that are substantially the same as ours without incurring the sizeable development and licensing costs that we have incurred  which would adversely affect our ability to compete in the market 
we seek to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights to restrict the ability of others to market products that compete with our products 
currently  our patent portfolio is comprised  on a worldwide basis  of over issued us and foreign patents and numerous pending applications 
in general  patents have a term of years from the application filing date or earlier claimed priority date 
our issued and exclusively licensed patents will expire between and or later  with several of our pending applications having the potential to mature into patents that might expire in  and however  patents may not be issued based on any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us and  moreover  issued patents owned or licensed to us now or in the future may be found by a court to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable 
also  even if our patents are determined by a court to be valid and enforceable  they may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from marketing products similar to ours or designing around our patents  despite our patent rights  nor provide us with freedom to operate unimpeded by the patent rights of others 
we have also licensed certain intellectual property from third parties related to our products  and we rely on them to file and prosecute patent applications and maintain patents and otherwise protect the licensed intellectual property 
we have not had and do not have primary control over these activities for certain of our patents or patent applications and other intellectual property rights 
we cannot be certain that such activities by third parties have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights 
pursuant to the terms of the license agreements with some of our licensors  the licensors may have the right to control enforcement of our licensed patents or defense of any claims asserting the invalidity of these patents and even if we are permitted to pursue such enforcement or defense  we will require the cooperation of our licensors 
we cannot be certain that our licensors will allocate sufficient resources or prioritize their or our enforcement of such patents or defense of such claims to protect our interests in the licensed patents 
the patent positions of medical device companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved 
no 
table of contents consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in patents in these fields has emerged to date in the united states or in many foreign jurisdictions 
both the us supreme court and the court of appeals for the federal circuit have made  and will likely continue to make  changes in how the patent laws of the us are interpreted 
in addition  congress is regularly considering legislation that might change provisions of the patent law 
we cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws which might be enacted into law 
those changes may materially affect our patents  our ability to obtain patents or the patents and applications of our collaborators and licensors 
the patent situation in the medical device and disease diagnostic fields outside the united states is even more uncertain 
future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage 
for example others may be able to make systems or devices that are similar to ours but that are not covered by the claims of our patents  we may not be able to identify potential infringers of our technology due in part to the large number of competitors in the field  we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications  we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions  our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents  our issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by third parties  the claims of our issued patents or patent applications when issued may not cover our device or product candidates  there may be dominating patents relevant to our product candidates of which we are not aware  there may be prior public disclosures that could invalidate our inventions or parts of our inventions of which we are not aware  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable 
we have a number of foreign patents and applications 
however  the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states  and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in obtaining  protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions 
if we encounter such difficulties or we are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions  our business prospects could be substantially harmed 

table of contents we also rely on trade secret protection to protect our interests in proprietary know how and for processes for which patents are difficult to obtain or enforce 
we may not be able to protect our trade secrets adequately 
we have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our licensors  collaborators and suppliers 
although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets  our employees  consultants  contractors  outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors 
enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming  and the outcome is unpredictable 
in addition  courts outside the united states are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets 
we rely  in part  on non disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and other parties to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary technology 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
moreover  others may independently develop equivalent proprietary information  and third parties may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge 
any disclosure of confidential data into the public domain or to third parties could allow our competitors to learn our trade secrets and use the information in competition against us 
the us government has certain rights to use and disclose some of the intellectual property that we license and could exclusively license it to a third party if we fail to achieve practical application of the intellectual property 
aspects of the technology licensed by us under agreements with third party licensors may be subject to certain government rights 
government rights in inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a government funded program may include a non exclusive  royalty free worldwide license to practice such inventions for any governmental purpose 
in addition  the us government has the right to require us or our licensors as applicable to grant licenses which would be exclusive under any of such inventions to a third party if they determine that adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions in a particular field of use  such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs  or such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations 
further  the government rights include the right to use and disclose  without limitation  technical data relating to licensed technology that was developed in whole or in part at government expense 
at least one of our technology license agreements contains a provision recognizing these government rights 
we may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers 
as is common in our industry  we employ individuals who were previously employed at other molecular diagnostics or medical device companies  including our competitors or potential competitors 
although no claims against us are currently pending  we may be subject to claims that these employees  or we  have used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers 
litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims 
even if we are successful in defending against these claims  litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management 

table of contents risks related to ownership of our common stock the market price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate significantly  which could result in substantial losses for stockholders and subject us to litigation 
the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations 
among the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this risk factors section and other factors  including fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of our competitors  changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts  variance in our financial performance from the expectations of securities analysts  changes in the estimates of the future size and growth rate of our markets  changes in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles  which could affect our financial results  failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success  conditions and trends in the markets we serve  changes in general economic  industry and market conditions  success of competitive products and services  changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  announcements of significant new products  contracts  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  the timing and outcome of regulatory reviews and approvals of our products  changes in legislation or regulatory policies  practices or actions  the commencement or outcome of litigation involving our company  our general industry or both  recruitment or departure of key personnel  changes in our capital structure  such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt  actual or expected sales of our common stock by the holders of our common stock  and the trading volume of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market in general  the nasdaq global market and the market for diagnostics companies in particular may experience a loss of investor confidence 
a loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our business  our financial condition or results of operations 
these broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price 
table of contents of our common stock and expose us to securities class action litigation 
class action litigation  even if unsuccessful  could be costly to defend and divert management s attention and resources  which could further materially harm our financial condition and results of operations 
future sales of our common stock may depress our share price 
as of december   we had  shares of our common stock outstanding 
sales of a number of shares of common stock in the public market  or the expectation of such sales  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  our equity incentive plan provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance under the plan  which may  among other things  result in dilution of the price of our common stock 
we may also sell additional common stock in subsequent public offerings  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies in the united states  which may harm our operating results  and failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could cause investors to lose confidence in our operating results and in the accuracy of our financial reports and could harm our business and the price of our common stock 
as a public company in the united states  we are required  pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or section  to furnish a report by management on  among other things  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
our first report on compliance with section is in connection with our financial statements for the fiscal year ending december  the controls and other procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  is disclosed accurately and is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms 
if we or our auditors were unable to certify that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and in compliance with section  we may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities such as the sec or the nasdaq global market and we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which would materially harm our business and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets 
furthermore  as a public company listed in the united states  we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses 
in addition  changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including regulations implemented by the sec and the nasdaq global market  may increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming 
these laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and  as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new 
table of contents laws  regulations and standards  we fail to comply  regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed 
failure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  on committees of our board of directors or as members of senior management 
we do not expect to declare any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to invest our future earnings  if any  to fund the development and growth of our business 
in addition  pursuant to our loan and security agreement with square bank  we are restricted from paying any dividends 
the payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations  capital requirements  financial condition  future prospects  restrictions imposed by applicable law  any limitations on payments of dividends present in any debt agreements we may enter into and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant 
consequently  stockholders may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation  which may never occur  as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment 
investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could make an acquisition of our company  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove the current members of our board and management 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage  delay or prevent a merger  acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares 
furthermore  these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors 
these provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock  thereby depressing the market price of our common stock 
stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so 
these provisions allow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors  provide that our stockholders may only remove our directors for cause  establish a classified board of directors  such that not all members of the board of directors may be elected at one time  authorize our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval up to  shares of common stock  that  if issued  would dilute our stock ownership and could operate as a poison pill to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors  
table of contents authorize our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval up to  shares of preferred stock  the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the board of directors that  if issued  could operate as a poison pill to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors  require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting or by unanimous written consent  establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings  limit who may call stockholder meetings  and require the approval of the holders of of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote in order to amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws

overview genmark diagnostics  inc  or genmark  was formed by osmetech plc  or osmetech  as a delaware corporation in february and had no operations prior to its initial public offering which was completed in june immediately prior to the closing of the initial public offering  genmark acquired all of the outstanding ordinary shares of osmetech in a reorganization under the applicable laws of the united kingdom 
as a result of the reorganization  all of the issued ordinary shares in osmetech were cancelled in consideration of i the issuance of common stock of genmark to the former shareholders of osmetech and ii the issuance of new shares in osmetech to genmark 
following the reorganization  osmetech became a subsidiary controlled by genmark  and the former shareholders of osmetech began to hold shares of genmark 
any historical discussion of genmark relates to osmetech and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the reorganization 
we are a molecular diagnostics company focused on developing and commercializing our proprietary esensor detection technology 
our proprietary electrochemical technology enables fast  accurate and highly sensitive detection of up to distinct biomarkers in a single sample 
our xt system received k clearance from the food and drug administration  or fda  and is designed to support a broad range of molecular diagnostic tests with a compact and easy to use workstation and self contained  disposable test cartridges 
within minutes of receipt of an amplified dna sample  our xt system produces clear and accurate results 
our xt system supports up to independent test cartridges  which can be run independently  resulting in a highly convenient and flexible workflow for our target customers  which are hospitals and reference laboratories 
as of december   we had an installed base of analyzers  or placements  with our customers 
our products we have developed six tests for use with our xt system and expect to expand this test menu by introducing two to four new tests annually 
our cystic fibrosis genotyping test  which detects pre conception risks of cystic fibrosis  our warfarin sensitivity test  which determines an individual s ability to metabolize the oral anticoagulant warfarin  and our thrombophilia risk test  which detects an individual s increased risk of blood clots  have received fda clearance 
our esensor technology has demonstrated accuracy in clinical studies in our cystic fibrosis genotyping test  our warfarin sensitivity test and our thrombophilia risk test as 
table of contents compared to dna sequencing 
we have also developed a respiratory viral panel test which detects the presence of major respiratory viruses that has been submitted to the fda for k clearance 
we also released our hepatitis c virus genotyping hcvg test which identifies the type and sub type of the hepatitis c virus as an ruo test in we plan to conduct clinical studies with our hcvg test with the goal of the submission to the fda for clearance or approval 
we also have a pipeline of several additional potential products in different stages of development or design  including diagnostic tests for variants in the cytochrome p c gene and for mutations in a gene known as kras  which is predictive of a tumor s response to certain prescribed anti cancer therapies 
we currently intend to initiate clinical studies in with respect to our c test with the goal of submission to the fda for clearance or approval 
our technology we are also developing our next generation platform  the nexgen system 
we are designing the nexgen system to integrate automated nucleic acid extraction and amplification with our esensor detection technology to enable technicians using the nexgen system to be able to place a patient sample into our test cartridge and obtain results without any additional steps 
this sample to answer capability is enabled by the robust nature of our esensor detection technology  which is not impaired by sample impurities that we believe hinder competing technologies 
we are designing our nexgen system to further simplify workflow and provide powerful  cost effective molecular diagnostics solutions to a significantly expanded group of hospitals and reference laboratories 
since inception  we have incurred net losses from continuing operations each year  and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
our losses attributable to continuing operations for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our operations to date have been funded principally through sales of capital stock and sale of our previous business 
we expect to incur increasing expenses over the next several years  principally to develop additional diagnostic tests  as well as to further increase our spending to manufacture  sell and market our products 
financial results overview revenue revenue from continuing operations includes product sales  principally of our diagnostic tests for use with our xt system 
we primarily place our xt system with customers through a reagent rental agreement  under which customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of test cartridges over a period of one to three years 
we also offer our xt system for sale 
revenue also includes licensing revenue from the out licensing of our electrochemical detection technology 
in addition  revenue generated from service agreements recognized using the proportional performance method of accounting is included in this category 
we may enter into additional sub licenses of our technology generating additional revenue  but do not anticipate that this will provide a significant portion of our future revenue 

table of contents our growth plans focus on both reagent rental agreements and system sales of our current xt system and our next generation nexgen system that is currently under development 
we plan to expand our base of customers and systems as well as adding more tests for use with our systems 
we believe these developments will drive accelerated use of our test cartridges  which we expect to be our primary source of revenue 
cost of sales cost of sales includes the cost of materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs used in the manufacture of our consumable test kits for our xt system  including royalties on product sales 
cost of sales also includes depreciation on revenue generating systems that have been placed with our customers under a reagent rental agreement  and amortization of licenses related to our products 
our xt systems are procured from a contract manufacturer and generally capitalized as fixed assets and depreciated on a straight line basis over their useful life as a charge to cost of sales 
we expect our costs of sales to increase as we place additional xt systems and manufacture and sell an increasing menu of accompanying diagnostic tests 
we manufacture our test cartridges in our facility and have significant capacity for expansion 
this underutilized capacity results in a high cost of sales relative to revenue  resulting in a gross loss 
we believe cost of sales as a percentage of revenue will decrease as our sales of test cartridges grow 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing include those costs associated with our direct sales force  sales management  marketing  technical support and business development departments 
these expenses primarily consist of salaries  commissions  benefits  share based compensation  product shipment costs  travel  advertising and promotions 
we expect sales and marketing costs to increase as we scale up our commercial efforts to drive an increased customer base 
research and development expenses research and development expenses primarily include expenses related to the development of our xt system  including the detection system and the test cartridges 
these expenses also included clinical study expenses incurred in the process of preparing for fda clearance for these systems and test cartridges and quality assurance costs 
the expenses primarily consisted of salaries  benefits  share based compensation costs  outside design and consulting services  laboratory supplies  contract research organizations  clinical study supplies and facility costs 
we expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred 
we expect research and development costs to increase as we develop our nexgen system and increase the development of new tests for our xt system 

table of contents general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses include expenses related to our executive  accounting and finance  information technology  legal  business development  human resource and investor relations departments 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  share based compensation costs  independent auditor costs  legal fees  consultants  travel  insurance  relocation  and public company expenses such as stock transfer agent fees and listing fees for nasdaq 
foreign exchange gains and losses transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the prevailing rates on the dates of the transaction 
foreign exchange gains and losses arise from differences in exchange rates during the period between the date a transaction denominated in a foreign currency is consummated and the date on which it is settled or translated 
prior to the initial public offering in  exchange gains and losses included those arising on cash balances held by osmetech denominated in currencies other than its functional currency  the british pound 
since the initial public offering  the functional currency of genmark has been the us dollar 
since the initial public offering  foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily related to a contract for intellectual property licensing that is denominated in euros 
interest income and interest expense interest income includes interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 
interest expense represents interest incurred on our loan payable and on other liabilities 
income tax provision benefit we account for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes 
under asc topic  deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
critical accounting polices and significant judgments and estimates revenue we recognize revenue from product sales and contract arrangements  net of discounts and sales related taxes 
we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
where applicable  all revenue is stated net of sales taxes and trade discounts 
we offer customers the choice to either purchase a system outright or to receive a system free of charge in exchange for an annual minimum purchase commitment for diagnostic test cartridges 

table of contents when a system is sold  revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the unit consistent with contract terms 
when a system is placed free of charge under a reagent rental agreement  we retain title to the equipment and the system remains capitalized on the balance sheet under property and equipment 
under our reagent rental agreements  our customers pay an additional system rental fee for each test cartridge purchased 
the system rental fee varies based on the monthly volume of test cartridges purchased 
the system rental fee and diagnostic test cartridges are recognized as contingent rental payments and are included in product revenue in our consolidated financial statements 
we sell our durable systems and disposable test cartridges primarily through a direct sales force in the united states 
components are individually priced and can be purchased separately or together 
the system price is not dependent upon the purchase of any amount of disposable test cartridges 
revenue on system and test cartridge sales is generally recognized upon shipment consistent with contract terms  which is when title and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer and there are no other post shipment obligations 
revenue related to royalties received from licenses is generally recognized evenly over the contractual period to which the license relates 
revenue from service agreements is recognized using the proportional performance method of accounting 
shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in sales and marketing expense 
in those cases where we bill shipping and handling costs to customers  the amounts billed are classified as revenue 
property and equipment net property  equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the assets estimated useful lives  which are noted below 
we generally capitalize our xt systems  and provide these to customers for no charge 
each category of property and equipment is analyzed to determine its useful life 
we look at the manufacturers estimates of useful life and adjust these for actual experience in our operating environment 
useful lives are reviewed periodically and shortened if circumstances dictate a change 
machinery and laboratory equipment years instruments years office equipment years leasehold improvements over the shorter period of the life of the lease or the useful economic life of the asset during  our estimate of the useful life of our systems was changed from five years to three years 
this estimate was revised due to a change in our strategy to accelerate the development of our next generation system and did not have a significant impact on the results for the period 
maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we assess the recoverability of long lived assets  including intangible assets and systems at customer locations by periodically evaluating the carrying value of such assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if impairment is indicated  we write down the carrying value of the asset to the estimated fair value 
in the years ended december  and  no impairment charges were recorded 
in the year ended december   we recorded impairment against systems of  which was recorded within cost of sales  sales and marketing  and research and development 
share based compensation we have granted our options with an exercise price equal to the closing price of genmark s common stock on the nasdaq global market on each grant date 
we use the black scholes option pricing model as the method for determining the estimated fair value of stock options 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share based awards  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
these assumptions include expected term 
our expected term represents the period that our share based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined by evaluating past experience and using other estimating tools 
expected volatility 
expected volatility represents the volatility in our stock price expected over the expected term of the option 
expected dividend 
the black scholes option pricing model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input 
we assumed no dividends as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to do so 
risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes option pricing model is based on published government rates in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of option 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and the united kingdom 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in recognition of this risk  we have provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets relating to our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
if our assumptions change and we determine we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets  the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at december  will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense 

table of contents changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc topic and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this pronouncement clarifies the application of certain existing fair value measurement guidance and expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs 
this pronouncement is effective on a prospective basis for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after december  this standard affects required disclosures only so is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income and in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
these pronouncements address changes to the financial statement presentation of comprehensive income and the timing of implementation of these changes 
the standards do not affect the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
these standards are required to be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  these standards change required financial statement presentation so are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

table of contents in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement with square bank  pursuant to which we obtained a credit facility consisting of a revolving line of credit in the amount of up to million and an equipment term loan in the amount of up to million 
based upon certain financial covenants  interest on the revolving line of credit will be either i the greater of a the bank s prime rate as of september  plus  or b  or ii the greater of a the bank s prime rate plus  or b 
in addition  based upon certain financial covenants  interest on the equipment term loan will be either i the greater of a the bank s prime rate plus  or b  or ii the greater of a the bank s prime rate plus  or b 
the revolving line matures in july and the term loan matures in july in march  the loan and security agreement was amended  whereby the line of credit availability was increased to million and the maturity was extended to july the term loan was modified to allow invoices up to days to qualify to be submitted for credit extension 
there were no other changes to these two loans 
in march  an additional loan was made available under the amended loan and security agreement for up to million to finance equipment purchases 
based upon certain financial covenants  interest on this equipment term loan will be either i the greater of a the bank s prime rate plus  or b  or ii the greater of a the bank s prime rate plus  or b 
this term loan matures march as of december   the company had no outstanding loans on the line of credit or the equipment loan and had a balance of million used to finance equipment purchases and tenant improvements to its carlsbad facility on the original equipment term loan 
the loan bears an interest rate of

in addition  the loan and security agreement includes several restrictive covenants  including requirements that we obtain the consent of square bank prior to entering into any change of control event unless all debt is repaid to square bank prior to the change of control event  incurring other indebtedness or liens with respect to our property  making distributions to our stockholders  making certain investments or entering into certain transactions with affiliates and other restrictions on storing inventory and equipment with third parties 
the agreement also limits the amount we can borrow under the term loan to license genetic biomarkers to  to secure the credit facility  we granted square bank a first priority security interest in our assets and intellectual property rights and provided a  standby letter of credit 
we are currently in compliance will all ratios and covenants 
the company s management has prepared cash flow forecasts which indicate  based on the current cash resources available  the availability of unutilized credit facilities  and our ability to access the equity markets  that we will have sufficient resources to fund our business for at least the next months 
we expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we grow our customer base and revenues  expand our research and 
table of contents development  commercialization and manufacturing activities 
the amount of additional capital we may need to raise in the future depends on many factors  including the level of revenues and the rate of revenue growth  the level of expenses required to expand our sales and marketing activities  the level of research and development investment required to maintain and improve our technology  our need to acquire or license complementary technologies or acquire complementary businesses  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and changes in regulatory policies or laws that affect our operations 
we cannot be certain that additional capital will be available when and as needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated 
if we require additional capital at a time when investment in diagnostics companies or in the marketplace in general is limited due to the then prevailing market or other conditions  we may not be able to raise such funds at the time that we desire  on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted  and these newly issued securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
if we obtain additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations and place encumbrances on our assets 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or products  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us
