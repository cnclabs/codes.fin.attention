legislative changes in item business of this annual report on form k for information regarding legislative and regulatory changes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our historical experience  contract terms  observance of known trends in our company and the industry as a whole and information available from other outside sources 
our estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those initial estimates 
our most significant estimates relate to the valuation of property and equipment  receivables  goodwill and other intangible assets  which may be significantly affected by changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate  and to the aggregate costs for self insured liability and workers compensation claims 
additionally  estimates are used for determining income tax liabilities 

table of contents we review the carrying values of goodwill at least annually during the first quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing whether goodwill is impaired  the fair value of the related reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized equal to such excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as when determining the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
we consider our slots gaming rights and trademark intangible assets as indefinite lived intangible assets that do not require amortization based on our future expectations to operate our gaming facilities indefinitely  as well as our historical experience in renewing these intangible assets at minimal cost with various state gaming commissions 
rather  these intangible assets are tested annually  or more frequently  if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the slots gaming rights and trademark intangible assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
we assign estimated useful lives to our definite lived intangible assets based on the period of time the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows 
we consider certain factors when assigning useful lives such as legal  regulatory  competition and other economic factors 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized using the straight line method 
while we believe that our estimates of future revenues and cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions could materially affect our assessment of useful lives and fair values 
changes in assumptions may cause modifications to our estimates for amortization or impairment  thereby impacting our results of operations 
if the estimated lives of our definite lived intangible assets were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above  amortization expense could increase significantly 
during  we intend to adopt fasb asu  intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment  which permits an entity to qualitatively assess whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
we do not expect this adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our business can be impacted positively and negatively by legislative and regulatory changes  by economic conditions and by gaming competition 
a significant negative impact from these activities could result in a significant impairment of our property and equipment and or our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
additional information regarding how our business can be impacted by competition and legislative changes is included in subheading j 
competition and subheading k 
legislative changes  respectively  in item business of this annual report on form k 
in connection with losses incurred from natural disasters  insurance proceeds are collected on existing business interruption and property and casualty insurance policies 
when losses are sustained in one period and the amounts to be recovered are collected in a subsequent period  management uses estimates and judgment to determine the amounts that are probable of recovery under such policies 
estimated losses  net of anticipated insurance recoveries  are recognized in the period the natural disaster occurs and the amount of the loss is determinable 
insurance recoveries in excess of estimated losses are recognized when realizable 

table of contents we also use estimates and judgments for financial reporting to determine our current tax liability  as well as those taxes deferred until future periods 
net deferred and accrued income taxes represent significant assets and liabilities of the company 
in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes  we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
adjustments to deferred taxes are determined based upon changes in differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities  measured by enacted tax rates we estimate will be applicable when these differences are expected to reverse 
changes in current tax laws  enacted tax rates or the estimated level of taxable income or non deductible expenses could change the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and affect the overall effective tax rate and tax provision 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable that we have deemed to have a high risk of uncollectibility 
we analyze historical collection trends and customer creditworthiness when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
any changes in our assumptions or estimates could impact our bad debt expense and results of operations 
in  our business insurance renewals included substantially the same coverage and retentions as in previous years 
we estimate insurance liabilities for workers compensation and general liability losses based on our historical loss experience  certain actuarial assumptions of loss development factors and current industry trends 
any changes in our assumptions  actuarial assumptions or loss experience could impact our total insurance cost and overall results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in
