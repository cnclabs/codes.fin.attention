table of contents part i item business 
overview electromed  inc we  us  electromed or the company was incorporated in minnesota in in august  we completed an initial public offering and our common stock is traded on the nyse mkt under the ticker symbol elmd 
electromed manufactures  markets and sells products that provide airway clearance therapy  including the smartvest airway clearance system smartvest system and related products  to patients with compromised pulmonary function 
the smartvest system generates high frequency chest wall oscillation hfcwo  also known as high frequency chest compression  a technique for airway clearance therapy 
hfcwo facilitates airway clearance by loosening and mobilizing respiratory secretions in a patient s lungs 
a vest is worn over the torso that repeatedly compresses and releases the chest at frequencies from to cycles per second 
each compression or oscillation produces pulsations within the lungs that shear secretions from the surfaces of the airways and propels them toward the mouth where they can be removed by normal coughing 
unlike traditional chest physiotherapy  which must be performed on the patient while he or she is placed in a series of often uncomfortable positions  hfcwo can be performed with the patient sitting upright 
studies show that hfcwo therapy is as effective an airway clearance method for patients who have cystic fibrosis or other forms of compromised pulmonary function as traditional chest physiotherapy administered by a respiratory therapist 
however  hfcwo can be self administered  relieving a caregiver of participation in the therapy  and eliminating the attendant cost of an in home care provider 
we believe the treatments are cost effective primarily because they reduce a patient s risk of respiratory infections and other secondary complications that are associated with impaired mucus transport 
secondary complications  such as pneumonia  may be serious or life threatening and often result in costly hospital visits 
in addition  the smartvest system is extremely comfortable  which promotes patient compliance  leading to improved airway clearance and enhanced respiratory function 
the smartvest system is a portable  programmable  and multi positional airway clearance machine that generates hfcwo and has been cleared by the food and drug administration fda to promote airway clearance and improve bronchial drainage 
consequently  it may be prescribed to patients suffering from diseases such as cystic fibrosis  bronchiectasis  muscular dystrophy  post surgical airway complications and a variety of other diseases and conditions associated with impaired lung and airway capacity 
by clearing airways  patients are able to rid their lungs of retained secretions and are therefore less likely to develop lung infections such as pneumonia 
the smartvest system features a programmable electro mechanical air pulse generator and therapy garment  which together provide safe  comfortable  and effective airway clearance therapy 
we believe that the lightweight  portable design allows patients greater freedom to travel and enjoy activities of daily living  resulting in enhanced quality of life for patients 
a broad range of vest and wrap sizes for children and adults allow for tailored fit and function 
user friendly controls allow children to administer their own daily therapy under adult supervision 
our goal has been to make the hfcwo airway clearance treatments as comfortable and convenient as possible so our patients can more easily tolerate their regimen and be able to perform their treatments as readily as possible 
personnel in order to maintain and expand our position in the market for airway clearance therapy products  we have assembled an experienced team of employees with expertise in health care  product development  manufacturing  marketing  sales  and financial management 
for example  approximately of our employees are respiratory therapists 
in addition  we engage more than respiratory therapists and health professionals on a non exclusive independent contractor basis to educate and train customers on the smartvest system 

table of contents our management team has significant business experience and has developed industry relationships  resulting from memberships in various respiratory care professional groups and attendance  sponsorship and participation in numerous medical conferences in the us  europe  and asia 
in may  robert d 
hansen retired as chairman and chief executive officer of electromed  inc the board of directors appointed dr 
james j 
cassidy  chief operating officer  as interim chief executive officer 
in addition to relationships developed at the management level  our staff and contractors  who often play a key role in the education of current and potential customers  have developed trusted relationships across the us with physicians and other caregivers over the course of their careers 
approximately of our full time employees  including our entire patient services department and approximately half of our sales representatives  are respiratory therapists 
many of these individuals have extensive experience in the field of respiratory care  and their relationships and experience are of great value to the company 
these individuals maintain a dialogue with clinics  patients  patient families  and respiratory therapist trainers to ensure that our products are being properly operated and are performing effectively 
additionally  our sales representatives participate in various events  such as family days held by the cystic fibrosis foundation for cystic fibrosis patients  at which they have an opportunity to demonstrate the effectiveness of the smartvest system and further develop relationships with patients  patient families  physicians and hospitals 
in order to ensure the efficient production of high quality products  we employ experienced personnel in our engineering  manufacturing  and quality assurance departments and work with an established network of vendors 
our products our products are primarily used in the home health care market 
we also sell our products for use in hospitals  which we refer to as institutional sales 
accordingly  our points of contact are home health care  hospitals  clinics  and pulmonary rehabilitation centers  both domestically and internationally 
the smartvest system must be prescribed by a physician and  depending on the circumstances of the patient  the cost is generally reimbursable by medicare  medicaid  private insurance  or a combination of the three 
we have received clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states  and the products are also registered in certain countries overseas 
the smartvest system the smartvest system consists of a therapy garment  a programmable electro mechanical air pulse generator for creating and controlling force pulses  and a single hose which extends the force pulses from the generator to the therapy garment 
the smartvest system is a portable airway clearance therapy system that gives the patient direct control over the most difficult and time consuming aspects of respiratory therapy  and provides caregivers an easier and more reproducible means of administering therapy to disabled or bedridden patients 
the smartvest system also has other appealing practical features including improved ease of use and a non clinical appearance 
we believe these attributes particularly appeal to children  teenagers and young adults and their parents 
our system allows the patient to be relatively mobile while therapy is being given  unlike manual chest physical therapy in which the patient must remain in a fixed position 

table of contents the smartvest therapy garment offers the following features design we have pioneered vest and wrap garment designs that provide consistent and controlled pulse pressure that is distributed throughout the vest and treats the entire front and back of the chest cavity 
the smartvest garments are low profile  featuring a soft  breathable fabric 
some competitive models have reduced the weight and size of their vests by reducing coverage area of the chest and applying pressure to the chest only 
we do not endorse or employ a partial coverage vest  and all of our products offer degree coverage 
our smartvest garment uses a flow through system design  which can prevent lags in pulse pressure accommodation as compared to a closed loop system  in which electronic signal generators must continuously send changes in air fill instruction to the air pump 
we believe patient comfort is improved as a result of our flow through design 
size and ease of use the smartvest garment is available in eight sizes to accommodate children and adults 
the simple design of the velcro and overlap closure system creates a broad size adjustment range to insure a properly tailored fit 
it also makes the smartvest garments easier to clean and disinfect than some competitors products  which often use straps and buckles 
the patented design includes a removable bladder  permitting the garment to be easily washed and dried 
this feature also helps improve infection control efforts 
material an attractive washable acrylic shell with quick fit velcro provides an appealing non clinical look and feel  which we believe enhances self esteem and patient compliance 
the smartvest system s electronic air pulse generator features the following important aspects portable design the air pulse generator for the smartvest system is streamlined and fits into a roller bag for easy transport 
our product s garment and hose are carried in a small companion bag 
the unit is relatively lightweight and can be readily carried or rolled by an individual 
the system complies with airline carry on size limits and can be carried onto an airplane or stowed in the trunk of a car  allowing patients greater freedom to travel 
single hose system when the smartvest system is in use  a single hose delivers the pulsation to the smartvest garment  which we believe provides therapy in a more comfortable and unobtrusive manner than a two hose system 
in addition to facilitating patient comfort  the single hose system provides effective treatment by simplifying delivery of the air pulse energy to the lungs 
the pulse is delivered evenly from the base of the smartvest therapy garment  extending the force pulses upward and inward in strong but smooth cycles surrounding the chest  which delivers simultaneous treatment to all lobes of the lungs 
programmable pulse generation the smartvest system uses an air pulse generator with an internal programmable memory feature to generate a pneumatic pulse 
the pulse frequency can be adjusted from to cycles per second  which accommodates the required therapeutic range 
the range can be preset with programmable controls  in order to assure patient safety and specific treatment requirements 
for example  the unit can be programmed to deliver a varying pulse frequency during the course of a treatment session without requiring manually directed changes 
we believe this feature adds convenience and enhances patient compliance with treatment protocol choices 
power supply the smartvest system also includes a power supply suitable for use in international markets  such that voltage and amperage are accommodated automatically 
other products we market the single patient use spu smartvest and smartvest wrap to health care providers  particularly those working in intensive care units 
hospitals issue the spu smartvest or smartvest wrap to an individual patient for the duration of his or her stay 
both products facilitate continuity of care because they introduce the patient to our product line and may encourage use of the smartvest system for home care  which can be provided to patients with a chronic condition upon discharge 
both products provide full coverage pulsation 
the spu smartvest is a full sized vest that is often used for patients undergoing institutional treatment who are already accustomed to using a smartvest system 
the spu smartvest is intended for short term  in patient use and allows the patient to avoid contaminating his or her home use vest while continuing treatment in a hospital or other facility 

table of contents the smartvest wrap is lightweight  convenient  and well suited for patients recovering from surgery and short term illnesses 
we believe that the design of the smartvest wrap makes it easy for the health care professional to operate because it does not need to go over the patient s shoulders  minimizing the need to move post surgical patients and avoiding interference with other devices the patient may be using 
in addition  the smartvest wrap is reversible  which allows the air pulse generator to be aligned on either side of a hospital bed 
we believe that our ability to provide a more comfortable therapy alternative to patients results in a higher likelihood of patient cooperation and consistent use 
we have designed and patented a mobile pedestal  which we manufacture and provide with sales of our institutional models of the smartvest system 
the mobile pedestal allows for easy transport within the medical facility 
this unit includes a pneumatic feature  permitting ease of movement in raising and lowering the vertical position of the generator 
our markets we market our hfcwo products to a broad patient population 
for patients with a chronic pulmonary condition  many hours per day may be dedicated to a variety of treatments 
the smartvest system provides effective airway clearance therapy in a comfortable and portable design which allows patients greater independence and speed of treatment 
building from a foundation of product quality  as well as our dedication to customer service  our goal is to be a consistent innovator in providing airway clearance therapy to patients with compromised pulmonary function 
because sale of the smartvest system is by physician s prescription only  we market to health care professionals  such as doctors  nurses  respiratory therapists  case managers  and clinic coordinators 
however  with respect to both our in home and institutional products  the health care professionals decisions may be based on preferences expressed by patients 
therefore  we believe that it is also important to market our products to patients and caregivers 
in addition  because the availability of reimbursement is an important consideration for health care professionals and patients  we must also demonstrate the effectiveness of our product to public and private insurance providers 
the smartvest system is currently prescribed to patients who suffer from cystic fibrosis cf  bronchiectasis  neuro muscular disorders or post surgical complications and patients who are ventilator dependent or have other conditions involving excess secretion and impaired mucus transport 
when we entered the market in  we focused on providing our product to cf patients because we felt those individuals could greatly benefit from treatment from our hfcwo system and it was the indication most likely to qualify for reimbursement at that time 
over time  we have expanded our focus to include post surgical and intensive care patients at risk of developing pneumonia  patients with end stage neuromuscular disease  and ventilator dependent patients 
the essential requirements that make a patient a candidate for airway clearance therapy are compromised respiratory function with a need to maintain and or improve pulmonary status  mobilize secretions several times per day  and carry out activities of daily living 
the smartvest system is designed to meet the individual patient s needs by providing hfcwo therapy that is effective  efficient  easy to administer  and can be performed independently 
electromed s established marketing and product support services provide education  training  and follow up with the patient population to insure the product is integrated into their daily treatment regimen 
we believe advantages of the smartvest system to the independent patient include 
table of contents eligibility for reimbursement by private insurance  by federal or state government programs or combinations of the foregoing  consistent treatments at home  independence from a dedicated caregiver  portability  improved comfort during therapy  and improved self image 
marketing  sales and distribution during our fiscal year  we experienced significant turnover in our sales team and downward pressure on reimbursement 
throughout the year  we worked to enhance our domestic sales team 
we believe these efforts adversely impacted our revenue growth 
we expect to achieve future sales and earnings growth through aggressive sales and marketing  bringing more value to our customers  and reviewing opportunities to expand our product line 
we participate in medical conferences and maintain industry contacts in order to increase the visibility of our products and acceptance by physicians and health care professionals  as well as patients 
in addition  we place advertisements in leading medical magazines and journals in the us and europe 
we will also be revising our internet web site to make it more targeted and user friendly  this will be of significant value to our patients  clinicians  and payers 
the company has recently hired a new directory of marketing  gary sullivan 
mr 
sullivan comes to us with more than years of sales marketing management experience in fortune companies  mid caps  and start up organizations in the fields of medical devices  diagnostics  and pharmaceuticals 
his background includes domestic as well as international markets 
north american marketing in the united states  electromed sells its products through a network of direct sales representatives 
each representative  or clinical area manager cam  is responsible for introducing our products  principally the smartvest system  to clinics and hospitals within a specific geographical area  and providing continued support to customers 
as of june   we had total sales representatives  including three regional sales managers and cams 
collectively  our sales force covers the entire united states  which we have divided into west  midwest  and east regions 
each cam is assigned to a territory within one of the three regions 
we have also developed a network of more than respiratory therapists and health care professionals to assist with training patients across the us on a non exclusive independent contractor basis 
we believe that the professional knowledge of the cams and trainers demonstrates our commitment to customer satisfaction and facilitates sales 
electromed has also hired a new director of sales responsible for our worldwide sales effort 
william kalb brings a record of accomplishment in more than twenty years of medical sales management and business development 
mr 
kalb will focus his efforts on growing sales revenue in the domestic market and overseeing our international distributor network 
international marketing in fiscal  our international sales comprised approximately of net revenue 
internationally  electromed sells through independent distributors specializing in respiratory products 
each distributor operates in an exclusive territory 
our principal distributors are located in the arab states of the persian gulf  europe  and japan 
units are sold at a consistent price with payment made directly from the distributor  rather than allowing payments consistent with reimbursement as is the case for domestic sales 
we continue to identify distributors in attractive markets for the smartvest system 

table of contents competition hfcwo was first developed for cf patients at the university of minnesota 
the purpose of hfcwo is to provide more effective mucus clearance in a form that could be performed independently of a caregiver 
the original technology was licensed to american biosystems  inc now advanced respiratory  inc 
ari  part of hill rom holdings  inc which  until the introduction of our original medpulse respiratory vest system in  was the only manufacturer of this technology 
all of ari s products use a two hose  closed loop system  in contrast to the single hose  flow through system that the smartvest system uses  which we believe provides greater ease of use and patient comfort 
in  respiratory technologies  inc  a privately held company doing business as respirtech  received fda clearance to market their incourage system the incourage system  which includes a hfcwo vest 
like the smartvest system  ari s the vest and respirtech s incourage system are cleared for market by the fda 
from a clinical performance perspective  all hfcwo products meet a common standard of substantial equivalence 
as a result  product features and benefits  size  weight of the generator  reputation for patient services  and sales effectiveness of field personnel have become key variables 
we believe that the product features of the smartvest system enable us to compete effectively  particularly when health care professionals  patients  and caregivers are provided with demonstrations of product choices prior to committing to a specific product 
we often provide demonstration units to encourage such comparisons 
unlike our competitors products  the smartvest system has a single hose  flow through system design and an adjustable vest garment made from soft  breathable and washable fabric 
we use velcro in our patented vest to provide a tailored fit  as opposed to an inflatable fit model 
in addition to product features  our focus on providing exemplary customer training and service  along with our commitment to engage and retain highly motivated employees and contractors  many of whom are medical professionals  provides what we believe to be a valuable competitive advantage 
alternative products for administering pulmonary therapy include positive expiratory pressure pep mask eg  pari pep s  pari respiratory equipment  inc which provides backpressure into the lungs on expiration to keep respiratory tracts open longer to drain  the flutter axcan scandipharm inc  a tube which vibrates on expiration  acapella vibratory pep therapy system smiths medical  a handheld device that combines pep with oscillations  intrapulmonary percussive ventilation device eg  hc impulsator  percussionaire corporation  generally comprised of a ventilator that combines positive air pressure with nebulisation as appropriate  and traditional chest physical therapy cpt  which is usually performed one to four times per day 
physicians may prescribe some or all of these devices and techniques  depending upon each patient s health status  severity of disease  compliance  or personal preference 
we believe our primary competitive advantage over alternative treatments is patient comfort  ease of use  and the effectiveness of hfcwo treatment as compared to cpt and other alternative treatments 
because hfcwo is not technique dependent  as compared to most other pulmonary therapy products  therapy begins automatically once power is provided and remains consistent and controlled for the duration of the session 
we strive to make the smartvest system an increasingly attractive and comfortable form of hfcwo therapy 
we believe that hfcwo therapy generally  and the smartvest system in particular  produces less interference with daily activities  which increases the likelihood of regular use 
we believe these advantages encourage physicians to prescribe and patients to request the smartvest system for pulmonary therapy 
reimbursement for the diverse patient populations for each of these pulmonary therapies varies greatly because a patient s medical care costs are typically addressed by a combination of private insurance and government benefit schedules  as well as state health care policies and programs 

table of contents research and development as of june   our research and development staff consisted of two full time employee engineers and several consultants 
we also have received engineering support pursuant to an agreement with hansen engine corporation  an entity in which mr 
craig n 
hansen  a director of the company  serves as vice president of research and development and a director  mr 
robert d 
hansen  former chairman and chief executive officer of the company  serves as chairman and chief executive officer  and thomas m 
hagedorn  a director of the company  serves as a director 
see part iii  item  certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence 
our team  the majority of whom have experience in respiratory therapy and medical device development  has a demonstrated record of developing new products which receive the appropriate product approvals and regulatory clearances  with our products having been approved or cleared in the us  canada  japan and the member countries of the european union 
during the fiscal years ended june  and  we incurred research and development expenses of approximately  and  respectively 
as a result of our expected investments in enhancing the smartvest system  we intend to spend at least of net revenue on research and development activities for the foreseeable future 
intellectual property as of june   we held issued us patents and foreign patents covering the smartvest system and its underlying technology  and had pending us and foreign patent applications 
these patents and patent applications offer coverage in the field of air pressure pulse delivery to a human in support of airway clearance 
our first us patent expires in and our first canadian patent in we generally pursue patent protection for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices in foreign countries in which we have identified as key markets for our products 
these markets include the european union  canada  japan  and other countries 
we have also received the following us trademark and service mark registrations medpulse  medpulse respiratory vest system  smartvest  smartvest wrap  smartwrap  fact  soft start  trimline  and creating superior care through innovation 
manufacturing our headquarters in new prague  minnesota includes a dedicated manufacturing and engineering facility of more than  square feet 
our site has been regularly audited by the fda  in accordance with fda practices  and we maintain our operations in a manner consistent with fda requirements for a medical device manufacturer 
our manufacturing processes emphasize simplicity  cost effectiveness  and a capacity to realize increases in production volume with escalation in demand 
all employees are responsible for maintaining specific manufacturing and quality standards  which are monitored by our quality assurance department and certified on an annual basis to be compliant with iso and iso quality system standards 
our staff is responsible for manufacturing each smartvest system 
while components are outsourced to meet our detailed specifications  each smartvest system is assembled  tested  and approved for final shipment at our manufacturing site in new prague  minnesota  consistent with fda  underwriters laboratory ul  and iso standards 
while all third party vendors present some degree of risk  many of our vendors are located within miles of our headquarters  which enables us to closely monitor the supply chain 
we maintain an adequate supply of all of our critical components to meet demand 

table of contents seasonality our business is not materially affected by seasonality 
product warranties we provide a warranty on the smartvest system that covers the cost of replacement parts and labor  or a new smartvest system in the event we determine a full replacement is necessary 
for home care smartvest systems initially purchased and currently located in the united states and canada  we provide a lifetime warranty to the individual patient for whom the system is prescribed 
for products sold to patients in greece  we provide a five year warranty 
for sales to institutions within the united states and canada  and for all other sales to individuals and institutions made outside of the united states  canada and greece  we provide a three year warranty 
our warranties provide that if a newer model of our systems has been developed and sold between the time of purchase of the original system and we determine the need for replacement  we may replace the system with a newer model in our sole discretion 
third party reimbursement in the us  individuals who use the smartvest system will generally rely on third party payers  including private payers and governmental payers such as medicare and medicaid  to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of using the smartvest system 
reimbursement for hfcwo therapy and the smartvest system varies among public and private insurance providers 
most patients are able to qualify for reimbursement and payment from medicare  medicaid  private insurance or combinations of the foregoing 
we expect that subsequent generations of hfcwo products will also qualify for reimbursement under medicare plan b and most major health plans 
however  some third party payers must also approve coverage for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use the medical devices or therapies 
in addition  we face the risk that new or modified products could have a lower reimbursement rate  or that the levels of reimbursement currently available for our existing products could decrease  which would hamper our ability to market and sell that product 
consequently  our sales will continue to depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party payers  even though our devices may have been cleared for commercial distribution by the fda 
the manner in which reimbursement is sought and obtained varies based upon the type of payer involved and the setting in which the procedure is furnished 
the nature of any future legislation is uncertain  making it difficult for us to predict the impact of cost containment trends on operating results 
a key element in our customer support strategy has been achieved by establishing an effective reimbursement department to seek insurance authorization and process claims on behalf of the patient 
the skill and knowledge gained and offered by our reimbursement department is an important factor in building our revenue and serving patients financial interests 
our payment terms generally allow patients to acquire the smartvest system over a period of to months  which is consistent with reimbursement procedures followed by medicare and other third parties 
the amount we receive for any single unit is based on reimbursement schedules and may vary based on a number of factors  including medicare and third party reimbursement processes and policies 
the patient maintains the risk of reimbursement to the company in the event of non payment by third party payers 
payments for overseas sales are made directly by the distributors  and we are not involved in the reimbursement process 
international sales were approximately and of our net revenue during fiscal years and  respectively 

table of contents governmental regulation medicare and medicaid recent government and private sector initiatives in the us and foreign countries are aimed to limit the growth of health care costs  including price regulation  competitive pricing  coverage and payment policies  comparative effectiveness of therapies  technology assessments  and managed care arrangements  and are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost effective medical devices 
government programs  including medicare and medicaid  have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments  restricting coverage for certain products or services  and implementing other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs 
in addition  many private insurance programs look to medicare as a guideline in setting their coverage policies and payment amounts 
this has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers 
product regulations our medical devices are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies  including the fda and comparable foreign agencies 
to varying degrees  each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development  testing  manufacturing  labeling  marketing  and distribution of our medical devices 
since inception  management has retained the necessary clinical  medical and legal expertise to support required clearances and approvals to market our products 
our regulatory and quality assurance departments provide detailed oversight of their areas of responsibility 
we have received clearance from the fda to market our products  including the smartvest system  as a powered percussor 
we obtained iso and iso certification in january  which demonstrates that our products conform to uniform standards for manufacturing quality and that our business meets certain professional standards 
in addition  we obtained clearance to use the european union ce mark on our products in april the ce mark is required for medical device sales in countries within the european economic area  which includes the member countries of the european union as well as iceland  liechtenstein  norway  switzerland  turkey  and other european countries that may adopt eu standards voluntarily 
renewal of the ce mark is required every five years  and our notified body performs an annual audit to ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations 
we have maintained our ce mark in good standing since originally receiving it and most recently renewed it in january we also require all of our distributors to comply with their home country regulations 
fda requirements if we develop new medical devices or modifications to existing products that would affect the product s safety or effectiveness  we may be required to obtain fda clearance before marketing the new or modified product in the us  either through the k clearance process or the more complex premarket approval process 
the process may be time consuming and expensive  particularly if clinical trials are required 
failure to obtain such clearances or approvals could adversely affect our ability to grow our business 
delays in receipt or failure to receive clearances or approvals  the loss of previously received clearances or approvals  or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
continuing product regulation in addition to its approval processes for new products  the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of previously approved products that have been commercialized  and may prevent or limit further marketing of products based on the results of these post marketing programs 
at any time after approval of a product  the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with both the fda s quality system regulation qsr requirements and or current medical device reporting regulations 
product approvals by the fda can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 
the failure to comply with regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines  delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances  seizures or recalls of products with the attendant expenses  the banning of a particular device  an order to replace or refund the cost of any device previously manufactured or distributed  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution  as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims 

table of contents we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer and  as a result  we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda s qsr requirements  which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations  including testing  quality control and documentation procedures 
in addition  the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or  if a malfunction were to occur  could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda 
we are also required to maintain certain certifications in order to sell products internationally  and we undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications 
advertising and promotion of medical devices  in addition to being regulated by the fda  are also regulated by the federal trade commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities 
recently  promotional activities for fda regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under health care reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes 
competitors and others can also initiate litigation relating to advertising claims 
if the fda determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use  it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions  including the issuance of an untitled letter  a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine or criminal penalties 
it is also possible that other federal  state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use  which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities  such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement 
fraud and abuse laws federal health care laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under medicare  medicaid or other federally funded health care programs 
the principal federal laws include the false claims act  which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program  the anti kickback statute  which prohibits offers to pay or receive remuneration of any kind for the purpose of inducing or rewarding referrals of items or services reimbursable by a federal health care program  and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims with any third party payer 
there are often similar state false claims  anti kickback  and anti self referral and insurance laws that apply to state funded medicaid and other health care programs and private third party payers 
in addition  the us foreign corrupt practices act can be used to prosecute companies in the us for arrangements with physicians  or other parties outside the us if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country 
enforcement of all of these regulations has become increasingly stringent  particularly due to more prevalent use of the whistleblower provisions under the false claims act  which allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery 
if a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including substantial penalties  fines and damages  and exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by medicare or medicaid 

table of contents hipaa and other fraud and privacy regulations federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information  including patient records  and restrict the use and disclosure of such information 
in particular  the us department of health and human services has issued patient privacy and security standards for electronic health information under the health insurance portability and accountability act of and its implementing regulations hipaa 
the hipaa privacy and security standards govern the use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities  which are healthcare providers that submit electronic claims  health plans and healthcare clearinghouses 
because we provide our products directly to patients and bill third party payers such as medicare  medicaid  and insurance companies  we are a covered entity and must comply with these standards 
our compliance with certain provisions of these standards entails significant costs for us 
failure to comply with hipaa or any state or foreign laws regarding personal data protection may result in significant fines or penalties and or negative publicity 
in addition to federal regulations issued under hipaa  some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that  in some cases  are more stringent than those issued under hipaa 
in those cases  it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws 
if we fail to comply with applicable state laws and regulations  we could be subject to additional sanctions 
the hipaa health care fraud and false statement statutes also prohibit  among other things  knowingly and willfully executing  or attempting to execute  a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program  including private payers  and knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false  fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits  items or services 
environmental laws we are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the us like other medical device companies  our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws  primarily manufacturing and sterilization processes

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
the forward looking statements include statements that reflect management s beliefs  plans  objectives  goals  expectations  anticipations and intentions with respect to our future development plans  capital resources and requirements  results of operations  and future business performance 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements included in this discussion as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those discussed in the section entitled information regarding forward looking statements immediately preceding part i of this report 
overview electromed  inc we  us  electromed or the company was incorporated in we are engaged in the business of providing innovative airway clearance products applying high frequency chest wall oscillation hfcwo technologies in pulmonary care for patients of all ages 
we manufacture  market and sell products that provide hfcwo  including the smartvest airway clearance system smartvest system and related products  to patients with compromised pulmonary function 
our products are sold for both the home health care market and the institutional market for use by patients in hospitals  which we refer to as institutional sales 
for approximately twelve years  we have marketed the smartvest system and its predecessor products to patients suffering from cystic fibrosis  bronchiectasis and repeated episodes of pneumonia 
additionally  we offer our products to a patient population that includes post surgical and intensive care patients at risk of developing pneumonia  patients with end stage neuromuscular disease  and ventilator dependent patients 
because sale of the smartvest system is by a physician s prescription only  we market to physicians and health care providers as well as directly to patients 
in addition to distributors overseas  we have established our own domestic sales force  which we believe is able to provide superior support and training to our customers 
in addition  we have non exclusive independent contractor arrangements with more than respiratory therapists and health care professionals who also provide education and training to our customers 
further  although the reimbursement process is subject to many contingencies  the smartvest system is often eligible for reimbursement from major private insurance providers  hmos  state medicaid systems  and the federal medicare system  which is an important consideration for patients considering an hfcwo course of therapy 
for domestic sales  the smartvest system may be reimbursed under the medicare assigned billing code for high frequency chest wall oscillation devices if the patient has cystic fibrosis  bronchiectasis including chronic bronchitis or copd that has resulted in a diagnosis of bronchiectasis  or any one of certain enumerated neuro muscular diseases  and can demonstrate that another less expensive physical or mechanical treatment did not adequately mobilize retained secretions 
private payers consider a variety of sources  including medicare  as guidelines in setting their coverage policies and payment amounts 
we have been generating revenue from the sale of the smartvest system or its predecessor products since and have generated net income since the fiscal year ended june  for the fiscal year ended june   we generated revenue of approximately  and net income of approximately  our sales growth rate was for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year and was for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year 
net income as a percentage of sales was in compared to in management believes the deceleration in revenue growth was primarily due to turnover in our domestic sales force 
the decrease in net income was primarily due to retirement costs for two former officers of the company  recruitment costs associated with replacing sales representatives  and staffing increases for sales growth that did not materialize 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect reported amounts 
those estimates and assumptions affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and our reported revenues and expenses 
we update these estimates  assumptions and judgments as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we use our technical accounting knowledge  cumulative business experience  judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies 
while we believe the estimates  assumptions and judgments we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are appropriate  they are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome and therefore  actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
the following is a summary of our primary critical accounting policies and estimates 
please also refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  included in part ii  item of this report 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts revenues from direct patient sales are recorded at the amount to be received from patients under their arrangements with third party payers  including private insurers  prepaid health plans  medicare and medicaid 
in addition  we record an estimate for selling price adjustments that often arise from changes in a patient s insurance coverage  changes in a patient s state of domicile  insurance company coverage limitations or patient death 
we periodically review originally billed amounts and our collection history and make changes to the estimation process by considering any changes in recent collection or sales allowance experience  but have not made material adjustments to previously recorded revenues and receivables 
other than the installment sales as discussed below  we expect to receive payment on the vast majority of accounts receivable within one year and therefore classify all receivables as current assets 
however  in some instances  payment for direct patient sales can be delayed or interrupted resulting in a small portion of collections occurring later than one year 
in the event receivables are expected to be paid over longer intervals than one year  we recognize revenue under the installment method 
certain third party reimbursement agencies pay us on a monthly installment basis  which can span from to months in the cases of wisconsin  texas  and new york medicaid  which constitute the majority of our installment method sales 
due to the length of time over which reimbursement is received  we believe that the inherent uncertainty of collection due to external factors noted above precludes us from making a reasonable estimate of revenue at the time the product is shipped 
in certain circumstances  the patient must periodically attest that the unit continues to be utilized as a prerequisite to continued reimbursement coverage 
therefore  we believe the installment method is appropriate for these sales 
if the third party reimbursement agency discontinues payment and we determine no further payments will be made from the patient  the carrying value of the account receivable is written off as a period adjustment against the previously recognized sales 
under the installment method  we do not record accounts receivable or revenue at the time of product shipment 
we defer the revenue associated with the sale and  as each installment is received  that amount is recognized as revenue 
deferred costs associated with the sale are amortized to cost of revenue ratably over the estimated period in which collections are scheduled to occur 
accounts receivable are also net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  which are accounts from which payment is not expected to be received although product was provided and revenue was earned 
management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer s financial condition and credit history 
receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
we request that customers return previously sold units that are no longer in use to us in order to limit the possibility that such units would be resold by unauthorized parties or used by individuals without a prescription 
the customer is under no obligation to return the product  however  we do reclaim the majority of previously sold units upon the discontinuance of patient usage 
we have not obtained certification to recondition and resell returned units 
returned units are primarily used for warranty replacement parts and demonstration equipment 
returned products do not have significant value to us as the costs of becoming certified to resell  reclamation and reconditioning typically exceed the costs of producing a new unit 

table of contents valuation of long lived and intangible assets long lived assets  primarily property and equipment and finite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating recoverability  the following factors  among others  are considered a significant change in the circumstances used to determine the amortization period  an adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  a transition to a new product or service strategy  a significant change in customer base  and a realization of failed marketing efforts 
the recoverability of an asset is measured by a comparison of the unamortized balance of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows 
if we believe the unamortized balance is unrecoverable  we would recognize an impairment charge necessary to reduce the unamortized balance to the estimated fair value of the asset 
the amount of such impairment would be charged to operations at the time of determination 
property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
we use the straight line method for depreciating property and equipment over their estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
our finite life intangibles consist of patents and trademarks and their carrying costs include the original cost of obtaining the patents  periodic renewal fees  and other costs associated with maintaining and defending patent and trademark rights 
patents and trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives  generally and years  respectively  using the straight line method 
during the year ended june  we incurred legal defense costs associated with a trademark infringement lawsuit filed against us see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
such legal defense costs are being capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the trademark 
we expect future amortization expense to increase as we incur additional costs associated with our patents and trademarks 
allowance for excess and slow moving inventory an allowance for potentially slow moving or excess inventories is made based on our analysis of inventory levels on hand and comparing it to expected future production requirements  sales forecasts and current estimated market values 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine  based on the weight of available evidence  that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
warranty reserve we provide a lifetime warranty on products sold to patients in the united states and canada  a three year warranty for institutional sales within the united states and canada  a five year warranty on products sold to patients in greece  and a three year warranty on all other sales to individuals and institutions outside of the united states  canada and greece 
we estimate  based upon a review of historical warranty claim experience  the costs that may be incurred under our warranty policies and record a liability in the amount of such estimate at the time a product is sold 
the warranty cost is based upon future product performance and durability  and is estimated largely based upon historical experience 
we estimate the average useful life of our products to be approximately five years 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  the product s useful life  and cost per claim 
at our discretion  based upon the cost to either repair or replace a product  we have occasionally replaced such products covered under warranty with a new model 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and make adjustments to the accrual as claim data and historical experience warrant 

table of contents share based compensation share based payment awards consist of options issued to employees for services  and to non employees in lieu of cash payment for products or services 
expense is estimated using the black scholes pricing model at the date of grant and the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service or vesting period of the award 
in determining the fair value of our share based payment awards  we make various assumptions when using the black scholes pricing model  including expected risk free interest rate  stock price volatility  life and forfeitures 
please see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report for these assumptions
