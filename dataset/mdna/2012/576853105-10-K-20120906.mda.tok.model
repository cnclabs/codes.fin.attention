item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  contains a comprehensive summary of our significant accounting policies 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in our application of gaap 
critical accounting estimates revenue recognition matrix records profits on fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis  primarily based on costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated contract cost 
the company records revenue on reimbursable and time and material contracts on a proportional performance basis as costs are incurred 
contracts in process are valued at cost plus accrued profits less billings on uncompleted contracts 
contracts are generally considered substantially complete when field construction is completed 
the elapsed time from award of a contract to completion of performance may be in excess of one year 
matrix includes pass through revenue and costs on cost plus contracts  which are customer reimbursable materials  equipment and subcontractor costs  when matrix determines that it is responsible for the procurement and management of such cost components 
matrix has numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion which require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition 
the company has a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs  and accordingly  does not believe significant fluctuations are likely to materialize 
however  current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available 
if estimates of costs to complete fixed price contracts indicate a loss  a provision is made through a contract write down for the total loss anticipated 
a number of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that impact the earnings we realize from our contracts 
adjustments related to these incentives and penalties are recorded in the period on a percentage of completion basis when estimable and probable 
indirect costs  such as salaries and benefits  supplies and tools  equipment costs and insurance costs  are charged to projects based upon direct labor hours and overhead allocation rates per direct labor hour 
warranty costs are normally incurred prior to project completion and are charged to project costs as they are incurred 
warranty costs incurred subsequent to project completion were not material for the periods presented 
overhead allocation rates are established annually during the budgeting process and evaluated for accuracy throughout the year based upon actual direct labor hours and actual costs incurred 
claims recognition claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price that we seek to collect from customers or others for delays  errors in specifications and designs  contract terminations  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price or other causes of anticipated additional costs incurred by us 
recognition of amounts as additional contract revenue related to claims is appropriate only if it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and if the amount can be reliably estimated 
if all of the following requirements are met  revenue from a claim is recorded only to the extent that we have incurred costs relating to the claim 
we must determine if there is a legal basis for the claim  the additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen by the company and are not the result of deficiencies in our performance  the costs are identifiable or determinable and are reasonable in view of the work performed  and the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 

table of contents as of june  and june   costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenues for unapproved change orders of million and million  respectively 
there were no claims included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts as of june  or june  historically  our collections for unapproved change orders and other claims have approximated the amount of revenue recognized 
loss contingencies various legal actions  claims  and other contingencies arise in the normal course of our business 
contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements  or are otherwise disclosed  in accordance with asc  loss contingencies 
specific reserves are provided for loss contingencies to the extent we conclude that a loss is both probable and estimable 
we use a case by case evaluation of the underlying data and update our evaluation as further information becomes known 
we believe that any amounts exceeding our recorded accruals should not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
however  the results of litigation are inherently unpredictable and the possibility exists that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters could result in a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
legal costs are expensed as incurred 
insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations 
however  we retain exposure to potential losses through the use of deductibles  coverage limits and self insured retentions 
we establish reserves for claims using a combination of actuarially determined estimates and management judgment on a case by case basis and update our evaluations as further information becomes known 
judgments and assumptions  including the assumed losses for claims incurred but not reported  are inherent in our reserve accruals  as a result  changes in assumptions or claims experience could result in changes to these estimates in the future 
if actual results of claim settlements are different than the amounts estimated we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be significant 
a hypothetical ten percent unfavorable change in our claim reserves at june  would have reduced fiscal pretax income by million 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the acquisition date fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in accordance with current accounting guidance  goodwill is not amortized and is tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level 
as discussed in our form q for the quarter ending march   we previously concluded that the change in operating segments  which is discussed in note segment change and note segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report  requires that we change our reporting units based on the new segments 
goodwill was allocated to the new reporting units in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
the change in operating segments  reporting units and the subsequent allocation of goodwill to the new reporting units did not change the value of our underlying business  therefore  did not constitute an event that required us to perform an interim impairment test 
based on these factors  we continued our practice of performing the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first comparing management s estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a computation of the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with its related carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
significant judgments and assumptions including the discount rate  anticipated revenue growth rate and gross margins  estimated operating and interest expense  and capital expenditures are inherent in these fair value estimates  which are based on our operating and capital budgets and on our strategic plan 
as a result  actual results may differ from the estimates utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis 
the use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could result in a fair value that differs from our estimate and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the financial statements 
as a result of these uncertainties  we utilize multiple scenarios and assign probabilities to each of the scenarios in the discounted cash flow analysis 

table of contents although we do not anticipate a future impairment charge  certain events could occur that would adversely affect the reported value of goodwill 
such events could include  but are not limited to  a change in economic or competitive conditions  a significant change in the project plans of our customers  the economic condition of the customers and industries we serve  and a material negative change in the relationships with one or more of our significant customers 
if our judgments and assumptions change as a result of the occurrence of any of these events or other events that we do not currently anticipate  our expectations as to future results and our estimate of the implied value of one or more of our reporting units also may change 
we performed our annual impairment test based on the new reporting units in the fourth quarter to determine whether an impairment existed and to determine the amount of headroom at may  we define headroom as the percentage difference between the fair value of a reporting unit and its carrying value 
the amount of headroom varies by reporting unit 
approximately of our goodwill balance is attributable to one reporting unit 
this unit had headroom of at may  we have three additional reporting units with goodwill representing  and of the total goodwill balance with headroom of  and  respectively 
our significant assumptions  including revenue growth rates  gross margins  operating and interest expense and other factors  have been reasonably accurate in recent years  but may change in light of changes in the economic and competitive environment in which we operate 
assuming that all other components of our fair value estimate remain unchanged  a change in the following assumptions would have the following effect on headroom if the growth rate of estimated revenue decreases by one percentage point  the headroom of the reporting units referenced above would be reduced from   and to   and  respectively  if our estimate of gross margins decreases one percentage point  the headroom of the reporting units referenced above would be reduced from   and to   and  respectively  and if the applicable discount rate increases one percentage point  the headroom of the reporting units referenced above would be reduced from   and to   and  respectively 
recently issued accounting standards accounting standards update  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
asu amends asc  providing a consistent definition and measurement of fair value  as well as similar disclosure requirements between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles  clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement and expands the asc disclosure requirements  particularly for level fair value measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the company s adoption of asu did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
accounting standards update  comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income effective march   we adopted accounting standards update no 
 comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu eliminated the option of presenting the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity 
asu requires that comprehensive income be reported in either a single contiguous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections  net income and other comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
we elected to present comprehensive income in two statements 
the adoption of asu did not impact the company s financial position or results of operations  as it only required a change in the format of the current presentation 
accounting standards update  disclosures about an employer s participation in a multiemployer plan effective june   we adopted accounting standards update no 
 disclosures about an employer s participation in a multiemployer plan asu 
asu requires employers to make additional separate disclosures for multiemployer pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
additional disclosures include  but are not limited to the plans in which an employer participates  
table of contents the level of participation  including the plans to which the employer is a significant contributor  the financial health of significant plans  and the nature of the employer s commitment to the plans 
asu does not change the current recognition and measurement guidance that requires an employer to recognize its required contribution as a pension or other postretirement benefit cost for the period and to recognize a liability for any contributions due at the reporting date 
asu does not change the recognition  measurement or disclosure requirements for obligations related to an actual or potential withdrawal from a multiemployer plan 
these obligations continue to be accounted for under asc  contingencies 
under asc  if an obligation due to withdrawal from a multiemployer plan is probable and reasonably estimable  the recognition of a liability and disclosure of the contingency is required 
if an obligation due to withdrawal from a multiemployer plan is reasonably possible  disclosure of the contingency is required 
see note employee benefit plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report  for specific disclosures relating to the multiemployer pension plans that we consider material 
the adoption of asu did not impact the company s financial position or results of operations  as it only required additional disclosures regarding the company s participation in multiemployer plans 
results of operations overview during fiscal  the company completed an update of its long term business strategy 
this strategic update along with certain changes in our organizational structure led to a reassessment of our operating segments 
as a result of these events  we have revised our reportable segments to better align with the current management of the business 
our previous operating segments were construction services and repair and maintenance services 
our new segments are as follows the electrical infrastructure segment primarily encompasses high voltage services to investor owned utilities  including construction of new substations  upgrades of existing substations  short run transmission line installations  distribution upgrades and maintenance  and storm restoration services 
we also provide construction and maintenance services to a variety of power generation facilities such as combined cycle plants  nuclear facilities  coal fired power stations  and renewable energy installations 
the oil gas chemical segment includes our traditional turnaround activities  plant maintenance services and construction in the downstream petroleum industry 
another key offering is industrial cleaning services  which include hydroblasting  hydroexcavating  chemical cleaning  and vacuum services 
we also perform work in the renewable energy  industrial and natural gas  gas processing and compression  and upstream petroleum markets 
the storage solutions segment includes new construction of  as well as planned and emergency maintenance services for crude and refined products aboveground storage tanks 
also included in the storage solutions segment is work related to specialty storage tanks including liquefied natural gas lng  liquid nitrogen liquid oxygen lin lox  liquid petroleum lpg tanks and other specialty vessels including spheres 
finally  the storage solutions segment includes balance of plant work in storage terminals and tank farms 
the industrial segment includes work in the mining and minerals industry  bulk material handling  thermal vacuum chambers  as well as work for clients in other industrial and manufacturing markets 
the majority of the work for all segments is performed in the united states  with of revenues generated in canada during fiscal as compared to in fiscal significant period to period changes in revenues  gross profits and operating results are discussed below on a consolidated basis and for each segment

table of contents fiscal versus fiscal consolidated consolidated revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from consolidated revenues of million in fiscal the increase in consolidated revenues was a result of increases in storage solutions and oil gas chemical revenues  which increased million and million  respectively 
these increases in revenues were partially offset by lower electrical infrastructure and industrial revenues  which decreased million and million  respectively 
consolidated gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase of million was primarily due to higher revenues  partially offset by a decrease in gross margins from in fiscal to in fiscal consolidated sg a expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase of million  or  was primarily due to higher operating costs in fiscal related to increased business volumes  costs related to our investment in high growth areas of the business and related investment in support functions such as safety  marketing  corporate development  systems and training  and a non routine stock compensation charge  partially offset by lower legal costs 
sg a expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal net interest expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal other expense in fiscal was million and related primarily to foreign currency transaction losses 
fiscal had other income of million  which related primarily to foreign currency transaction gains 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the fiscal effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rate due to cumulative non deductible expenses totaling million related to deductibility limitations applying to certain items that had previously been fully deducted  of which million was related to prior fiscal years fiscal to fiscal and million was for the current fiscal year 
the fiscal effective tax rate was positively impacted by the release of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryovers of million 
electrical infrastructure revenues for the electrical infrastructure segment decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease of million  or  was primarily due to the completion of a cogeneration project in the prior year and unfavorable conditions in our east coast operations related to a decline in spending by electric utilities due to warm winter weather  the impact of low natural gas prices  as well as timing delays of various project start dates and contract awards 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal oil gas chemical revenues for the oil gas chemical segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase of million  or  was due to a significantly higher volume of turnaround work and a higher level of capital construction projects 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal storage solutions revenues for the storage solutions segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase of million  or  was due to higher levels of work both domestically outside of cushing and in canada in our core aboveground storage tank business and an increase in domestic tank farm and terminal balance of plant work 
gross margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the lower margins in fiscal were primarily due to geographic expansion  costs associated with unexpected warranty work  and isolated margin fades 
industrial revenues for the industrial segment decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease of million  or  was largely due to the timing of revenues on a single project in this project 
table of contents accounted for million of revenues in fiscal and million in fiscal gross margins decreased from in fiscal to in the current year 
gross margins in fiscal were negatively impacted by startup costs related to our entry into the bulk material handling and mining and minerals markets 
fiscal versus fiscal the company s fiscal results were affected by the following items non routine charges the california pay practices class action lawsuits we recorded a pretax charge of million in fiscal related to this matter 
the charge was recorded as an increase to cost of revenues with million allocated to the storage solutions segment and million to the oil gas chemical segment 
the charge is more fully discussed in note contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
this charge is referred to as the charge on a legal matter throughout our discussion of financial results in this item claims receivable write down we recorded pretax charges totaling million in fiscal caused by a write down of the value of claim receivables acquired in the february acquisition of sm electric company  inc sme 
of the charge  million was the result of the recorded value of a claim exceeding the arbitration award 
the remaining million charge related to a separate claim receivable and was recorded in conjunction with our on going assessment of the recoverability of the recorded value of the claim receivables 
these charges are collectively referred to as the claims receivable write off in our discussion of financial results in this item and were recorded as an increase to selling  general and administrative expenses 
this charge is more fully discussed in note customer contracts of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
claims receivable collection costs costs incurred to collect the claims acquired in the sme acquisition were higher than estimated and resulted in a pretax charge of million in fiscal and million in fiscal these charges are referred to as the claims receivable excess collection costs in our discussion of financial results in this item and were recorded as an increase to sg a expense 
these charges are more fully discussed in note customer contracts of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
significant loss on projects at june   estimated costs on a series of projects at a large complex in the gulf coast were in excess of previous estimates resulting in a pretax charge of million in fiscal the increased costs were primarily due to difficult working conditions at the site and poorly defined scopes of work  which led to inefficiencies  rework and cost overruns 
this charge was recorded as a reduction in gross profit in the oil gas chemical segment 
the charge is referred to as the loss on the projects at a gulf coast site throughout our discussion of financial results in this item consolidated consolidated revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from consolidated revenues of million in fiscal the increase in consolidated revenues was a result of increases in electrical infrastructure  storage solutions and industrial revenues  which had increases of million  million and million  respectively 
these increases in revenues were partially offset by lower oil gas chemical revenues which decreased million 
consolidated gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase of million was largely due to the effect of higher revenues combined with higher gross margins  which increased from in fiscal to in fiscal consolidated sg a expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the net decrease of million was primarily due to non routine charges incurred in fiscal including the claims receivable write off of million and higher claims receivable excess collection costs in fiscal  offset by higher legal and facility costs as well as higher incentive costs in fiscal resulting from better operating performance

table of contents other income in fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively  and related primarily to foreign currency transaction gains 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the fiscal effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate due to the benefit of state tax credits and a federal tax deduction for qualifying domestic construction activities 
electrical infrastructure revenues for the electrical infrastructure segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase of million  or  was primarily due to higher maintenance work from utilities in the northeastern united states 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to a year earlier 
fiscal had higher direct gross margins primarily due to higher margins on a single project that was completed in fiscal despite the absence of this high margin job in fiscal  we were able to maintain our gross margins by improving recovery of overhead costs due to higher business volume in fiscal oil gas chemical revenues for the oil gas chemical segment decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease of million  or  was primarily due to a lower level of capital construction projects 
gross margins increased from in fiscal to in fiscal fiscal gross margins were negatively affected by a loss of million on projects at a gulf coast site and a non routine charge on a legal matter of million

gross margins increased from in fiscal to in fiscal fiscal gross margins were negatively affected by a non routine charge on a legal matter of million 
industrial industrial segment revenues increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase of million  or  was primarily due to an increase in revenues related to material handling and thermal vacuum chamber work 
gross margins increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the improvement in gross margins in fiscal is primarily due to the favorable effect of the improved recovery of overhead costs caused by a higher business volume in fiscal non gaap financial measure ebitda is a supplemental  non gaap financial measure 
ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we have presented ebitda because it is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in similar businesses 
we believe that the line item on our consolidated statements of income entitled net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ebitda 
since ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  net earnings as an indicator of operating performance 
ebitda  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
in addition  this measure is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
as ebitda excludes certain financial information compared with net income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  users of this financial information should consider the type of events and transactions  which are excluded 
our non gaap performance measure  ebitda  has certain material limitations as follows it does not include interest expense 
because we have borrowed money to finance our operations  pay commitment fees to maintain our credit facility  and incur fees to issue letters of credit under the credit facility  interest expense is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations 
it does not include income taxes 
because the payment of income taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations  any measure that excludes income taxes has material limitations 

table of contents it does not include depreciation or amortization expense 
because we use capital and intangible assets to generate revenue  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our cost structure 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation or amortization expense has material limitations 
reconciliation of ebitda to net income in thousands twelve months ended june  june  june  net income interest expense provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda financial condition and liquidity overview we define liquidity as the ability to pay our liabilities as they become due  fund business operations and meet all monetary contractual obligations 
our primary sources of liquidity in fiscal were cash on hand at the beginning of the year  capacity under our senior revolving credit facility  and cash generated from operations 
cash on hand at june  totaled million and availability under the senior revolving credit facility totaled million  resulting in total liquidity of million 
we expect to fund our operations for the next twelve months through the use of cash generated from operations  existing cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility 
factors that routinely impact our short term liquidity and that may impact our long term liquidity include  but are not limited to changes in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of costs due to contract terms that determine the timing of billings to customers and the collection of those billings some cost plus and fixed price customer contracts are billed based on milestones which may require us to incur significant expenditures prior to collections from our customers 
time and material contracts are normally billed in arrears 
therefore  we are routinely required to carry these costs until they can be billed and collected 
some of our large construction projects may require significant retentions or security in the form of letters of credit 
other changes in working capital capital expenditures other factors that may impact both short and long term liquidity include acquisitions of new businesses strategic investments in new operations purchases of shares under our stock buyback program contract disputes or collection issues capacity constraints under our senior revolving credit facility and remaining in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreement we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which we may issue  from time to time  up to million of senior debt securities  subordinated debt securities  common stock  preferred stock and warrants 
this shelf gives us additional flexibility  when capital market conditions are favorable  to grow our business  finance acquisitions or to optimize our balance sheet in order to improve or maintain our financial flexibility 
we may also elect to issue term debt or increase the amount of our revolving credit facility 
we will continue to evaluate our working capital requirements and other factors to maintain sufficient liquidity 

table of contents cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended june  totaled million 
major components of cash flows from operating activities for the year ending june  are as follows net cash provided by operating activities in thousands net income non cash expenses deferred income tax cash effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities loss on disposition of property  plant and equipment other net cash provided by operating activities the cash effect of significant changes in operating assets and liabilities include the following the net change in the combined balances of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of costs and estimated earnings caused an increase in operating assets and liabilities and a decrease to cash of million in the twelve months ended june  this change was primarily attributable to our contracts requiring us to fund more work in fiscal while the fiscal project portfolio permitted a higher degree of advance billing 
accounts receivable increased by million 
the accounts receivable increase is due to a higher level of business 
the rate of cash collections and the overall aging of our accounts receivable remained within historical norms 
accounts payable increased by million 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in business activity in the fourth quarter of fiscal cash flows from investing activities investing activities used million of cash in the twelve months ended june  due to capital expenditures of million  partially offset by proceeds from asset dispositions of million and an acquisition related adjustment of million as discussed in note goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
capital expenditures were higher in fiscal due to investments related to the company s growth strategy and included million for the purchase of construction equipment  million for transportation equipment  million for office equipment and software and million for land and buildings 
cash flows from financing activities financing activities used million of cash in the twelve months ended june  primarily due to the purchase of  shares of common stock under the company s stock buyback program in the amount of million  the million payment of fees related to the expansion of our credit facility and million related to other treasury share purchases 
senior revolving credit facility on november   the company entered into the third amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement  by and among the company  jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  lender and issuing bank  and the other lenders party thereto  which replaces the second amended and restated credit agreement dated as of november   as previously amended 
the credit agreement provides for a five year senior secured revolving credit facility of million  which replaces the million senior secured revolving credit facility under the prior credit agreement 
the credit agreement may be used for working capital  issuance of letters of credit and other lawful corporate purposes 
the credit agreement includes the following covenants and borrowing limitations we are required to maintain a senior leverage ratio  as defined in the agreement  of less than to 

table of contents we will be required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the agreement  greater than or equal to to 
asset dispositions other than inventory and obsolete or unneeded equipment disposed of in the ordinary course of business are limited to million per month period 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at libor or an alternate base rate  plus in each case  an additional margin based on the senior leverage ratio 
the credit agreement includes additional margin ranges on alternate base rate loans between and and between and on libor based loans 
the credit agreement also permits us to borrow in canadian dollars with a sublimit of us million 
amounts borrowed in canadian dollars will bear interest either at the cdor rate  plus an additional margin based on the senior leverage ratio ranging from to  or at the canadian prime rate  plus an additional margin based on the senior leverage ratio ranging from to 
the cdor rate is equal to the sum of the annual rate of interest which is the rate determined as being the arithmetic average of the quotations of all institutions listed in respect of the relevant cdor interest period for canadian dollar denominated bankers acceptances  plus 
the canadian prime rate is equal to the greater of i the rate of interest per annum most recently announced or established by jpmorgan chase bank  na  toronto branch as its reference rate in effect on such day for determining interest rates for canadian dollar denominated commercial loans in canada and ii the cdor rate plus 
the unused revolving credit facility fee is between and based on the senior leverage ratio 
the credit agreement includes a senior leverage ratio covenant which provides that consolidated funded indebtedness may not exceed times consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  over the previous four quarters 
for the four quarters ended june   consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  was million 
accordingly  at june   consolidated funded indebtedness in excess of million would have violated the senior leverage ratio covenant 
dividend policy we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock  and the terms of our credit agreement limit the amount of cash dividends we can pay 
under our credit agreement  we may declare and pay dividends on our capital stock during any fiscal year up to an amount which  when added to all other dividends paid during such fiscal year  does not exceed of our cumulative net income for such fiscal year to such date 
while we currently do not intend to pay cash dividends  any future dividend payments will depend on our financial condition  capital requirements and earnings as well as other relevant factors 
treasury shares on february   our board of directors authorized a stock buyback program that allows the company to purchase up to  shares of common stock provided that such purchases do not exceed million in any calendar year commencing in calendar year and continuing through calendar year in fiscal  the company purchased  shares under this program at an average price of 
these shares were returned to treasury 
we may purchase an additional  shares through the end of calendar if such purchases do not exceed million for the calendar year  and if sufficient liquidity exists and the company believes that it is in the best interest of the stockholders 
in addition to any stock buyback program that may be in effect  the company may withhold shares of common stock to satisfy the tax withholding obligations upon vesting of an employee s deferred shares 
matrix withheld  shares in fiscal to satisfy these obligations 
these shares were returned to the company s pool of treasury shares 
the company has  treasury shares as of june  and intends to utilize these treasury shares solely in connection with equity awards under the company s stock incentive plans 

table of contents commitments and off balance sheet arrangements as of june   the following commitments and off balance sheet arrangements were in place to support our ordinary course obligations commitments by expiration period less than year years years more than years total in thousands letters of credit surety bonds total all letters of credit issued under our credit facility are in support of our workers compensation insurance programs or certain construction contracts 
the letters of credit that support our workers compensation programs are expected to renew annually through the term of the credit facility  therefore  they are reported in the same period that the credit facility expires 
the letters of credit that support construction contracts will expire when the related work is completed and the warranty period has passed  therefore  these letters of credit are reported in the period that we expect the warranty period to end 
contractual obligations at june  are summarized below contractual obligations by expiration period less than year years years more than years total in thousands operating leases acquisition payable capital lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations the acquisition of edc  inc included an asset purchase agreement that requires an additional earnout payment as soon as practical after a measurement period if certain financial targets are achieved 
for additional information  see note acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item we enter into purchase commitments in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our requirements for materials and supplies under contracts that we have been awarded 
the commitments  which are generally recoverable from our clients  are short term and are generally settled in less than one year 
we do not enter into long term purchase obligations on a speculative basis for fixed or minimum quantities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest rate risk results primarily from our variable rate indebtedness under our senior credit facility  which is influenced by movements in short term rates 
borrowings under our million revolving credit facility are based on an alternate base rate  libor  cdor or canadian prime rate as elected by the company plus an additional margin based on our senior leverage ratio 
although there were no amounts outstanding under the facility at june   we sometimes borrow against our revolving credit line to fund short term working capital needs  and we may borrow in the future 
financial instruments with interest rate risk at june  were as follows maturity by fiscal year fair value as of june  total in thousands long term debt variable rate debt there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility at june  at the company s option  amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility in us dollars will bear interest at libor or an alternate base 
table of contents rate  plus in each case  an additional margin based on the senior leverage ratio 
we may also borrow up to million in canadian dollars at the cdor rate or the canadian prime rate plus an additional margin based on the senior leverage ratio
