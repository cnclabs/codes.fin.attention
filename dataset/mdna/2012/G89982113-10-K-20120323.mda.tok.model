table of contents foreign currency risk we are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our operations in foreign countries 
the assets  liabilities and results of operations of our foreign operations are measured using the functional currency of such foreign operation 
the functional currency for each of our corporate entities in turkey  bulgaria and romania is the local currency 
the functional currency for transatlantic petroleum ltd 
is the us dollar 
as a result  translation adjustments will result from the process of translating the functional currency of our subsidiary financial statements into the us dollar reporting currency 
our currency exposures primarily relate to the new turkish lira  as our largest subsidiaries measure their assets  liabilities and results of operations using the new turkish lira 
such translation adjustments accumulate on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as foreign currency translation adjustments 
as of december  and december   we had a million loss and a million gain  respectively  in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a result of translation adjustments 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded losses of million and of million  respectively  of foreign currency translation adjustments 
we are also subject to foreign currency exposures as a result of our operations in the other foreign countries in which we operate and foreign currency fluctuations as oil prices received are referenced in us dollar denominated prices 
we record foreign exchange gain loss on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a component of other expense income for gains and losses which result from re measuring transactions and monetary accounts into the functional currency in earnings 
for and  we recorded a foreign exchange loss of million and a foreign exchange loss of million  respectively 
as of december   we had million new turkish lira approximately million in cash and cash equivalents that are remeasured into the functional currency using the period end exchange rate  with such re measurement gains or losses recorded in foreign exchange gain loss 
we estimate that a change in the exchange rates would impact such cash balances and our net loss by approximately million 
we have not used foreign currency forward contracts to manage exchange rate fluctuations 
commodity price risk our revenues are derived from the sale of oil and natural gas 
the prices for oil and natural gas are extremely volatile and sometimes experience large fluctuations as a result of relatively small changes in supplies  weather conditions  economic conditions and government actions 
pursuant to our amended and restated credit facility  at least one of the borrowers is required to maintain commodity derivative contracts with standard bank and bnp paribas 
in december  temi entered into costless derivative contracts with standard bank and bnp paribas  which hedge the price of oil during and in april  temi entered into three way collar contracts and additional costless derivative contracts with standard bank and bnp paribas  which hedge the price of oil during and in may  temi entered into additional three way collar contracts with standard bank and bnp paribas  which hedge the price of oil during  and in august  temi entered into additional three way collar contracts with standard bank and bnp paribas  which hedge the price of oil during and in november  temi entered into additional three way collar contracts with standard bank and bnp paribas  which hedge the price of oil during   and pursuant to our amended and restated credit facility  we cannot enter into hedge agreements that  when aggregated with any other hydrocarbon hedge agreement then in effect  covers notional volumes in excess of of the reasonably projected production volumes attributable to our proved developed reserves 
the derivative contracts economically hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future oil production 
while the use of the hedging arrangements will limit the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future gains from favorable movements 

table of contents the costless collars provide us with a lower limit floor price and an upper limit ceiling price on the hedged volumes 
the floor price represents the lowest price we will receive for the hedged volumes while the ceiling price represents the highest price we will receive for the hedged volumes 
the costless collars are settled monthly 
these contracts may or may not involve payment or receipt of cash at inception  depending on the ceiling and floor pricing 
the three way collar contracts consist of a purchased put  a sold call and a purchased call 
the purchased put establishes a lower limit floor price  the sold call establishes an upper limit ceiling price and the purchased call establishes a second floor price on the hedged volumes 
the three way collar contracts require our counterparty to pay us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price 
we are required to pay our counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling price but below the second floor price  and our counterparty is required to pay us if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the second floor price 
neither party is required to make a payment to the other party if the settlement price for any settlement period is equal to or greater than the floor price and equal to or less than the ceiling price 
the three way collar contracts are settled monthly 
we have elected not to designate our derivative financial instruments as hedges for accounting purposes  and accordingly  we record such contracts at fair value and recognize changes in such fair value in current earnings as they occur 
our commodity derivative contracts are carried at their fair value in earnings as they occur 
we recognize unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts on a mark to market basis in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss under the caption loss on commodity derivative contracts 
settlements of derivative contracts are included in operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
if commodity prices decrease  this commodity price change could have a positive impact to our earnings 
conversely  if commodity prices increase  this commodity price change could have a negative effect on our earnings 
each derivative contract is evaluated separately to determine its own fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net unrealized loss on commodity derivative contracts of million 
we recorded a net unrealized loss on commodity derivative contracts of million in the following tables summarize our outstanding derivatives contracts with respect to future crude oil production as of december  type period quantity bbl day weighted average minimum price per bbl weighted average maximum price per bbl estimated fair value of asset liability in thousands collar january  december  collar january  december  collar january  december
