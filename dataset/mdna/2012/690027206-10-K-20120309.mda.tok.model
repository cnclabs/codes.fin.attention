the liquidity and capital resources section provides a discussion of our cash flows for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  overview and strategy outdoor channel holdings  inc is an entertainment and media company 
based on changes in how we monitor and measure our various businesses  we have determined that our aerial camera units  skycam and cablecam  should now be reported together as a separate segment 
accordingly  prior period segment information for production services has been revised to retroactively reflect aerial cameras as a separate segment and production services now includes solely our winnercomm results for all periods discussed in this item each of these operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges 
an overview of our three operating segments follows 
our core business  toc  is engaged in the development  production and broadcast of traditional outdoor programming such as hunting  fishing  shooting and off road motor sports 
with hunting season being in the second half of the calendar year  the success of our hunting programming during this same time has been the main driver of our stronger financial performance in the second half of the year 
we continue to broaden our programming offerings in the first half of the year in an attempt to improve our financial performance during that same period 
as such  we expanded our fishing programming in with notable fishing programs like bassmasters  madfin shark series  spanish fly and zona 
in addition  we announced a joint venture  major league fishing  with of the top anglers in the united states to provide us with opportunities to bolster this type of programming beginning in march overall  in addition to increasing revenue opportunities in the first half of the year  we believe this strategy will generate growth in our revenue from improving our program viewership ratings and increasing our distribution 
our production services segment  which is made up entirely of our winnercomm production entity  is closely aligned with our core focus on outdoor programming  but it also produces scripted and live event sports television and provides website services to other third parties 
our aerial cameras segment  which we acquired along with the purchase of winnercomm in  is the dominant us leader in overhead aerial camera production  and we believe it is a unique asset which has meaningful growth opportunities and is increasing in value 
it is a capital intensive business  and in order to accelerate its growth  we may seek a strategic partnership for this business in the future 
additional information regarding each segment follows 
outdoor channel outdoor channel is a national television network devoted primarily to traditional outdoor activities  such as hunting  fishing and shooting sports  as well as off road motor sports and other outdoor related lifestyle programming 
toc revenues consist primarily of advertising fees  including those from advertisements aired on outdoor channel and fees paid by third party producers to purchase advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs on outdoor channel  and subscriber fees paid by cable  satellite and telephone company service providers that air outdoor channel 
our advertising revenue for toc consists of advertising bought on our cable network and advertising revenue related to ads placed on our website  outdoorchannel 
com 
advertising revenues are generally driven by audience delivery  which in turn are determined by our subscriber base and the ratings our programs achieve in those homes 
a portion of toc s advertising contracts  primarily those with national non endemic advertisers  may guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience for its advertisements over the term of the contracts 
this requires us to make estimates of the audience size that will be delivered throughout the terms of the contracts at the time we enter into such contracts 
we base our estimate of audience size on our nielsen ratings from prior years 
if after running the advertising we determine we did not deliver the guaranteed audience  an accrual for make good advertisements is recorded as a reduction of revenue  and we then provide the advertiser with additional advertising time to reach the aggregate minimum audience that we guaranteed and then recognize such revenue at that time 
any estimated make good accrual is adjusted throughout the terms of the advertising contracts 
the continued growth of our advertising revenues will  to a certain extent  be dependent on the growth of our audience viewing and subscriber base  as well as the general health of the advertising marketplace 
for december  nielsen estimated that outdoor channel had million subscriber homes compared to million for the same period a year ago 
nielsen revises its estimate of the number of subscribers to our channel each month and there is usually a lag of months before nielsen captures any new launches or tier migrations 
for march nielsen s estimate increased to million subscribers  which we believe relates to the lag in their picking up new outdoor channel subscribers in their estimates 
nielsen is the leading provider of television audience measurement and advertising information services worldwide  and its estimates and methodology are generally accepted and used in the advertising industry 
our march nielsen estimate of million subscribers is the highest toc has ever achieved 
the estimate regarding outdoor channel s subscriber base is made by nielsen media research and is theirs alone  and does not represent our opinions  forecasts or predictions 
it should not be implied that we endorse nor necessarily concur with such information  simply due to our reference to or distribution of their estimate 
there can be no assurances that there will be any correlation between the actual growth or decline in our paying subscribers compared to nielsen s estimate of such growth or decline 
we continue to pursue subscriber growth by utilizing various incentives  including offering lower per subscriber fees for broader distribution  payment of subscriber acquisition or launch support fees and committing toc marketing dollars among other tactics 
any subscriber acquisition or launch support fees are capitalized and amortized over the period that the pay television distributor is required to carry the newly acquired toc subscriber 
to the extent revenue is associated with the incremental subscribers  the amortization is charged to offset the related revenue 
any excess of launch support amortization over the related subscriber fee revenue is charged to expense as other direct costs 
during the third quarter of  we gained approximately million subscribers through carriage upgrades in the chicago and new england marketplaces 
in december  we gained approximately  subscribers through a carriage upgrade in greater washington dc marketplace 
due to penetration discounts  we do not expect a significant increase in subscriber fees from these systems 
we expect to increase our marketing spend in to support these and other anticipated launches and migrations 
while we are programmed in high definition format hd  our hd signal is only carried on a subset of our overall subscriber base 
we currently have approximately million hd subscriber homes  all of which are on cable or telephone systems 
we are continuing our efforts to increase the carriage of our hd signal as we deem this to be an important competitive feature 
we increased our programming expenditures in and expect to continue to see increases in programming costs as we believe we need to invest in our programming brand given the increased viewing alternatives  including competitors with similar outdoor themed programming 
and while our advertising and marketing expense declined slightly in compared to  we expect to increase our expenses in this area in and beyond to support our increased programming investment and our recent and expected continued growth in subscribers 
while we believe these investments in programming and marketing will help assure our long term growth  they may have a dampening effect on toc s operating income in the near term 
we also have invested significant resources to build our outdoorchannel 
com website and expect that we will continue to make investments in this area to support material revenue potential for our online operations 
production services production services is comprised solely of our wholly owned subsidiary  winnercomm  inc  which is involved in the production  development and marketing of sports programming 
production services revenues include revenues from sponsorship  sales representation fees on television advertising sold on behalf of client advertisers  revenues from production services for customer owned telecasts  and revenue from website design  management  marketing and hosting fees 
since our acquisition of winnercomm in january  we have been focused on eliminating winnercomm s low margin production and non strategic business and returning the segment to profitability 
this has resulted in a material reduction of the segment s revenues and gross margins  which we believe will begin to level in our winnercomm unit is increasingly being used to produce high quality programming for toc 
during the fourth quarter of our winnercomm business moved into new facilities in tulsa which are expected to reduce their expenses beginning in via reduced office space and reduced lease rates 
we also terminated a key sales executive and reduced the chairman s compensation package during which will meaningfully reduce costs in aerial cameras our aerial cameras segment is comprised of our skycam and cablecam entities  which were acquired in connection with our winnercomm acquisition in january these entities are engaged in providing aerial camera services for customer owned telecasts 
most of the segment s revenues relate to professional and college football  but we also provide services  although to a much lesser extent  for other sports such as baseball  soccer and hockey and for special events such as concerts 
in the third quarter of  we consolidated our separate facilities for skycam in tulsa  ok and for cablecam in chatsworth  ca to a combined facility in ft 
worth  tx 
although we recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of this year related to exiting the tulsa skycam lease  which expires in  our new combined facility will provide us with more cost effective rent and more efficient staffing  which will benefit and beyond 
another important event for our aerial cameras segment was our receipt of favorable jury verdicts on all of our legal actions against actioncam and its founder  a competitor to our aerial camera business which we initiated suit against in for misappropriation of trade secrets  breach of separation agreement and unfair competition 
while we will likely incur additional costs pursuing final judgment in that case  we believe our legal expense going forward will be significantly less than in the past two years 
given the reduced actioncam related legal fees and reduced rent resulting from facility moves in  we expect to see significantly reduced expenses at our aerial cameras segment in we also hope to expand our business to other areas outside of football  and sports in general 
seasonality all of our segments generate a higher proportion of their revenue and operating income in the second half of our fiscal year due to higher viewed hunting programming which coincides with the fall hunting season at toc  hunting and sports related programming at our production services segment and to football driven revenues at our aerial cameras segment 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition toc generates revenue through advertising fees from advertisements and infomercials aired on outdoor channel  fees paid by outside producers to purchase advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs on outdoor channel and from subscriber fees paid by cable and satellite service providers that air outdoor channel 
advertising revenues are recognized when the advertisement is aired and the collectability of fees is reasonably assured 
subscriber fees are recognized in the period the programming is aired by the distributor 
production services revenue includes revenue from sponsorship and advertising fees from ad inventory  revenue from production services for customer owned telecasts  revenue from aerial camera services for customer owned telecasts and revenue from website design  management  marketing and hosting fees 
advertising revenues are recognized when the advertisement is aired and the collectability of fees is reasonably assured 
revenue from production services for customer owned telecasts is recognized upon completion and delivery of the telecast to the customer 
costs incurred prior to completion and delivery are reflected as programming and production costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
advances of payments prior to completion and delivery are shown as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenue from aerial camera services for customer owned telecasts is recognized upon completion and delivery of the telecast to the customer 
revenue from each event is based on an agreed upon contracted amount plus allowed expenses 
revenue from website design  management  marketing and hosting services is recognized upon the completion of services 
commission revenue from the marketing of program advertising  and commercial air time is recognized when the advertising or commercial air time occurs 
in the normal course of business  we act as or use an intermediary or agent in executing transactions with third parties 
certain transactions are recorded on a gross or net basis depending on whether we are acting as the principal in a transaction or acting as an agent in the transaction 
we serve as the principal in transactions in which we have substantial risks and rewards of ownership and  accordingly  record revenue on a gross basis 
for those transactions in which we do not have substantial risks and rewards of ownership  we are considered an agent in the transaction and  accordingly  record revenue on a net basis 
we record revenue when our commission is earned 
broadcast and national television network advertising contracts may guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience for its advertisements over the term of the contracts 
we provide the advertiser with additional advertising time if we do not deliver the guaranteed audience size 
the amount of additional advertising time is generally based upon the percentage of shortfall in audience size 
this requires us to make estimates of the audience size that will be delivered throughout the terms of the contracts 
we base our estimate of audience size on information provided by ratings services and our historical experience 
if we determine we will not deliver the guaranteed audience or have not yet delivered the additional advertising time  an accrual for make good advertisements is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
the estimated make good accrual is adjusted throughout the duration of the advertising contracts 
revenues recognized do not exceed the total of the cash payments received and cash received in excess of revenue earned is recorded as deferred revenue 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may arise if any of our customers are unable to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes the age of customer balances  historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness and trade publications regarding the financial health of our larger customers and changes in customer payment terms when making estimates of the uncollectability of our trade accounts receivable balances 
if we determine that the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorated or improved  whether due to customer specific or general economic conditions  we make appropriate adjustments to the allowance 
all of our bad debt expense is included in selling  general and administrative expense 
valuation of goodwill we currently have three reporting units  toc  production services and aerial cameras 
the production services reporting unit consists solely of our winnercomm business and the aerial cameras reporting unit consists of our cablecam and skycam businesses which were acquired on january  all of our goodwill is attributed to our toc reporting unit 
we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we typically perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit with goodwill to its carrying value 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds the carrying values of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to our reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
in september  the fasb issued guidance that simplified how entities test for goodwill impairment 
this guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a two step goodwill impairment test 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   and early adoption is permitted 
we early adopted this guidance for our annual goodwill impairment test that was conducted in the fourth quarter of the adoption of this guidance did not have any effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
no impairment losses were recorded on goodwill during the years ended december   or programming costs we produce a portion of the programming we air on our channel in house and through work for hire arrangements and amortize the related costs of production on a straight line basis over the expected airings of the produced shows 
we also have work in progress for uncompleted production projects 
at any given time  we have unamortized costs for programming that are carried on our balance sheet as programming and production costs 
these unamortized costs will be charged to programming expense when the related programs air and the related advertising revenue is recognized 
at the time it is determined that a program will not likely air  we charge to programming expense any remaining unamortized costs recorded in programming costs 
share based compensation we record stock compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including restricted stock  restricted stock units  performance units and stock options  for which expense is recognized over the service period  based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
we account for stock options granted to non employees using the fair value method 
compensation expense for options granted to non employees has been determined as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
compensation expense for options granted to non employees is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest and is recorded as expense in the consolidated financial statements 
we have not issued any new stock options during the three year period ended december  and have instead granted restricted stock and restricted stock units to certain of our employees and to most of our board of directors 
during and  we had performance units previously granted to our former chief executive officer  roger werner  expire unexercised 
in addition  in  we had significant amounts of stock options expire unexercised 
upon the expiration of these performance units and stock options  we reversed previously established deferred tax assets which resulted in deferred income tax expense of  and  in and  respectively 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record net deferred income tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets that do not meet the criteria for recognition 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized initially and in subsequent periods 
we have experienced a materially higher income tax expense in  and than would be expected based on a statutory income tax rate due to the expiration of unexercised stock options and performance units and to a lesser extent  due to deduction limits related officer compensation 
we expect that certain deferred income tax assets relating to outstanding stock options at december  that expire in and will  if unexercised  will generate deferred tax expense in those years of approximately  and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard update related to fair value measurements and disclosures to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with united states gaap and international financial reporting standards 
this guidance includes amendments that clarify the intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements  while other amendments change a principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
specifically  the guidance requires additional disclosures for fair value measurements that are based on significant unobservable inputs 
the updated guidance is to be applied prospectively and is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning january  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june and december  the fasb issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in equity  which is our current presentation  and also requires presentation of reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december   with the exception of the requirement to present reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements  which has been deferred pending further deliberation by the fasb  and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations  though it will change our financial statement presentation 
in september  the fasb issued an accounting standard update to simplify the annual goodwill impairment test 
the guidance provides companies with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value  the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary 
the qualitative assessment is optional  allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative assessment 
this guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we have adopted the new guidance for the annual period ended december  and it had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results of operations our consolidated results of operations are presented below for the years ended december  and comparison of consolidated operating results for the years ended december  and december  the following table discloses certain financial information for the periods presented  expressed in terms of dollars  dollar change  percentage change and as a percent of total revenue all dollar amounts are in thousands change of total revenue revenues advertising subscriber fees production services total revenues cost of services programming satellite transmission fees production and operations other direct costs total cost of services change of total revenue other expenses advertising selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total other expenses income from operations interest and other income  net income from operations before income taxes income tax provision net income percentages may not add due to rounding revenues total revenues for were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to revenues of million for the decrease was due primarily to lower production services revenue  partially offset by an increase in our subscriber fee revenue  as discussed further in our segment results of operations below

other expenses advertising expenses for were million  a decrease compared to million for the decrease was due to a shift in our marketing efforts from media buys to more targeted and cost effective social network outlets 
we expect this cost to increase substantially in as we plan to spend more aggressively to support our current and new programming and expanded distribution markets

depreciation and amortization expense for was million  a decrease compared to depreciation and amortization expense of million for the decrease primarily relates to more assets having become fully depreciated partially offset by depreciation on assets acquired in that same period 
income from operations income from operations for was million  an increase of million  compared to million for as discussed below in our segment results of operations  the increase in our income from operations for compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by an increase in subscriber fee revenues  reduced sg a at both toc and our production services unit  partially offset by increases in programming expense 
as a percentage of revenues  our income from operations was for compared to for due primarily to aforementioned reasons and a lower proportion of our overall revenue being contributed by our lower margin production services unit 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net for was  a decrease of  compared to  for the decrease was principally the result of lower interest rates on invested cash and investments

the effective income tax rate was approximately for both and certain performance units that were granted to our chief executive officer in along with other previously granted stock options expired unissued in october  which resulted in a decrease of million to our deferred tax assets and a corresponding increase to income tax expense 
our remaining unexercised stock options at december  will expire in and and if they are not exercised  we will record deferred income tax expense in those years of approximately  and  respectively 
we expect our effective tax rate to be closer to a normal rate 
net income our resulting net income for was million compared to net income of million for segment results of operations transactions between reportable segments are accounted for as third party arrangements for the purposes of presenting reporting segment results of operations below 
typical intersegment transactions include the purchase by our toc segment of programs to air on outdoor channel and website design  management and maintenance services from our production services segment 
our aerial cameras segment has no intersegment transactions between our toc or production services segments

cost of services programming expenses for were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for this increase was due primarily to write downs of programming costs related to our decision not to air certain shows beyond  along with the expensing of development costs related to major league fishing  a new programming venture  and to new  more expensive programs airing during the current year periods compared to the prior year periods

as of december   we held million of auction rate securities ars classified as long term assets 
auction rate securities are investment vehicles with long term or perpetual maturities which pay interest monthly at current market rates reset through a dutch auction 
beginning in february  the majority of auctions for these types of securities failed due to liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets 
our auction rate securities followed this trend and experienced multiple failed auctions due to insufficient investor demand 
as there is a limited secondary market for auction rate securities  we have been unable to convert our positions to cash 
we do not anticipate being in a position to liquidate all of these investments until there is a successful auction or the security issuer redeems their security  and accordingly  have reflected our investments in auction rate securities as non current assets on our balance sheet 
due to these liquidity issues  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these investments 
the assumptions used in preparing the models include  but are not limited to  interest rate yield curves for similar securities  market rates of returns  and the expected term of each security 
based on these models  we recorded an unrealized gain on our ars of in as a result of the lack of liquidity in the ars market  we have an unrealized loss on our ars of  which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we deemed the loss to be temporary because we do not plan to sell any of the ars prior to maturity at an amount below the original purchase value and  at this time  do not deem it probable that we will receive less than of the principal and accrued interest 
in making assumptions of required rates of return  we considered risk free interest rates and credit spreads for investments of similar credit quality 
our ars investments continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  are fully collateralized by underlying financial instruments primarily closed end preferred and municipalities and have maintained at least a credit ratings despite the failure of the auction process 
we believe that based on our current cash  cash equivalents and investments in available for sale securities balances at december   the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity  cash flow  financial flexibility or our ability to fund our operations 
we continue to monitor the market for ars and consider its impact if any on the fair value of our investments 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in fair values does not occur  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
cash used by financing activities was million for both and the cash used by financing activities relates to a special million dividend 
per common share declared and paid in december and another special one time million dividend declared and paid in december  in addition to the purchase and retirement of treasury stock as employees used stock to satisfy withholding taxes related to the vesting of restricted shares  and the purchase of stock in in connection with the stock repurchase plan which terminated that year 
on august   the board of directors approved the renewal of the revolving line of credit agreement the revolver with us bank na  extending the maturity date to september  and renewing the total amount which can be drawn upon under the revolver to  the revolver provides that the interest rate per annum as selected by us shall be prime rate and as of december  and  respectively plus or libor and as of december  and  respectively plus 
the revolver is unsecured 
this credit facility contains customary financial and other covenants and restrictions  as amended  including a change of control provision and minimum liquidity metrics 
as of december   we did not have any amounts outstanding under this credit facility and we were in compliance with all the revolver covenants 
this revolver is guaranteed by toc 
while we declared special dividends in december and  there are no current plans to declare such a dividend in however  our board of directors continues to regularly assess our need for cash and liquidity and if they determine in the future that we have excess cash compared to our projected operating and or growth needs  another special dividend might be declared 
as of december   we had sufficient cash on hand and expected cash flow from operations to meet our short term cash flow requirements 
management believes that our existing cash resources  including cash on hand and anticipated cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations at current levels and anticipated capital requirements through at least december  to the extent that such amounts are insufficient to finance our working capital requirements or our desire to expand operations beyond current levels  we could seek additional financing 
there can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available if needed or  if available  will be on terms favorable to us 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations purchase obligations employment agreements total operating lease obligations principally relate to satellite lease commitments for delivery of our signal and office leases 
purchase obligations relate to purchase commitments made for the acquisition of programming  advertising and promotions  including magazine advertisements  talent agreements  equipment or software maintenance  ratings and research services and other operating purchases 
employment agreements represent our obligations to our chief executive officer  chief operating officer and general counsel  chief financial officer  and chief accounting officer under their employment agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december  and  our investment portfolio included auction rate securities of  and  respectively  with long term maturities 
the interest rates on these securities adjust monthly which somewhat mitigates any interest rate risk 
however  due to the amount of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates in these securities would have no material impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time may increase our interest expense 
we currently do not have significant transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars and as a result we currently have no foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign exchange rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
as of december  and as of the date of this report  we did not have any outstanding borrowings 
the rate of interest on our line of credit is variable  but we currently have no outstanding balance under this credit facility 
because of these reasons  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material  immediate impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows
