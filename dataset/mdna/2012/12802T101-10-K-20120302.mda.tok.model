we incur routine drydock  inspection  maintenance and repair costs pursuant to us coast guard regulations and in order to maintain our vessels in class under the rules of the applicable class society 
for  these costs were million 
we defer these costs and amortize them over the period commencing with the date the vessel returned to service following completion of the drydock and certification process to the next certificate expiry date  which typically ranges from months to months 
these costs can fluctuate widely from year to year based on the number of vessels  the scope of the related work plan  availability of drydock capacity and general prevailing market conditions 
in addition to complying with these requirements  we have our own vessel maintenance program that we believe permits us to continue to provide our customers with well maintained  reliable vessels 
in addition to the deferred drydock costs discussed above  during  we incurred million in capital expenditures primarily related to replacements and vessel improvements 
in the normal course of business  we charter other vessels on a short term basis  such as tugboats  cargo barges  utility boats and dive support vessels

item legal proceedings insurance and legal proceedings our operations are subject to the inherent risks of offshore marine activity  including accidents resulting in personal injury and the loss of life or property  environmental mishaps  mechanical failures  fires and collisions 
we insure against these risks at levels consistent with industry standards 
we also carry workers compensation  maritime employer s liability  general liability and other insurance customary in our business 
all insurance is carried at levels of coverage and deductibles we consider financially prudent 
our services are provided in hazardous environments where accidents involving catastrophic damage or loss of life could occur  and litigation arising from such events may result in our being named a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims 
although there can be no assurance the amounts of insurance we carry are sufficient to protect us fully in all events  or that such insurance will continue to be available at current levels of cost or coverage  we believe that our insurance protection is adequate for our business operations 
a successful liability claim for which we are underinsured or uninsured could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we are involved in various legal proceedings  primarily involving claims for personal injury under the general maritime laws of the united states and the jones act as a result of alleged negligence 
in addition  we from time to time incur other claims  such as contract disputes  in the normal course of business 
although these matters have the potential of significant additional liability  we believe the outcome of all such matters and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
tax assessment during the fourth quarter of  horizon received a tax assessment related to fiscal from the servicio de administracion tributaria or sat  the mexican taxing authority  for approximately million pesos  including penalties and interest accrued through that date us million  including penalties and interest  and adjusted for inflation using the foreign exchange rate at december  the sat s assessment claims unpaid taxes related to services performed among our subsidiaries as well as penalties and accrued interest 
after consulting with our mexican counsel  we believed that under the mexico and united states double taxation treaty these services are not taxable and the tax assessment itself is invalid 
accordingly  we did not record a liability for the sat s assessment for the tax year in our consolidated financial statements 
on february   we received notice from the sat upholding the original assessment 
on april   we filed a petition in mexico tax court disputing the assessment 
at a hearing of the mexico tax court on february   the five justices unanimously decided to set aside the tax assessment and declared it null and void 
the sat will have business days following service of the written decision in which to appeal the decision to the circuit collegiate court 
regardless of whether or not the sat appeals this decision  we do not believe the outcome of this proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the sat also claimed unpaid taxes related to services performed among our subsidiaries for horizon s through taxable years 
during  we successfully completed negotiations with the sat with respect to their claim of unpaid taxes related to horizon s through taxable years  and paid an aggregate of approximately million in settlement of these periods 
horizon s through tax audits were closed in  settling this particular claim by the sat 
in we also filed amendments for tax years through using the same methodology used in the settlement for the through years 
the amended returns were accepted by the mexican tax authority in march  effectively settling this particular claim 
even though we have settled this issue for these years  under mexican tax law there is a five year statute of limitations  so our tax years through remain open for examination in mexico

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
business and outlook our performance continued to be affected by challenging market conditions on the gulf of mexico ocs 
the significantly reduced drilling activity in associated with the macondo well blowout and our inability to secure work in the highly competitive market in southeast asia had significant negative consequences on our business in positive contributions to our financial results during included strong diving activity in australia  the successful execution of a large construction project in the bahamas which was completed in the second quarter of  the substantial completion of a successful pipelay project in mexico in the fourth quarter of and the commencement of a second pipelay project in mexico in the fourth quarter of that we expect to be completed in the second quarter of markets in southeast asia continue to be highly competitive due to the increased marine construction capacity that has come into service 
as a result  we have reduced our operational scope and overhead in that region 

table of contents after macondo  there continues to be a significant amount of uncertainty in the market regarding the united states regulatory environment for our industry 
we believe this uncertainty  coupled with reduced natural gas prices  will continue to affect our customers spending levels for the near term 
nonetheless  although the recovery on the gulf of mexico ocs following the macondo well blowout has been slow  the permitting process  which affects all phases of our business  is improving 
we believe this improvement will benefit our operating results for fiscal  as demand for our construction services typically lags behind drilling activity by six to months and sometimes longer 
we also expect to benefit in from our significant cost saving initiatives implemented in  which included headcount reductions 
while we expect the challenging market conditions that we have been experiencing since to continue into early with some improvement  it is unclear how long these factors will continue to disrupt the market conditions for our industry 
we believe the intermediate and long term outlook for our business remains favorable in both domestic and international markets as capital spending will be required to replenish offshore oil and natural gas production  and for domestic industry participants to satisfy idle iron regulations and other directives promulgated by bsee regarding the decommissioning of platforms and pipelines in the united states gulf of mexico  which should drive long term demand for our services 
fiscal performance we generated a net loss of million 
per diluted share for the year ended december   which includes million 
per diluted share of after tax  non cash impairment charges related to fixed assets 
this compares to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   which included million per diluted share of after tax  non cash impairment charges related to goodwill and fixed assets 
excluding the impairment charges in and  we recorded a net loss of million  or 
per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or 
per diluted share in the increase in net loss excluding the impairment charges is primarily due to lower activity on the gulf of mexico ocs  which experienced a temporary period of elevated activity in related to cleanup efforts for the oil spill that resulted from the macondo well blowout 
partially offsetting this decline was increased diving related work in australia and reduced overhead costs as the result of our cost reduction efforts 
vessel utilization we believe vessel utilization is one of the most important performance measurements for our business 
utilization is a strong indicator of demand for our vessels and  as a result  the contract rates we may charge for our services 
as a marine contractor with significant operations in the gulf of mexico  our vessel utilization is typically lower during the winter and early spring due to unfavorable weather conditions in the gulf of mexico 
accordingly  we attempt to schedule our drydock inspections and other routine and preventative maintenance programs during this period 
from time to time  we temporarily remove from service certain vessels based on current market conditions 
the bid and award process during the first two quarters typically leads to the commencement of construction activities during the second and third quarters 
the seasonal trend for vessel utilization can be disrupted by hurricanes  which can cause severe offshore damage and generate significant demand for our services from oil and natural gas companies trying to restore shut in production 
this production restoration focus has led to increased demand for our services for prolonged periods following hurricanes  as was the case in the first half of following hurricanes gustav and ike in beginning in the fourth quarter of  and reflected in our results for the year ended december   our operations on the gulf of mexico ocs returned to more customary seasonal conditions 
the negative effect of this seasonality was further exacerbated by reduced construction work in resulting from significantly less drilling activity in  as well as reduced activity levels compared to the same period of when activity levels were higher due to oil spill cleanup efforts following the macondo well blowout 
these factors resulted in a net decrease in vessel utilization of across our fleet for the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
partially offsetting these negative factors was an increase in vessel utilization related to our construction project in the bahamas  which was completed in the second quarter  and our mexico project  which was substantially completed in the fourth quarter 
table of contents the following table shows the size of our fleet and effective utilization of our vessels during the past three fiscal years number of vessels utilization number of vessels utilization number of vessels utilization saturation diving surface and mixed gas diving construction barges entire fleet effective vessel utilization is calculated by dividing the total number of days the vessels generated revenues by the total number of days the vessels were available for operation in each year  including those temporarily removed from service  but excluding vessels while in drydock 
results of operations operating results year ended december  increase decrease to to dollars in thousands dollars in thousands revenues gross profit vessel utilization revenues decreased from to by million  or  and gross profit decreased by million or 
vessel utilization declined from in to in the decreases in revenues and gross profit in as compared to were primarily a result of reduced activity and lower margins in the gulf of mexico in resulting from slower than expected recovery in permitting activity levels and continued uncertainty in the region  compared to the year ended december  when activity levels were temporarily higher due to temporary oil spill cleanup efforts following the macondo well blowout 
offsetting this decline were revenues related to strong diving activity in australia  the successful execution of a large construction project in the bahamas which was completed in the second quarter of  the substantial completion of a successful pipelay project in mexico in the fourth quarter of and the commencement of a second pipelay project in mexico in the fourth quarter of that we expect to complete in the second quarter of revenues decreased from to by million  or  and gross profit decreased by million or 
vessel utilization declined from in to in the decreases in revenues and gross profit in as compared to were primarily a result of i fewer substantial integrated construction projects as compared to a liquefied natural gas project located offshore boston and two significant pipelay projects in china and mexico which were ongoing in that utilized multiple vessels and yielded significant profits  ii decreased demand for hurricane related repair work and salvage activity as compared to the increased activity experienced during as a result of hurricanes gustav and ike that passed through the gulf of mexico in the third quarter of and iii significantly lower day rates 
goodwill impairment year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands dollars in thousands goodwill impairment 
table of contents prompted by the significant decline in market capitalization  adverse change in the business climate and significant declines in operating results  during we completed an impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets which resulted in million of goodwill impairment charges 
as a result of this impairment  we do not carry an amount for goodwill as of december  there were no comparable impairment charges during or fixed assets impairment year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands dollars in thousands fixed assets impairment during and we incurred million and million  respectively  of pre tax impairment charges related to certain fixed assets 
in the period  these impairment charges included a dive support vessel that experienced low utilization in the southeast asia region  and an idle shallow water pipelay barge from which most of its equipment had been removed 
in the period  these impairment charges included four construction barges  for which the outlook for their future utilization was uncertain 
selling and administrative expenses year ended december  increase decrease to to dollars in thousands dollars in thousands selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues selling and administrative expenses decreased from to by million  or primarily due to our cost saving initiatives  as well as decreases in certain accruals relating to certain employee benefit plans 
these were partially offset by million in one time severance costs related to headcount reductions 
as a percentage of revenue  selling and administrative expenses were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december selling and administrative expenses decreased from to by million  or 
the decreases were primarily due to lower incentive cash compensation in  cost control measures initiated by management in the fourth quarter of in response to the downturn in business activity  and lower amortization expense for certain intangible assets recognized as part of the horizon acquisition  which became fully amortized in the second quarter of provision for recovery of doubtful accounts year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands dollars in thousands provision for recovery of doubtful accounts no provision for doubtful accounts was recorded during the million reversal of provision for doubtful accounts during is due to a collection of a receivable previously reserved as bad debt on a west africa project 
the million reversal of provision for doubtful accounts recorded during resulted from the collection of trade receivables from the court administering the bankruptcy of a previous customer 

table of contents the provision for doubtful accounts recorded during was comprised of million reserved for customers that filed for bankruptcy protection during the year and million for contract disputes with customers 
we intend to pursue all commercial and legal avenues for collection of the receivables currently reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts

in  we sold a portable saturation system to a third party for cash proceeds totaling million and recognized a gain on the sale of million 
we sold two utility vessels to different third parties for million and recognized a gain on the sale of million 
other income expense is primarily from foreign currency gains and losses on transactions conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
in addition  we recorded an impairment charge of million during for abandonment of buildings and leasehold improvements 
interest expense  net year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands dollars in thousands interest expense  net the increase in interest expense  net from to is primarily due to changes in variable interest rates

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations  available cash and cash equivalents and availability under our revolving credit facility 
we use  and intend to continue using  these sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements  maintenance capital expenditures  strategic investments and acquisitions 
for  we anticipate capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions or investments in joint ventures  of approximately million for vessel improvements and replacements  and million for regulatory drydock costs 
in connection with our business strategy  we regularly evaluate acquisition and joint venture opportunities  including vessels and marine contracting businesses 
we expect to be able to fund our activities for the next twelve months with cash flows generated from our operations  available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
our access to liquidity to fund our business activities and achieve our near term and long term growth objectives depends on the availability of financing in the capital markets which have recently experienced significant volatility 
given the current market conditions and our reliance on our credit facility  further deterioration in the market conditions could adversely affect our liquidity position 
credit facility we have a senior secured credit facility  consisting of a variable interest term loan and a variable interest million revolving credit facility  with certain financial institutions 
at december   we had outstanding debt of million under our term loan  including current maturities and no debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility and the term loan mature on april  we may prepay all or any portion of the outstanding balance of the term loan without prepayment penalty 
we may borrow from or repay the revolving credit facility as business needs merit 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants under our credit facility 
by an amendment dated october   but effective as of october   we amended the credit agreement to  among other things  i increase our permitted maximum consolidated leverage debt to earnings before interest  income taxes and depreciation and amortization or ebitda ratio to x for the fiscal quarter ending december   ii permanently reduce the size of the revolving credit facility from million to million and temporarily remove the million accordion feature  iii for the fiscal quarter ending march   temporarily limit the amount available for borrowing and letters of credit under the million revolving credit facility to million and waive the leverage ratio covenant  iv eliminate the current ebitda to interest financial covenant effective immediately  and  beginning in the fiscal quarter ending june   replace it with a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of not less than x  and v temporarily add a collateral coverage sublimit on the amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
following the fiscal quarter ending march   and assuming we are in compliance with the covenants described above  the full million of the revolver will again be available for borrowing and letters of credits subject to the leverage ratio covenant  and our maximum permitted leverage ratio covenant will increase to x for the quarter ending june  the amendment made no changes to the million term loan or its amortization schedule 
depending on our compliance with certain financial ratio covenants  we may be required to prepay a portion of our term loan with the proceeds from any asset sales 

table of contents at december   we had million of cash on hand  issued and outstanding letters of credit of million under our revolving credit facility  and million of outstanding warranty and bid bonds 
the amount we can borrow under our revolver is limited by outstanding borrowing  letters of credit  and our consolidated leverage debt to ebitda ratio covenant 
under the credit agreement  our permitted leverage ratio was x for the period through december  based on our consolidated leverage debt to ebitda ratio and outstanding borrowing and letters of credit as of december   we had approximately million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
cash flows our cash flows depend on the level of spending by oil and natural gas companies for marine contracting services 
certain sources and uses of cash  such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures  issuance and repurchases of debt and of our common stock  are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based on market conditions 
the following table summarizes our cash flows from operations  investing and financing activities for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million during  including a million prepayment on a decommissioning project  compared to million during the primary reason for the decrease in cash flows from operating activities is the net loss  excluding non cash impairment charges  for the year ended december  of million  compared to net loss  excluding non cash impairment charges  for the year ended december  of million 
additionally  working capital and other balance sheet accounts used million of cash during compared to million of cash provided in this increase in cash used was primarily due to accelerated payment terms related to accounts receivables on a large project in investing activities

for information regarding our principles of consolidation  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and policies our accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in our consolidated financial statements and related notes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  changing capital market conditions and other factors that could affect the ongoing viability of our business and our customers 
we believe the most critical accounting policies in this regard are those described below 
while these issues require us to make judgments that are somewhat subjective  they are generally based on a significant amount of historical data and current market data 
revenue recognition we determine the appropriate revenue recognition accounting method for each of our contracts at the beginning of the project 
most of our revenues are derived from contracts that have a short duration 
these contracts contain either qualified lump sum provisions or provisions for specific time  material and equipment charges  which we bill in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
revenue generated from qualified lump sum contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
changes in the expected cost of materials and labor  productivity  scheduling and other factors may affect the total estimated costs 
additionally  external factors  including weather or other factors outside of our control  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and  therefore  delay the timing of income and revenue recognition 
we routinely review estimates related to our contracts and reflect revisions to profitability in earnings on a current basis 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates an ultimate loss on a contract  we recognize the projected loss in full when it is first determined as required under generally accepted accounting principles 
we recognize additional contract revenue related to claims when the claim is probable and legally enforceable 

table of contents in determining whether a contract should be accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we follow the accounting guidelines for the performance of construction type contracts 
the use of this method is based on our experience and history of being able to prepare reasonably dependable estimates of the cost to complete our projects 
although we constantly seek to improve our ability to estimate revenue  contract costs and profitability  adjustments to total contract costs due to unanticipated events could be significant in future periods 
revenues generated from specific time  materials and equipment contracts are generally earned on a dayrate basis and recognized as delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
property and equipment we record our property and equipment at cost  net of recorded impairments 
we depreciate our assets primarily on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
our estimates of useful lives of our assets are as follows vessels to years  portable saturation diving systems ten to years  machinery and equipment five to ten years  and buildings and leasehold improvements three to years 
major replacements and improvements  which extend the vessel s economic useful life or functional operating capability  are capitalized and depreciated over their economic useful lives 
we expense the costs of repairs and maintenance which do not materially prolong the useful life of the property and equipment as incurred 
inherent in this process are estimates we make regarding the specific cost incurred and the period that the incurred cost will benefit 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of our property and equipment may not be recoverable 
we base our evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions 
if such impairment indicators are present  we determine whether an impairment has occurred through projected net undiscounted cash flows based on expected operating results over the remaining life of the asset group 
the cash flows are based on historical data adjusted for management estimates of future market performance that rely on existing market data  industry trends  expected utilization and margins 
management s estimates may vary considerably from actual outcomes due to future adverse market conditions  poor operating results  or other factors that could result in our inability to recover the current carrying value of long lived assets  which could possibly require an impairment charge in the future 
in we recorded million of impairment charges related to certain fixed assets  including a dive support vessel that experienced low utilization for an extended period of time in the southeast asia region  and an idle shallow water pipelay barge from which most of its equipment had been removed 
in we recorded million of impairment charges related to certain fixed assets  consisting of four idle construction barges for which the outlook for future utilization was uncertain 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in for buildings and leasehold improvements we have abandoned 
fixed asset impairments under asc topic  property  plant and equipment  we perform an annual impairment review of our long lived assets 
for long lived assets  we base our evaluation of recoverability on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  historical or future profitability measurements and other relevant external market conditions or factors 
if we determine that an impairment of a long lived asset has occurred  we recognize a loss on our financial statements equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
during  we determined that impairment indicators existed with respect to certain of our long lived fixed assets including a dive support vessel that experienced low utilization for an extended period of time in the southeast asia region and an idle shallow water pipelay barge from which most of its equipment had been removed 
we evaluated the recoverability of these fixed assets  the fair value of which we included in the impairment analysis determined by using the income valuation approach  market based appraisals and estimated scrap value 
as a result of this analysis we recorded million of pre tax fixed assets impairment expense for the third quarter ended september  in the fourth quarter of  our dive support vessel was further impaired by million based on a market price offer received in february this vessel is classified as assets held for sale and included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet at december  
table of contents during  we performed an impairment test on four idle construction barges and determined that they were subject to impairment indicators resulting from the uncertain outlook regarding their future utilization 
the fair values of three of the barges were determined using the income valuation approach and the fair value of the fourth barge was based on its scrap value 
as a result of this analysis we recorded million of pre tax fixed assets impairment expense for the third quarter ended september  derivative instruments and hedging activities we use derivative financial instruments to hedge the impact of market price risk exposure primarily due to variable interest rate exposure related to our debt 
to reduce the impact of these risks on earnings and to increase the predictability of our cash flows  we enter into interest rate swaps from time to time 
we formally document all relations between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives  strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions and our methods for assessing and testing correlation and hedge effectiveness 
we also assess  both at inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in our hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items 
changes in the assumptions used could impact whether the fair value change in an interest rate swap is charged to earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income 
income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes  we recognize income tax expense for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the current provision for income tax is based upon the current tax laws and our interpretation of these laws  as well as the probable outcomes of any foreign or domestic tax audits 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we compute deferred income taxes using the liability method 
we provide for deferred income taxes on all temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities by applying enacted statutory tax rates  applicable to future years 
allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions to the provisions for income taxes 
our most significant judgments on tax related matters include tax valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 
these matters involve the exercise of significant judgment which could change and materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 
the realization of our deferred tax assets depends on recognition of sufficient future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions during periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts we believe are more likely than not to be recovered 
in evaluating our valuation allowance  we consider the reversal of existing temporary differences  the existence of taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies and future taxable income for each of our taxable jurisdictions  the latter two of which involve the exercise of significant judgment 
changes to our valuation allowance could materially impact our results of operations 
we have liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions connected with ongoing examinations and open tax years 
changes in our assessment of these liabilities may require us to increase the liability and record additional tax expense or reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit which would positively or negatively impact our effective tax rate 
we do not provide for us income taxes on foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings intended to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations 
for financial reporting purposes  our provision for income taxes has been computed on the basis that we have completed and filed separate federal income tax returns for all periods presented 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve 
allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible  including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices  customer satisfaction claims and pricing discrepancies 
depending on how these issues are resolved  or if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowance may be required 

table of contents loss contingencies we accrue loss contingency reserves when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of our liabilities are based on an evaluation of potential outcomes and currently available facts 
we attempt to resolve these matters through settlements  mediation and arbitration proceedings when possible 
actual results may differ from our estimates  and our estimates can be revised in the future  either negatively or positively  depending upon actual outcomes or changes in expectations based on the facts surrounding each matter 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of certain new accounting pronouncements that may affect our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in our normal business activities 
market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with existing or forecasted financial transactions 
the types of market risks to which we are exposed are credit risk  interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
credit risk 
our financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
cash equivalents such as deposits and temporary cash investments are held by major banks 
our trade receivables are with a variety of us  international and foreign country national oil and natural gas companies 
management considers this credit risk to be limited due to the financial resources of these companies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and we generally do not require material collateral to support contractual payment obligations 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses 
interest rate risk 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding under our credit facility 
changes based on the floating interest rates under this facility could result in an increase or decrease in our annual interest expense and related cash outlay 
to reduce the potentially adverse impact of changes in interest rates on our variable rate term loan  in august we entered into a twelve month interest rate swap with a notional amount of million that converts a portion of our anticipated variable rate interest payments under our term loan to fixed rate interest payments of 
this interest rate swap began to settle in december and expired in december in may  we entered into a second twelve month interest rate swap with a notional amount of million that converts the same portion of our anticipated variable rate interest payments under our term loan to fixed rate interest payments of 
this interest rate swap began to settle in december and will expire in december in august  we entered into a third twelve month interest rate swap with a notional amount of million that converts the same portion of our anticipated variable rate interest payments under our term loan to fixed rate interest payments of 
this interest rate swap will begin to settle in december and will expire in december all of these interest rate swap instruments qualify as cash flow hedges under hedge accounting 
from time to time  there may be economic sharing among more than one counterparty related to our interest rate swaps 
we expect the current interest rate swap to effectively fix our variable interest payments made on million of our term loan  or approximately as of december   at on a weighted average basis plus the current average applicable loan margin of approximately for a total interest rate of 
a hypothetical increase of in quoted interest rates as of december  would increase interest expense by million and million in and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have operations in foreign locations that subject us to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
although the vast majority of our business is transacted in us dollars  we transact business in euro dollars  mexican pesos  singapore dollars  and australian dollars  among others 
historically  foreign currency exchange rate risk has not been material to our business and we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts 
at various times  we utilize the payment structure of customer contracts to selectively hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets  liabilities  cash flows and commitments denominated in certain foreign currencies 
as we continue to grow our international operations  foreign currency exchange rate risk may become more significant and we may mitigate our foreign currency risk with foreign currency derivative instruments in the future
