item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations related party transactions 
marketing and pricing general we derive revenue principally from the sale of oil and natural gas 
as a result  our revenues are determined  to a large degree  by prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas 
we sell our oil and natural gas on the open market at prevailing market prices 
the market price for oil and natural gas is dictated by supply and demand  and we cannot accurately predict or control the price we may receive for our oil and natural gas 
the company generally markets its us and canadian oil and natural gas production under month to month or spot contracts and  in some cases  under contracts of approximately one year duration 
marketing of us production since mid  we have received premium pricing for our marketing of the crude oil produced from our eagle ford shale properties 
we attribute this premium pricing to the high quality and geographic location of the crude oil product 
this crude oil is approximately to degrees api gravity and is considered sweet because it is low in sulfur 
since our production is within relatively close proximity to refineries near corpus christi  texas  the houston ship channel and st 
james  louisiana  we are able to utilize to some extent the price differentials existing in the west texas intermediate  or wti  and louisiana light sweet markets to gain better pricing for our marketing of the production 
this combination of production location and crude oil quality have allowed us to sell our eagle ford shale crude oil at prices above wti price postings during the second half of and into  and we anticipate that market conditions should allow us to continue to receive pricing above wti postings further into currently  we are marketing our eagle ford shale crude oil at prices that are averaging approximately per bbl above wti price postings 
we market our eagle ford shale crude oil production to at least three markets to assure competitive pricing  retain the ability to move production as quickly as possible and reduce buyer credit exposure 

table of contents we generally sell our natural gas production on month to month or spot pricing contracts to a variety of buyers  including large marketing companies  local distribution companies and industrial customers 
we diversify our markets to help reduce buyer credit risk and to ensure steady daily deliveries of our natural gas production 
as natural gas production increases in our core operating areas  especially in the appalachian basin region  we believe that we and other producers in these areas will find it increasingly important to find markets that have the ability to move natural gas volumes through an increasingly capacity constrained infrastructure 
we sell natural gas liquids extracted from our eagle ford shale natural gas production to the processing plant operator at current spot prices 
we expect that our natural gas liquids other than ethane  when and if extracted to be extracted and fractionated by markwest liberty  when markwest liberty s mobley gas processing complex becomes operational  will be marketed by markwest liberty at prevailing market prices 
we will be responsible for the marketing of such ethane  if and when extracted  depending on when the mobley complex goes into ethane recovery mode 
we expect that several markets will be available at that time for ethane sales 
marketing of canadian production our oil production in alberta and saskatchewan is sold through a crude oil marketing firm 
our oil production is mostly degrees api gravity and is considered sweet since it contains only a small percentage of sulfur 
typically  clean oil is hauled from our facilities to a truck terminal where it enters the north american pipeline system and is sold to purchasers at monthly spot prices 
the majority of our oil production is sold at a bench mark price at cromer  canada and adjusted for equalization and all applicable transportation charges to cromer 
our canadian natural gas production is sold through a marketing consulting firm 
we currently sell gas from our alberta properties to a buyer at spot natural gas prices less transportation  fuel and measurement variance costs  under a one year contract ending on october we sell a small amount of natural gas liquids extracted from some of our alberta natural gas production to the processing plant operator at current spot prices 
derivatives we use commodity price hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to oil and natural gas price fluctuations and to help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our debt service costs  preferred dividend payments and future capital programs 
from time to time  we may enter into futures contracts  collars and basis swap agreements  as well as fixed price physical delivery contracts  however  it is our preference to utilize hedging strategies that provide downside commodity price protection without unduly limiting our revenue potential in an environment of rising commodity prices 
we use hedging primarily to manage price risks and returns on certain acquisitions and drilling programs 
our policy is to consider hedging an appropriate portion of our production at commodity prices we deem attractive 
pricing our revenues  cash flows  profitability and future rate of growth depend substantially upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital 
lower prices may also adversely affect the value of our reserves and make it uneconomic for us to commence or continue drilling for crude oil and natural gas 
historically  the prices received for oil and natural gas have fluctuated widely 
among the factors that can cause these fluctuations are uncertainty in the global economy  changes in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas  the condition of the united states  canadian and global economies  the actions of certain foreign countries  
table of contents the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and liquid natural gas  political conditions  including embargoes  war or civil unrest in or affecting oil producing activities of certain countries  the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity  the level of global oil and natural gas inventories  production or pricing decisions made by the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  weather conditions  technological advances affecting energy consumption or production  and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
from time to time  we enter into hedging arrangements and offset rights with our derivative counterparties to reduce our exposure to decreases in the prices of oil and natural gas 
hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of significant financial loss in certain situations  including circumstances where our production and or sales of oil and natural gas are less than expected  payments owed under derivative hedging contracts come due prior to receipt of the hedged month s production revenue  or the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations 
in addition  hedging arrangements limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the price of oil and natural gas 
hedging transactions we may enter into may not adequately protect us from a decline in the price of oil and natural gas above certain caps 
furthermore  should we choose not to engage in hedging transactions in the future to the extent we are not otherwise obligated to hedge under our credit facilities  we may be adversely affected by volatility in oil and natural gas prices

under these ngas drilling partnerships  proceeds from the private placement of interests in each investment partnership  together with an ngas capital contribution  were contributed to a separate joint venture or program that ngas formed with that partnership to conduct the drilling operations 
in december  our subsidiary  magnum hunter production  completed its first sponsored drilling partnership  energy hunter partners a  ltd  raising approximately million from accredited investors 
the drilling partnership is structured to allow these investors to participate with magnum hunter production in a portfolio of wells being drilled by the company in our unconventional resource plays in the southern appalachian basin  the marcellus shale and the eagle ford shale 
the drilling partnership participates in the project wells through a joint venture operating partnership  referred to as the program  with magnum hunter production  which serves as the managing general partner of the drilling partnership and the program 
proceeds from the private placement of interests in the drilling partnership  together with magnum hunter production capital contributions  were contributed to the program to fund the program s share of drilling and completion costs of the project wells 
interests in the program are shared proportionately until distributions to the drilling partnership reach of its investment in the program  after which magnum hunter production will earn an additional reversionary interest in the program  the amount of which depends on the timing of such payout 
the program participates in the drilling and completion of the project wells on a cost plus basis 
magnum hunter production plans to sponsor an additional drilling and or income partnership or partnerships in to participate in company drilling and acquisition initiatives 
our program and any future programs are designed to enable us to accelerate the development of our properties without relinquishing control over drilling and operating decisions  while also enabling us to hold valuable acreage for future development 
reserves our oil and gas properties are primarily located in i the appalachian basin in west virginia  ohio and kentucky  with substantial acreage in the marcellus shale area in west virginia  ii the eagle ford shale area in south texas  and iii the williston basin in north dakota and canada 
cawley  gillespie associates  inc  independent petroleum consultants  which we refer to as cga  has estimated our us oil and natural gas reserves other than north dakota reserves and the present value of future net revenues therefrom as of december  those estimates were determined based on prices and costs as of or for the twelve month period ended december  ajm deloitte and touche  llp  independent petroleum consultants  which we 
table of contents refer to as ajm  has estimated our canadian and north dakota oil and natural gas reserves and the present value of future net revenues therefrom as of december  those estimates were determined based on prices and costs as of or for the twelve month period ended december  since january   we have not filed  nor were we required to file  any reports concerning our oil and gas reserves with any federal authority or agency  other than the sec and canadian regulatory authorities 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and estimates of reserve quantities and values must be viewed as being subject to significant change as more data about the properties become available 
proved reserves in december  the sec released its finalized rule for modernization of oil and gas reporting 
the new rule requires disclosure of oil and gas proved reserves by significant geographic area  using the arithmetic month average beginning of the month price for the year  as opposed to using year end prices as was practiced in all previous years 
the rule also allows for the use of reliable technologies to estimate proved oil and gas reserves  contingent on demonstrated reliability  in conclusions about reserve volumes 
under the new rules  companies are required to report on the independence and qualifications of their reserve preparers or auditors  and file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserve estimates or conduct a reserve audit 
the following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves based on the new sec rules as defined in rule a of regulation s x and item of regulation s k

reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and remain subject to revisions based on production history  results of additional exploration and development  prices of oil and natural gas and other factors 
please read item a 
risk factors our estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
you should also read the notes following the table below and our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in conjunction with the following reserve estimates

estimated recoverable proved reserves have been determined without regard to any economic impact that may result from our financial derivative activities 
these calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry 
the reserve information shown is estimated 
the certainty of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data  and the precision of the engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
the estimates of reserves  future cash flows and present value are based on various assumptions  and are inherently imprecise 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual future production  cash flows  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates 
we converted natural gas to oil equivalent at a ratio of six mcf to one boe 
represents the present value  discounted at per annum pv  of estimated future cash flows before income tax of our estimated proved reserves 
the estimated future cash flows set forth above were determined by using reserve quantities of proved reserves and the periods in which they are expected to be developed and produced based on prevailing economic conditions 
the estimated future production is priced based on the month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for the period january through december  using per bbl and per mmbtu and adjusted by lease for transportation fees and regional price differentials 
management believes that the presentation of the non gaap financial measure of pv provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies

as of december   our proved undeveloped reserves  or puds  on an sec basis totaled mmboe of crude oil and ngls and bcf of natural gas for a total of mmboe 
changes in puds that occurred during the year were due to increased drilling activity in our eagle ford shale  marcellus shale and bakken shale three forks sanish areas

the most significant amendments to the requirements included the following commodity prices economic producibility of reserves and discounted cash flows are now based on a month average commodity price unless contractual arrangements designate the price to be used 
disclosure of unproved reserves probable and possible reserves may be disclosed separately on a voluntary basis 
proved undeveloped reserve guidelines reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped if there is a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered and they are scheduled to be drilled within the next five years  unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time 
reserves estimation using new technologies reserves may be estimated through the use of reliable technology in addition to flow tests and production history 
reserves personnel and estimation process additional disclosure is required regarding the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the reserves estimation process 
we are also required to provide a general discussion of our internal controls used to assure the objectivity of the reserves estimate 
non traditional resources the definition of oil and gas producing activities has expanded and focuses on the marketable product rather than the method of extraction

cga and ajm do not own an interest in any of our properties and are not employed by us on a contingent basis 
we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with cga and ajm to ensure the integrity  accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved oil and gas reserves 
our internal technical team members meet with cga and ajm periodically throughout the year to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process 
we provide historical 
table of contents information to cga and ajm for our properties such as ownership interest  oil and gas production  well test data  commodity prices  and operating and development costs 
the preparation of our proved reserve estimates is completed in accordance with our internal control procedures  which include the verification of input data used by cga and ajm  as well as extensive management review and approval 
all of our reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our executive vice president of operations and our vice president of reservoir engineering 
our executive vice president of operations holds a bs in petroleum engineering from the university of louisiana lafayette with more than years of experience and is a member of the national society of professional engineers  society of petroleum engineers  and the society of petroleum evaluation engineers

table of contents non gaap measures  reconciliations this annual report contains certain financial measures that are non gaap measures 
we have provided reconciliations within this report of the non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  measures for financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap that are presented in this report 
pv is the present value of the estimated future cash flows from estimated total proved reserves after deducting estimated production and ad valorem taxes  future capital costs and operating expenses  but before deducting any estimates of future income taxes 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted at an annual rate of to determine their present value 
we believe pv to be an important measure for evaluating the relative significance of our oil and gas properties and that the presentation of the non gaap financial measure of pv provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and investors in evaluating oil and gas companies 
because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid  we believe the use of a pre tax measure is valuable for evaluating the company 
we believe that pv is a financial measure routinely used and calculated similarly by other companies in the oil and gas industry 
however  pv should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure as computed under gaap

in october  eureka hunter and markwest liberty entered into a mutual cooperation agreement whereby both companies agreed to jointly develop natural gas related services to support marcellus shale producers in a significant geographic area in northwest west virginia 
pursuant to this agreement  eureka hunter sold its mmcfe per day capacity thomas russell cryogenic natural gas processing plant  which was then under construction  to markwest liberty 
markwest liberty intends to install this new plant  the mobley plant  adjacent to markwest liberty s mmcfe per day capacity natural gas processing plant  the mobley plant  near logansport  west virginia 
we anticipate that the mobley plant will be in commercial operation during the third quarter of and the mobley plant will be in commercial operation during the fourth quarter of markwest liberty will also provide natural gas liquids handling and fractionation services for mobley plant product 
these agreements with markwest liberty will allow eureka hunter to offer third party producers in the marcellus shale not only gas gathering services through our eureka hunter pipeline system  but also access to natural gas processing at markwest liberty s mobley complex 

table of contents eureka hunter plans to extend its eureka hunter pipeline system to the mobley processing complex before july  to enable it to deliver unprocessed natural gas production to both mobley plants for processing 
eureka hunter will be gathering both triad hunter s and other third parties natural gas production for delivery to the mobley processing complex 
initial delivery volumes from eureka hunter to the mobley complex are currently estimated to be in the to mmbtu per day range 
additionally  natural gas production processed at the mobley complex will be able to access both the columbia gas transmission and the equitrans interstate pipeline systems 
equity financings 
we raised substantial cash in the total amount of million in net proceeds  which are net of commissions  through equity transactions during through february  those transactions included million in net proceeds from common equity issuances  at an average price of per share  million in net proceeds from the issuance of our series c preferred stock  at a price of per share  million in net proceeds from the exercise of warrants and common stock options  and million in net proceeds from the issuance of our series d preferred stock 
we plan to continue raising both preferred and common equity in the future depending on our working capital needs  capital expenditure program  acquisition activities  and the overall capital markets

as of february   triad hunter owned mineral rights to a total of approximately  net acres that are presently prospective for the utica shale 
approximately  of these net acres are located in ohio which include the acreage acquired in february and the balance of which overlaps our marcellus shale acreage  and approximately  of the net acres are located in west virginia all of which overlaps our marcellus shale acreage 
as of february   our properties located in the southern appalachian basin included approximately  gross  net lease acres located primarily in kentucky 
our primary production from these properties comes from the devonian shale formation and the mississippian weir sandstone 
midstream eureka hunter pipeline system 
our acquisition of assets from triad energy in included important infrastructure assets for the efficient development of the company s marcellus shale and utica shale unconventional resources 
as of february   these assets include approximately miles of pipeline  gathering systems and or rights of way  which we are currently developing  located in northwestern west virginia and southeastern ohio  in the marcellus and utica shales 
we expect to have sufficient pipeline capacity to gather significant quantities of company produced natural gas from our marcellus shale and utica shale development programs  as well as substantial volumes of third party gas 
markwest processing agreement 
in october  triad hunter entered into certain midstream services agreements with markwest liberty pursuant to which markwest liberty will provide long term gas processing and related services for natural gas produced in northwest west virginia gathered by eureka hunter for both triad hunter and other producers through the eureka hunter pipeline system

these arrangements with markwest liberty will allow eureka hunter to offer third party producers in the marcellus shale not only gas gathering services through the eureka hunter pipeline system  but also access to natural gas processing at markwest liberty s mobley complex 
equipment and services our wholly owned subsidiary  alpha hunter drilling  llc  currently owns and operates five drilling rigs capable of drilling  to  feet  which are primarily used for vertical section top hole air drilling 
the drilling rigs are used for both the company s appalachian basin operations and to provide drilling services to third parties 
the company s fleet consists of three schramm txd drilling rigs and two schramm txd drilling rigs 
these drilling rigs primarily drill the top holes of the company s and third parties marcellus shale wells in preparation for larger drilling rigs  which drill the horizontal sections of the wells 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the us the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under us gaap 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
oil and gas activities successful efforts accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
the significant principles for this method are geological and geophysical evaluation costs are expensed as incurred  dry holes for exploratory wells are expensed  and dry holes for developmental wells are capitalized  and capitalized costs related to proved oil and gas properties  including wells and related equipment and facilities  are evaluated for impairment based on an analysis of undiscounted future net cash flows in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the net capitalized costs related to proved properties  then we recognize an impairment charge in income from operations equal to the difference between the net capitalized costs related to proved properties and their estimated fair values based on the present value of the related future net cash flows 

table of contents proved reserves on december   the sec released a final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  approving revisions designed to modernize oil and gas reserve reporting requirements 
the new reserve rules first became effective for our financial statements for the year ended december  and our year end proved reserve estimates 
the most significant revisions to the reporting requirements include commodity prices 
economic producibility of reserves is now based on the unweighted  arithmetic average of the closing price on the first day of the month for the month period prior to fiscal year end  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  undeveloped oil and gas reserves 
reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped for undrilled areas beyond one offsetting drilling unit from a producing well if there is reasonable certainty that the quantities will be recovered  reliable technology 
the rules now permit the use of new technologies to establish the reasonable certainty of proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes  unproved reserves 
probable and possible reserves may be disclosed separately on a voluntary basis  preparation of reserves estimates 
disclosure is required regarding the internal controls used to assure objectivity in the reserves estimation process and the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for preparing reserves estimates  and third party reports 
we are now required to file with the sec the report of any third party used to prepare or audit our reserve estimates 
in addition  in january  fasb issued accounting standards update  or the update  oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures  to provide consistency with the new reserve rules 
the update amends existing standards to align the reserves estimation and disclosure requirements under gaap with the requirements in the sec s reserve rules 
we adopted the new standards effective december  the new standards are applied prospectively as a change in estimate 
for the year ended december   we engaged cawley  gillespie associates  inc and ajm deloitte and touche  llp  independent petroleum engineers  to prepare independent estimates of the extent and value of the proved reserves associated with certain of our oil and gas properties in accordance with guidelines established by the sec  including the recent revisions designed to modernize oil and gas reserve reporting requirements 
we adopted these revisions effective december  estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates including depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  evaluation of impairment of properties and the calculation of plugging and abandonment liabilities 
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for any reservoir may change substantially over time due to results from operational activity 
proved reserve volumes at december   were estimated based on the unweighted  arithmetic average of the closing price on the first day of each month for the month period prior to december  for oil and natural gas in accordance with the new reserve rules 
the average price used for oil was and for natural gas was

table of contents derivative instruments and commodity derivative activities unrealized gains and losses  at fair value  are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts 
changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts are recorded in earnings as they occur and included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities 
we internally valued the collar contracts using industry standard option pricing models and observable market inputs 
we use our internal valuations to determine the fair values of the contracts that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses are also included in gain loss on derivative contracts on our consolidated statements of operations 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties on our commodity derivatives positions and have considered the exposure in our internal valuations 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties over the term of the commodity derivatives positions 
changes in the derivative s fair value are currently recognized in the statement of operations unless specific commodity derivative hedge accounting criteria are met and such strategies are designated 
for qualifying cash flow commodity derivatives  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss income to the extent the commodity derivative is effective 
the ineffective portion of the commodity derivative is recognized immediately in the statement of operations 
gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income are reclassified to oil and gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for commodity derivative accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current income or expense in the statement of operations 
historically  we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
we record our open derivative instruments at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives 
we record changes in such fair value in earnings on our consolidated statements of operations under the caption entitled gain loss on derivative contracts 
although we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges  we use those instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices related to our oil and gas production 
we record both realized and unrealized gains and losses under those instruments in other revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded i a realized loss from the settlement of derivative contracts of million for the year ended december   ii a realized gain from the settlement of derivative contracts of million for the year ended december  and iii a realized gain from the settlement of derivative contracts of million for the year ended december  realized gains and losses result from actual cash settlements received or paid under the derivative contracts 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
unrealized gains and losses result from changes in the fair market value of the derivative contracts from period to period  and represent non cash gains or losses 
changes in commodity prices could have a significant effect on the fair value of our derivative contracts 
a hypothetical increase in the nymex floating prices would have resulted in a million decrease in the december  fair value recorded on our balance sheet and a corresponding increase to the loss on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations 
a hypothetical decrease in the nymex floating prices would have a resulted in a million decrease in the december  fair value recorded on our balance sheet and would have partially offset the loss on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations by the corresponding amount

table of contents asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to proved properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
our liability is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
our liability for asset retirement obligations was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
see note asset retirement obligations to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
share based compensation our stock incentive plan allows grants of stock  options  and other stock based awards to employees and outside directors 
grants of awards may increase our general and administrative expenses subject to the size and timing of the grants 
for the years ended december    and  we recognized approximately million  million  and million in non cash stock compensation  respectively 
see note share based compensation to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
valuation of property and equipment the company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
asc requires that the company s long lived assets  including its oil and gas properties  be assessed for potential impairment in their carrying values whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such impairment may have occurred 
an impairment charge to current operations is recognized when the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the asset are less than its carrying value 
any such impairment is recognized based on the differences in the carrying value and estimated fair value of the impaired asset 
the guidance provides for future revenue from the company s oil and gas production to be estimated based upon prices at which management reasonably estimates such products will be sold 
these estimates of future product prices may differ from current market prices of oil and gas 
any downward revisions to management s estimates of future production or product prices could result in an impairment of the company s oil and gas properties in subsequent periods 
the long lived assets of the company which are subject to evaluation consist primarily of oil and gas properties 
due to the regularly scheduled impairment reviews by management  the company recognized a non cash  pre tax charge against earnings of approximately million  million  and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the impairment of proved oil and gas properties was calculated on a field by field basis under the successful efforts accounting method 
the impairment was recorded based upon the estimated fair value of a field when the undiscounted reserve value of the field was less than the net capitalized cost of the field at december  fair value was determined by calculating the present value of future net cash flows using nymex prices in effect during february see note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents revenue recognition revenues associated with sales of crude oil  natural gas  natural gas liquids and petroleum products  and other items are recognized when title passes to the customer  which is when the risk of ownership passes to the purchaser and physical delivery of goods occurs  either immediately or within a fixed delivery schedule that is reasonable and customary in the industry 
revenues from the production of natural gas and crude oil properties in which we have an interest with other producers are recognized based on the actual volumes we sold during the period 
any differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes  based on our net working interest  which are deemed to be non recoverable through remaining production  are recognized as accounts receivable or accounts payable  as appropriate 
cumulative differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes are generally not significant 
revenues from field servicing activities are recognized at the time the services are provided and earned as provided in the various contract agreements 
gas gathering revenues are recognized at the time the natural gas is delivered at the destination point 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we measure and record income tax contingency accruals in accordance with asc  income taxes 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management 
these reevaluations are based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  successfully settled issues under audit  expirations due to statutes  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the tax accrual 
we classify interest related to income tax liabilities as income tax expense  and if applicable  penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense 
the income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that are anticipated to be due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
the amended guidance changes several aspects of the fair value measurement guidance in asc  fair value measurement  further clarifying how to measure and disclose fair value 
this guidance amends the application of the highest and best use concept to be used only in the measurement of fair value of nonfinancial assets  clarifies that the measurement of the fair value of equity classified financial instruments should be performed from the perspective of a market participant who holds the instrument as an asset  clarifies that an entity that manages a group of financial assets and liabilities on the basis of its net risk exposure can measure those financial instruments on the basis of its net exposure to those risks  and 
table of contents clarifies when premiums and discounts should be taken into account when measuring fair value 
the fair value disclosure requirements also were amended 
the amendment is effective for the company at the beginning of january  with early adoption prohibited 
the adoption of this amendment is not expected to materially affect the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income which amended requirements for the presentation of other comprehensive income oci  requiring presentation of comprehensive income in either a single  continuous statement of comprehensive income or on separate but consecutive statements  the statement of operations and the statement of oci 
the amendment is effective for the company at the beginning of fiscal year with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this guidance will not impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows and will only impact the presentation of oci on the financial statements 
effects of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december    and although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the us economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment 
it may also increase the cost of labor or supplies 
to the extent permitted by competition  regulation and our existing agreements  we have and will continue to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of higher prices

production increased by  or  mboe to  mboe for the year ended december  from mboe for the year ended december  production for  on a boe basis  was oil and ngls and natural gas compared to oil and natural gas for the change in the percent of oil and gas produced was due to the acquisition of ngas closing in the first half of and success in our marcellus shale development program 
our average daily production was  boepd during compared to  boepd for representing an overall increase of  or  boepd 
the increase in production in compared to is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of nuloch and ngas closing in the first half of as well as organic growth as a result of the company s successful ongoing drilling program

the canadian operating segment initiated production in  as it was part of the nuloch acquisition completed in the first half of this segment provided mboe of production for the year ended december  production from the canadian segment comprised oil and ngls and natural gas on a boe basis 
oil and gas sales 
oil and gas sales increased  or million  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in oil and gas sales principally resulted from increases in our oil and natural gas production as a result of acquisitions and new drilling completed throughout the year in the unconventional resource plays 
the average price we received for our production decreased from per boe to per boe  or 
of the million increase in revenues  approximately million was attributable to an increase in oil prices partially offset by a decrease in gas prices  and million was attributable to the increase in production volumes of  mboe in the prices we receive for our products are generally tied to commodity index prices 
we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts in an attempt to offset some of the variability in prices see the discussion of commodity derivative activities below 
oilfield services revenue 
oilfield services revenue increased by  or million  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  oilfield services revenues for the year ended december  comprised million in water disposal service revenue  million of drilling services  and  in operator fees compared to million of water disposal revenue and million of drilling revenue for the year ended december  the increase in water disposal revenue primarily resulted from a contract with a large  integrated producer  and the increase in drilling revenue resulted in an increase in activity of service contracts with third party producers 
midstream operations eureka hunter pipeline revenue 
revenue from the eureka hunter pipeline segment increased by million  or  for the year ended december  to million from  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues resulted from the increased volume of natural gas products transported by the pipeline network and gathering system  as eureka hunter gathered approximately million mmbtu in compared to approximately  mmbtu in

other revenues decreased by  for the year ended december  lease operating expense 
our lease operating expenses  or loe  increased million  or  for the year ended december  to million per boe from million per boe for the year ended december  the increase in total loe is attributable to increased volume produced  which accounted for an increase in cost of million  reduced by lower cost per boe produced  which offset the volume effect by million 
the decrease in overall loe per boe cost is due to the impact of the lower per boe cost of the new production brought online during through our of the ongoing drilling program in our unconventional resource plays 
severance taxes and marketing 
our severance taxes and marketing increased by million  or  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in production taxes and marketing was due to the increase in oil and gas sales as explained above 
exploration 
we recorded million of exploration expense for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  we experienced higher geological and geophysical costs in as a result of the acquisitions of ngas and nuloch 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
we review for impairment our long lived assets to be held and used  including proved and unproved oil and gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting 
as a result of this review of the recoverability of the carrying value of our assets  we recorded an impairment of oil and gas properties of million and  for and  respectively 
the impairment charge related to certain proved oil and gas properties acquired as part of our acquisition of ngas in totaling million due to a significant decline in natural gas prices at december   which was a decrease compared to nymex natural gas index prices at the end of the year 
we also incurred impairment charges associated with our undeveloped acreage of  and  in our eagle ford shale and appalachian basin regions  respectively  due to expiring acreage that we chose not to develop 
the impairment was primarily due to a write down of our investment in the giddings field 
depletion  depreciation and accretion 
our depletion  depreciation and accretion expense  or dd a  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to increased production in our dd a per boe increased by  or  to per boe for the year ended december   compared to per boe for the year ended december  the increase in dd a per boe was primarily attributable to the higher cost to drill  complete  and equip our new eagle ford shale  marcellus shale and bakken shale wells  which are horizontally drilled wells and require more expensive completion techniques than traditional  vertically drilled wells 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses  or g a  increased million  or  to million per boe for the year ended december  from million per boe for the year ended december  g a expenses increased overall during due to expansion activities of the company 
non cash stock compensation totaled approximately million per boe for the year ended december  and million per boe for the year ended december  also included in in g a for are acquisition related costs of million per boe for the period  which were for legal  consulting  and other charges principally related to the acquisitions of ngas and nuloch 
in  we had million per boe of acquisition related expenses related to the acquisition of triad 
these costs were expensed due to accounting standards which require that acquisition costs must be expensed rather than capitalized as part of the cost of the asset being acquired for years beginning in interest expense  net 
our interest expense  net of interest income  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  approximately million of this increase is the result of a non cash write off of the unamortized balance of deferred financing fees from the credit facility that was replaced by the mhr senior revolving credit facility in april approximately million of the increase is the result of amortization of financing costs related to 
table of contents the mhr senior revolving credit facility  the eureka hunter term loan and the mhr term loan facility 
the remaining million increase is the result of our higher average debt level during and the increased interest due to the mhr term loan facility entered into during september of commodity derivative activities 
realized gains and losses from our commodity derivative activity decreased our earnings by million and increased our earnings by million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
realized gains and losses are derived from the relative movement of oil and gas prices on the products we sell in relation to the range of prices in our derivative contracts for the respective years 
the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives was million for and million for as commodity prices increase  the fair value of the open portion of those positions decreases  and vice versa 
as commodity prices decrease  the fair value of the open portion of those positions increases 
historically  we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges

contractual commitments our contractual commitments consist of long term debt  accrued interest on long term debt  operating lease obligations  drilling contracts  asset retirement obligations  and employment agreements with executive officers 
our long term debt comprises borrowings under our mhr senior revolving credit facility  mhr term loan facility and eureka hunter term loan  and term equipment debt assumed in the triad energy and ngas acquisitions 
interest on revolving debt is based on the rate applicable under our revolving credit facility  which was at december  the term equipment debt has an average interest rate of approximately at december  see note in our condensed consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we rent various office spaces in houston  texas  that total approximately  square feet at a cost of  per month for the remaining terms ranging from two to fifty two months 
triad hunter had various lease commitments for periods ranging from three to seventy four months at december   and with monthly payments of approximately  as of that date 
our williston hunter subsidiaries have office spaces in calgary  alberta and denver  colorado that have a combined monthly payment of  on may   the company entered into a total depth drilling contract

table of contents on june   the company entered into a twelve month drilling contract 
our remaining maximum liability under the drilling contract  which would apply if we terminated the contract before the end of its term  was approximately million as of december  our asset retirement obligation represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to proved properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 
we have outstanding employment agreements with three of our senior officers for terms ranging from four to nine months 
our maximum commitment under the employment agreements  which would apply if the employees covered by these agreements were all terminated without cause  was approximately  at december  the following table summarizes these commitments as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total after long term debt interest on long term debt operating lease obligations asset retirement obligations employment agreements with senior officers drilling contract commitment total see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our long term debt 
interest payments have been calculated by applying the interest rate of effective at december   on our revolving credit facility debt and to the outstanding term debt balance at december  operating lease obligations are for office space and equipment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our asset retirement obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include operating lease agreements 
we do not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk some of the information below contains forward looking statements 
the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and other related factors 
the disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses  but rather an indicator of reasonable possible losses 
this forward looking information provides an indicator of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for commodity derivative and investment purposes  not for trading purposes 

table of contents proved reserves estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates including depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  evaluation of impairment of properties and the calculation of plugging and abandonment liabilities 
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which  by analysis of geosciences and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for any reservoir may change substantially over time due to results from operational activity 
proved reserve volumes at december  were estimated based on the unweighted  arithmetic average of the closing price on the first day of each month for the month period prior to december  for natural gas  oil  and ngls  in accordance with new reserve rules 
changes in commodity prices and operation costs may also affect the overall evaluation of reservoirs 
a hypothetical decline in our december  estimated proved reserves would have increased our depletion expense by approximately million for the year ended december  commodity price risk given the current economic outlook  we expect commodity prices to remain volatile 
even modest decreases in commodity prices can materially affect our revenues and cash flow 
in addition  if commodity prices remain suppressed for a significant amount of time  we could be required under successful efforts accounting rules to write down our oil and gas properties 
we enter into financial swaps and collars to reduce the risk of commodity price fluctuations 
we do not designate such instruments as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  we record open commodity derivative positions on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and recognize changes in such fair values as income expense on our consolidated statements as they occur 
at december   we have the following commodity derivative positions outstanding natural gas period mmbtu day price per mmbtu collars jan dec  jan dec  swaps jan dec  jan dec  ceilings sold call jan dec  crude oil period bbls day price per bbl collars jan dec  jan dec  jan dec jan dec floors sold put jan dec floors purchased put jan dec at december  and  the fair value of our open derivative contracts was a net liability of approximately million  and an asset of  respectively 
currently  bank of montreal  keybank national association  credit suisse energy  llc  ubs ag london branch  and deutsche bank ag london branch are currently the only counterparties to our commodity derivatives positions 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties on our commodity derivatives positions 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties over 
table of contents the term of the commodity derivatives positions 
all counterparties are participants in our revolving credit facility  and the collateral for the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility is used as collateral for our commodity derivatives 
unrealized gains and losses  at fair value  are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts 
changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts are recorded in earnings as they occur and included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities 
we internally valued the collar  call  and put contracts using industry standard option pricing models and observable market inputs 
we use our internal valuations to determine the fair values of the contracts that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses are also included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
historically  we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
we record our open derivative instruments at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives 
we record changes in such fair value in earnings on our consolidated statements of operations under the caption entitled gain loss on derivative contracts 
although we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges  we use those instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices related to our oil and gas production 
we record both realized and unrealized gains and losses under those instruments in other revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded i a realized loss from the settlement of derivative contracts of million for the year ended december   ii a realized gain from the settlement of derivative contracts of million for the year ended december   and iii a realized gain from the settlement of derivative contracts of million for the year ended december  realized gains and losses result from actual cash settlements received or paid under the derivative contracts 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
unrealized gains and losses result from changes in the fair market value of the derivative contracts from period to period  and represent non cash gains or losses 
changes in commodity prices could have a significant effect on the fair value of our derivative contracts 
a hypothetical increase in the nymex floating prices would have resulted in a million decrease in the december  fair value recorded on our balance sheet and a corresponding increase to the loss on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations 
a hypothetical decrease in the nymex floating prices would have a resulted in a million decrease in the december  fair value recorded on our balance sheet and would have partially offset the loss on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations by the corresponding amount 
see note summary of significant accounting policies  note fair value of financial instruments  and note financial instruments and derivatives to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our derivative instruments 
to estimate the fair value of our commodity derivatives positions  we use market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
we primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and attempt to use the best available information 
we determine the fair value based upon the hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurement and lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurement 
the three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date 
at december   we had no level measurements 

table of contents level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
level includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies 
these models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions  including quoted forward prices for commodities  time value  volatility factors and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
our derivatives  which consist primarily of commodity swaps and collars  are valued using commodity market data which is derived by combining raw inputs and quantitative models and processes to generate forward curves 
where observable inputs are available  directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  the instrument is categorized in level at december   all of our commodity derivatives were valued using level measurements 
level pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources 
these inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value 
at december   our level measurements were used to calculate our asset retirement obligation and our impairment analysis of proved properties at december
