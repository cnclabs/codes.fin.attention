recently issued accounting pronouncements 
this section provides a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements applicable to six flags  including a discussion of the impact or potential impact of such standards on our financial statements when applicable 

table of contents the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements relating to future events or our future financial performance  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
please see the discussion regarding forward looking statements included under the caption cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors for a discussion of some of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
the following discussion and analysis presents information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
this information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the consolidated financial statements and this discussion and analysis reflect the effects of our reclassification of the assets  liabilities and results of parks previously divested  including our louisville and new orleans parks  as discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the impact of the chapter filing in june and our emergence on april  overview we own and operate regional theme  water and zoological parks and are the largest regional theme park operator in the world 
of the parks we currently own or operate  are located in the united states  one is located in mexico city  mexico and one is located in montreal  canada 
our parks are located in geographically diverse markets across north america and they generally offer a broad selection of state of the art and traditional thrill rides  water attractions  themed areas  concerts and shows  restaurants  game venues and retail outlets  thereby providing a complete family oriented entertainment experience 
we work continuously to improve our parks and our guests experiences and to meet our guests evolving needs and preferences 
our revenue is primarily derived from i the sale of tickets for entrance to our parks approximately of revenue in  ii the sale of food  merchandise  games and attractions inside our parks  and iii and sponsorship  licensing and other fees 
revenues from ticket sales and park sales is primarily impacted by park attendance 
revenues from sponsorship  licensing and other fees can be impacted by the term  timing and extent of services and fees under these arrangements  which can result in fluctuations from year to year 
during  our park earnings before interest  tax expense  depreciation and amortization park ebitda improved as a result of increased revenues and lower cash operating costs 
while attendance during only slightly increased  per capita guest spending improved as a result of the success of improved pricing  along with our season pass and group sales marketing initiatives 
our cash operating costs decreased primarily as a result of our ongoing focus on operational efficiency 
our principal costs of operations include salaries and wages  employee benefits  advertising  outside services  maintenance  utilities and insurance 
a large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed because our costs for full time employees  maintenance  utilities  advertising and insurance do not vary significantly with attendance 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and 
table of contents complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounting for the chapter filing we follow the accounting prescribed by fasb asc  which provides guidance for periods subsequent to a chapter filing regarding the presentation of liabilities that are and are not subject to compromise by the bankruptcy court proceedings  as well as the treatment of interest expense and presentation of costs associated with the proceedings 
in accordance with fasb asc  debt discounts or premiums as well as debt issuance costs should be viewed as valuations of the related debt 
when the debt has become an allowed claim and the allowed claim differs from the carrying amount of the debt  the recorded carrying amount should be adjusted to the allowed claim 
during the second quarter of  we wrote off costs that were associated with unsecured debt that was included in liabilities subject to compromise at april  premiums and discounts as well as debt issuance cost on debt that was not subject to compromise  such as fully secured claims  were not adjusted 
because the former stockholders of sfi owned less than of the voting shares after sfi emerged from bankruptcy  we adopted fresh start accounting effective may  whereby our assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair value using the principles of purchase accounting contained in fasb asc topic the difference between our estimated fair value and our identifiable assets and liabilities was recorded as goodwill 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of application of fresh start accounting and effects of the plan 
the implementation of the plan and the application of fresh start accounting as discussed in note b to the consolidated financial statements results in financial statements that are not comparable to financial statements in periods prior to emergence 
property and equipment with the adoption of fresh start accounting on april   property and equipment was revalued based on the new replacement cost less depreciation valuation methodology 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for assumptions used in determining the fair value of property and equipment under fresh start accounting 
property and equipment additions are recorded at cost and the carrying value is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
in those cases in which we determine that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  we depreciate the remaining net book value in excess of the salvage value over the revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense evenly through the remaining expected life 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets totaled  million at december   consisting of property and equipment  million  goodwill million and other intangible assets million 
with our adoption of fresh start accounting upon emergence  assets were initially revalued based on the fair values of long lived assets 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for assumptions used in determining fair value of long lived assets under fresh start accounting 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if indicators are identified that an asset may be impaired 
we identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
we then determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
we are a 
table of contents single reporting unit 
for each year  the fair value of the single reporting unit exceeded our carrying amount based on a comparison of the market price of our common stock to the carrying amount of our stockholders equity deficit 
accordingly  no impairment was required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit were to be less than the carrying amount  we would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets 
if such assets are not considered to be fully recoverable  any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in connection with the chapter filing  we rejected the lease with the kentucky state fair board relating to our louisville park and ceased operating the park 
in the first quarter of  we classified the results of operations for the louisville park as discontinued operations 
we recorded a million impairment of the louisville park assets  including million of inventory and prepaid expenses  as part of discontinued operations in the statement of operations for the year ended december  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation periods for our property and equipment and deferred revenue  for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets primarily net operating and capital loss carryforwards will be recovered by way of offset against taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect such amount as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million  million  million and million at december   december   april  and december   respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards and tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance at december   december   april  and december  is based on our estimates of taxable income solely from the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets reverse 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to increase or decrease our valuation allowance which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

table of contents variables that will impact whether our deferred tax assets will be utilized prior to their expiration include  among other things  attendance  per capita spending and other revenues  capital expenditures  levels of debt  interest rates  operating expenses  sales of assets  and changes in state or federal tax laws 
in determining the valuation allowance we do not consider  and under generally accepted accounting principles cannot consider  the possible changes in state or federal tax laws until the laws change 
to the extent we reduce capital expenditures  our future accelerated tax deductions for our rides and equipment will be reduced  and our interest expense deductions would decrease as the debt balances are reduced by cash flow that previously would have been utilized for capital expenditures 
increases in capital expenditures without corresponding increases in net revenues would reduce short term taxable income and increase the likelihood of additional valuation allowances being required as net operating loss carryforwards expire prior to their utilization 
conversely  increases in revenues in excess of operating expenses would reduce the likelihood of additional valuation allowances being required as the short term taxable income would increase net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
see note s to the consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to our emergence from chapter proceedings  our profitability has increased which may allow for us to begin to project future taxable income after and assess our valuation allowance as well 
recent events on december   we entered into a new  million credit agreement the new credit facility  which replaced the first lien amendment and related facilities 
the new credit facility is comprised of a million revolving credit loan facility the new revolving loan  a million tranche a term loan facility the term loan a and an million tranche b term loan facility the term loan b and together with the term loan a  the new term loans 
in certain circumstances  the term loan b can be increased by million 
the proceeds from the million new term loans were used  along with million of existing cash  to retire the million senior term loan 
also in connection with the new credit facility  the tw loan and associated guarantee were terminated 
we incurred approximately million in fees and expenses in connection with the new credit facility and the repayment of the senior term loan  and we expect annual cash savings to be approximately million 
in connection with the new credit facility  we recorded an aggregate million loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on may   holdings board of directors approved a two for one stock split of holdings common stock effective in the form of a stock dividend of one share of common stock for each outstanding share of common stock

table of contents we initiated a stock repurchase plan the first stock repurchase plan  which permitted holdings to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock over a three year period  as a sound use of our cash and a responsible way to enhance shareholder value 
during the year ended december   holdings repurchased an aggregate of  shares at a cumulative price of approximately million under the first stock repurchase plan

see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the impact of the disposition of theme parks on our financial position and results of operations 
liquidity  capital commitments and resources general our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  funds from borrowings and existing cash on hand 
our principal uses of cash include the funding of working capital obligations  debt service  investments in parks including capital projects  common stock dividends  payments to our partners in the partnership parks  and common stock repurchases 
sfi did not pay a dividend on sfi s common stock during or the four months ended april  during the year ended december  and  holdings paid million and million  respectively  in cash dividends on its common stock

the board of directors declared the first quarter dividend of per common share will be payable on march  to stockholders of record on march  the amount and timing of any future dividends payable on holdings common stock are within the sole discretion of holdings board of directors 
we currently anticipate paying approximately million in cash dividends on our common stock for the calendar year 
in february  we initiated a stock repurchase plan the first stock repurchase plan  which permitted holdings to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock over a three year period 
during the year ended december   holdings repurchased an aggregate of  shares at a cumulative price of approximately million under the first stock repurchase plan

on january   holdings board of directors approved a new stock repurchase plan that permits holdings to repurchase up to million in shares of holdings common stock over a four year period the second stock repurchase plan 
we believe that  based on historical and anticipated operating results  cash flows from operations  available cash and available amounts under the new credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs  including anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  common stock dividends  scheduled debt requirements  obligations under arrangements relating to the partnership parks and common stock repurchases 
our current and future liquidity is greatly dependent upon our operating results  which are driven largely by overall economic conditions as well as the price and perceived quality of the entertainment experience at our parks 
our liquidity could also be adversely affected by a disruption in the availability of credit as well as unfavorable weather  contagious diseases  such as swine or avian flu  accidents or the occurrence of an event or condition at our parks  including terrorist acts or threats  negative publicity or significant local competitive events  that could significantly reduce paid attendance and  therefore  revenue at any of our parks 
while we work with local police authorities on security related precautions to prevent certain types of disturbances  we can make no assurance that these precautions 
table of contents will be able to prevent these types of occurrences 
however  we believe that our ownership of many parks in different geographic locations reduces the effects of adverse weather or these other types of occurrences on our consolidated results 
if such an adverse event were to occur  we may be unable to borrow under the new revolving loan or be required to repay amounts outstanding under the new credit facility and or may need to seek additional financing 
in addition  we expect that we may be required to refinance all or a significant portion of our existing debt on or prior to maturity and potentially seek additional financing 
the degree to which we are leveraged could adversely affect our ability to obtain any additional financing

risk factors contained in this annual report on form k 
as of december   our total indebtedness  net of discount  was approximately million 
based on i non revolving credit debt outstanding on that date  ii anticipated levels of working capital revolving borrowings during  and iii estimated interest rates for floating rate debt  we anticipate annual cash interest payments will aggregate million for under the new credit facility  approximately of the new term loans are not due until december we currently plan on spending approximately of revenues on capital expenditures for the calendar year 
as of december   we had approximately million of unrestricted cash and million available for borrowing under the new revolving loan 
our ability to borrow under the new revolving loan is dependent upon compliance with certain conditions  including a maximum senior leverage maintenance covenant and a minimum interest coverage covenant and the absence of any material adverse change in our business or financial condition 
if we were to become unable to borrow under the new revolving loan  we would likely be unable to pay in full our off season obligations 
a default under the new revolving loan could permit the lenders under the new credit facility to accelerate the obligations thereunder 
the new revolving loan expires on december  the terms and availability of the new credit facility and other indebtedness are not affected by changes in the ratings issued by rating agencies in respect of our indebtedness

since our business is both seasonal in nature and involves significant levels of cash transactions  our net operating cash flows are largely driven by attendance and per capita spending levels because much of our cash based expenses are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with either attendance or per capita spending 
these cash based operating expenses include salaries and wages  employee benefits  advertising  third party services  repairs and maintenance  utilities and insurance

see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our pension benefit and k plans 
the vast majority of our capital expenditures in and beyond will be made on a discretionary basis 
we plan on spending approximately of revenues on capital expenditures for all of our operations in the season 
we maintain insurance of the type and in amounts that we believe is commercially reasonable and that is available to businesses in our industry 
see insurance under item business 
our insurance premiums and self insurance retention levels have remained relatively constant during the three year 
table of contents period ending december  we cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage  the level of any self insurance retention applicable thereto  the level of aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks 
we are party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
see legal proceedings for information on certain significant litigation 
we may from time to time seek to retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on the prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
market risks and sensitivity analyses like other companies  we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the objective of our financial risk management is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our operations  cash flows and equity 
we do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
in february  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted million of the term loan component under our prepetition credit agreement into a fixed rate obligation 
the terms of the agreements  each of which had a notional amount of million  began in february and were scheduled to expire in february our prepetition term loan borrowings bore interest based upon libor plus a fixed margin 
under our interest rate swap arrangements  our interest rates ranged from to with an average of 
as a result of the chapter filing  the interest rate swap agreements were terminated by our counterparties and we recorded a million loss in other expense in on the effective date  we settled all obligations under the interest rate swaps 
as a result of fresh start accounting  the remaining accumulated other comprehensive income balance was eliminated and recorded as part of the reorganization items 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our interest rate swaps 
the following analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value  operations and cash flows of our market risk financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest rates as if these changes occurred at december  the range of potential change in the market chosen for this analysis reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the interest rate assumptions 
these forward looking disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of these changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   we had total debt of million  of which million represents fixed rate debt and the balance represents floating rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact book value  operations or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future operations and cash flows  assuming other factors remain constant 
assuming other variables remain constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels  the pre tax operating and cash flow impact resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately million

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting for variable interest entities 
this update changes the consolidation guidance applicable to a variable interest entity 
it also amends the guidance governing the determination of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  and is  therefore  required to consolidate an entity  by requiring a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative analysis 
the qualitative analysis will include  among other things  consideration of who has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the variable interest entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
this standard also requires continuous reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
previously  the applicable guidance required reconsideration of whether an enterprise was the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity only when specific events had occurred 
qualifying special purpose entities  which were previously exempt from the application of this standard  will be subject to the provisions of this standard when it becomes effective 
this update also requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with a variable interest entity 
the new guidance is effective as of the beginning of interim and annual reporting periods that begin after november  we adopted the new guidance at january  as a result of adopting this update  we consolidated hwp development  llc joint venture as of january   which resulted in a million and a million increase in our assets and liabilities  respectively 
the equity interests owned by non affiliated parties in hwp are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as noncontrolling interest 
the portion of earnings attributable to the non affiliated parties is reflected as net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for periods ended december   december  and april  the adoption of this updated amendment did not change the accounting treatment of the partnerships that own sfot and sfog  which we continued to consolidate
