item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
for purposes of reviewing this document  segment profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests excluding corporate general and administrative expense  interest expense  interest income  domestic and foreign income taxes  and other non operating income and expense items 
for a reconciliation of segment profit to earnings before taxes  see operations by business segment and geographical area in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations summary of overall company results consolidated revenue for increased percent to a record billion from billion for principally due to substantial growth in the mining and metals business line of the industrial infrastructure segment  as well as revenue growth in the oil gas  government and global services segments 
this revenue growth was partially offset by the significant revenue decline in the power segment in consolidated revenue for decreased five percent to billion from billion for primarily due to a significant revenue decline in the oil gas segment which was partially offset by large revenue increases in the industrial infrastructure and government segments 
the generally sluggish global economy and the uncertain economic conditions in europe and other markets have resulted in a highly competitive business environment that has continued to put increased pressure on margins 
this trend is expected to continue and  in certain cases  may result in more lump sum project execution for the company 
in some instances  margins are being negatively impacted by the change in the mix of work performed eg  a higher mix of construction related work and a higher content of customer furnished materials  which typically generate lower margins than engineering work or projects without customer furnished materials 
earnings before taxes for increased percent to billion from million in earnings for the period increased primarily due to a reduced level of project charges compared to during  the company recorded significant charges for two infrastructure projects  both discussed in more detail in industrial infrastructure below 
first  for the greater gabbard offshore wind farm greater gabbard project  a billion lump sum project to provide engineering  procurement and construction services for the client s offshore wind farm project in the united kingdom  charges totaling million were taken in for estimated cost overruns for a variety of execution challenges that 
table of contents impacted the schedule and project cost forecast  including material and equipment delivery issues  productivity issues  the bankruptcy of a major subcontractor and weather related delays 
the company also recorded a charge of million during the prior year after an adverse bankruptcy court ruling on the priority of claims made by its joint venture against a bankrupt client entity for a completed million fixed price infrastructure joint venture project near san diego  california 
during  the company recorded additional charges for the greater gabbard project totaling million  primarily due to increased costs associated with the installation of subsea cable and schedule delays related to adverse weather conditions 
the results were also positively impacted by improved performance in the mining and metals business line of the industrial infrastructure segment and the global services segment  offset somewhat by lower earnings in the power and oil gas segments 
earnings before taxes were million in  down from billion in the decrease in earnings for was primarily due to the impact of charges totaling million for the greater gabbard project and a charge totaling million for the completed infrastructure joint venture project in california 
some of the impact of the charges for the greater gabbard project and the infrastructure joint venture project was offset by improved performance in on other industrial infrastructure projects in the infrastructure and mining and metals business lines 
the results were also impacted by the lower volume and associated earnings in the oil gas segment due to reduced project execution activities as a number of large projects that were awarded in through had been completed or were near completion 
in addition  the earnings of the segment were impacted by slower new award activity during and the first half of related to the global recession  a decline in the demand for new capacity in the refining  petrochemical and polysilicon markets  and a highly competitive business environment that resulted from changed market conditions 
improved performance was noted in the government  global services and power segments for the improvement in the government segment was primarily the result of a higher level of project execution activities to support the united states army in afghanistan 
the global services segment s increase in profitability in compared to the prior year was primarily because the period included a million charge related to the uncollectability of a client receivable for a paper mill project 
the power segment contributed higher earnings during compared to the prior year mostly due to higher contributions from the oak grove coal fired power project and a gas fired power plant  both in texas 
these positive results in the power segment were offset somewhat by charges of million taken in on a gas fired power project in georgia for estimated additional costs to complete the project 
the company reported lower corporate general and administrative expense in when compared to  primarily as a result of overhead reduction efforts and lower management incentive compensation 
the effective tax rate was percent  percent and percent for  and  respectively 
the rate was favorably impacted by the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of various disputed items 
the lower rate was primarily attributable to a million tax benefit that resulted from a worthless stock deduction for the tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary in the fourth quarter  partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance associated with net operating losses 
factors affecting the effective tax rates for are discussed further under corporate  tax and other matters below 
net earnings attributable to fluor corporation were per diluted share in compared to and per diluted share in and  respectively 
net earnings attributable to fluor corporation in reflected the additional pre tax charges of million per diluted share for the greater gabbard project noted above 
net earnings attributable to fluor corporation in included the negative impact of the following pre tax charges previously discussed million per diluted share for the greater gabbard project  million per diluted share for the completed infrastructure joint venture project in california  and million per diluted share for the gas fired power project in georgia 
net earnings attributable to fluor corporation in also included the million per diluted share tax benefit described above for the tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary in the fourth quarter 
a significant portion of this tax benefit resulted from the financial impact of the greater gabbard project charges on the foreign subsidiary 
net earnings attributable to fluor 
table of contents corporation in included a million per diluted share pre tax charge for the uncollectability of the paper mill project receivable in the global services segment noted above 
consolidated new awards for were billion compared to billion in and billion in new award activity in and were driven by the strength of the mining and metals business line in the industrial infrastructure segment and the oil gas segment 
the lower level of new awards in was primarily attributable to the global recession  though the oil gas and industrial infrastructure segments were still the principal drivers of the new award activity for the company 
approximately percent of consolidated new awards for were for projects located outside of the united states 
consolidated backlog was billion as of december   billion as of december   and billion as of december  the increase in backlog during and was due to the strength of the new award activity noted above in the industrial infrastructure and oil gas segments 
backlog was lower at the end of primarily because of the impact of the global recession on new award activity  as well as certain project cancellations and scope reductions attributable to the global credit crisis and falling oil prices 
the industrial infrastructure and oil gas segments made up the vast majority of backlog for all three years  but at lower levels in compared to both and as of december   approximately percent of consolidated backlog related to projects located outside of the united states 
for a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment  corporate general and administrative expense and other items  see segment operations and corporate  tax and other matters below 
discussion of critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and  accordingly  actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates 
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements apply to the following critical accounting policies engineering and construction contracts contract revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost 
contracts are generally segmented between types of services  such as engineering and construction  and accordingly  gross margin related to each activity is recognized as those separate services are rendered 
the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of cost to complete for contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials  labor cost and productivity  the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards 
changes in total estimated contract cost and losses  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
pre contract costs are expensed as incurred 
the majority of the company s engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of cost plus a fixed or percentage fee 
as of december   percent of the company s backlog was cost reimbursable while percent was for fixed price  lump sum  guaranteed maximum or unit price contracts 
in certain instances  the company provides guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria 
failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees could result in unrealized incentive fees or liquidated damages 
in addition  increases in contract cost can result in non recoverable cost which could exceed revenue realized from the projects 

table of contents claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients  and the company has made claims against clients for cost incurred in excess of current contract provisions 
the company recognizes revenue  but not profit  for certain significant claims when it is determined that recovery of incurred cost is probable and the amounts can be reliably estimated 
under accounting standards codification asc  these requirements are satisfied when the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim  additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and not the result of deficiencies in the company s performance  claim related costs are identifiable and considered reasonable in view of the work performed  and evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 
recognized claims against clients amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
cost  but not profit  associated with unapproved change orders is accounted for in revenue when it is probable that the cost will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
in circumstances where recovery is considered probable  but the revenue cannot be reliably estimated  cost attributable to change orders is deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price 
if the requirements for recognizing revenue for claims or unapproved change orders are met  revenue is recorded only to the extent that costs associated with the claims or unapproved change orders have been incurred 
backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress 
although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm  cancellations or scope adjustments may occur 
backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations  revisions to project scope and cost  and deferrals  as appropriate 
engineering and construction partnerships and joint ventures certain contracts are executed jointly through partnership and joint venture arrangements with unrelated third parties 
generally  these arrangements are characterized by a percent or less ownership interest that requires only a small initial investment 
the arrangements are often formed for the single business purpose of executing a specific project and allow the company to share risks and or secure specialty skills required for project execution 
the company evaluates at inception each partnership and joint venture to determine if it qualifies as a variable interest entity vie under asc a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors who are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
the majority of the company s partnerships and joint ventures qualify as vies because the total equity investment is typically nominal and not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
upon the occurrence of certain events outlined in asc  the company reassesses its initial determination of whether the partnership or joint venture is a vie 
the company also evaluates whether it is the primary beneficiary of each vie and consolidates the vie if the company has both the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses of  or the right to receive benefits from  the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
the company considers the contractual agreements that define the ownership structure  distribution of profits and losses  risks  responsibilities  indebtedness  voting rights and board representation of the respective parties in determining whether it qualifies as the primary beneficiary 
the company also considers all parties that have direct or implicit variable interests when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary 
in most cases  the company does not qualify as the primary beneficiary 
when the company is determined to be the primary beneficiary  the vie is consolidated 
as required by asc  management s assessment of whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie is continuously performed 
for joint ventures and partnerships in the construction industry  unless full consolidation is required  the company generally recognizes its proportionate share of revenue  cost and segment profit in its consolidated statement of earnings and uses the one line equity method of accounting in the consolidated balance sheet  as allowed under asc at times  the cost and equity methods of accounting are also used  depending on the company s respective ownership interest  amount of influence 
table of contents in the vie and other factors 
the most significant application of the proportionate consolidation method is in the oil gas  industrial infrastructure and government segments 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests 
interim testing for impairment is performed if indicators of potential impairment exist 
for purposes of impairment testing  goodwill is allocated to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure 
when testing goodwill for impairment  the company first compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment 
in the second step  the company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized 
during  the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests in the first quarter and determined that none of the goodwill was impaired because the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying amount 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
interim testing for impairment is performed if indicators of potential impairment exist 
an intangible asset with an indefinite life is impaired if its carrying value exceeds its fair value 
as of december   none of the company s intangible assets with indefinite lives were impaired 
intangible assets with finite lives arise from business acquisitions and are amortized on a straight line basis over the useful lives of those assets  ranging from one to ten years 
deferred taxes and tax contingencies deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
as of december   the company had deferred tax assets of million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of million 
the valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
the allowance for primarily relates to the deferred tax assets on certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for us and us subsidiaries and certain reserves on investments 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate on future earnings 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized 
income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
the company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within its global operations in income tax expense 
retirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as amended by sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans asc 
as required by asc  the unfunded or overfunded projected benefit obligation is recognized in the company s financial statements 
assumptions concerning discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period 
the company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations and other factors 
assuming no changes in current assumptions  the company expects to fund between million and million for the calendar year  
table of contents which is expected to be in excess of the minimum funding required 
if the discount rates were reduced by basis points  plan liabilities for the us and us plans would increase by approximately million and million  respectively 
segment operations the company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering  procurement  construction  maintenance and project management 
the company is organized into five business segments oil gas  industrial infrastructure  government  global services and power 
for more information on the business segments see item business above 
oil gas revenue and segment profit for the oil gas segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit revenue in increased three percent compared to primarily because of increased construction related activities  including a greater content of customer furnished materials for projects that were awarded in revenue in decreased percent compared to due to reduced project execution activities as a number of large projects that were awarded from through had been completed or were near completion 
in addition  revenue in was impacted by slower new award activity during and the first half of segment profit in decreased percent compared to primarily because the results were favorably impacted by contributions of certain large projects that were completed or nearing completion  as well as various other large projects that achieved their peak earnings that year 
in addition  segment profit was favorably impacted by the successful resolution of some disputed items and the expiration of certain warranty obligations 
segment profit in decreased percent compared to due to the reduced project execution activities and reduced new awards  noted above  that also caused the decline in revenue in in addition  segment profit in included the net positive impact of close out issues for certain projects nearing completion  with the approval of change orders and the successful resolution of disputed items 
segment profit margin was percent in compared to percent in and percent in the reduction in segment profit margin for compared to was primarily due to a shift in the mix of work from higher margin engineering activities to lower margin construction activities  with a corresponding higher content of customer furnished materials 
the successful resolution of some disputed items and the expiration of certain warranty obligations in also contributed to the higher segment profit margin in  relative to segment profit margin was higher in than in both and primarily due to the aforementioned net positive impact of close out issues in for certain projects nearing completion 
segment profit margin in and was also negatively impacted by lower operating leverage with the contraction of business volume  along with a more competitive business environment 
new awards in the oil gas segment were billion in  billion in and billion in new awards in included a billion grassroots petrochemicals complex in the middle east and upstream services associated with a major open pit mine relocation project in canada valued at billion 
new awards in included upstream services associated with a liquefied natural gas project in australia valued at billion and billion for an oil sands program in canada 
new awards in included billion for a canadian oil sands program and also an expansion to an onshore production facility in russia 

table of contents backlog for the oil gas segment was billion as of december  compared to billion as of december  and billion as of december  from through  the segment participated in an expanding market that included very large project awards in diverse geographic locations  which were well suited to the company s global execution and project management capabilities and strong financial position 
the global recession  changing market conditions and a decline in demand for new capacity in the refining  petrochemical and polysilicon markets resulted in lower new award activity in and the first half of  as well as billion of project cancellations and scope reductions during as a consequence of this lower level of new award activity and the project cancellations and scope reductions  the segment s and revenue and segment profit declined when compared to although the market conditions for the segment have improved somewhat since the recession  a highly competitive business environment has resulted in significant pressure on margins 
it is anticipated that these market conditions will continue and that the highly competitive business environment could result in continued margin pressures and more lump sum project execution for the segment 
total assets in the segment were billion as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  the higher level of total assets in compared to and was primarily to meet working capital requirements to support project execution activities 
industrial infrastructure revenue and segment profit for the industrial infrastructure segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit loss revenue in increased percent compared to  and revenue in increased percent from  primarily due to substantial growth in the mining and metals business line 
segment profit and segment profit margin increased significantly in compared to primarily because the prior year included the impact of significant charges for two infrastructure projects 
for the greater gabbard project  charges totaling million were taken in for estimated cost overruns for a variety of execution challenges that impacted the schedule and project cost forecast  including material and equipment delivery issues  productivity issues  the bankruptcy of a major subcontractor and weather related delays 
the segment also recorded a charge of million during the prior year third quarter after an adverse bankruptcy court ruling on the priority of claims made by its joint venture against a bankrupt client entity for a completed million fixed price infrastructure joint venture project near san diego  california 
as a result of the ruling  the company determined that the likelihood of recovering cost overruns resulting from owner directed scope changes was no longer considered probable 
during  the segment recorded additional charges for the greater gabbard project totaling million  primarily due to increased costs associated with the installation of subsea cable and schedule delays related to adverse weather conditions 
challenges in the cable installation process have been compounded by the bankruptcy of a critical subcontractor in january which forced the project to secure alternative vessels and equipment 
the project forecast has been revised for the cost overruns and the company has taken a number of actions to mitigate further cost growth 
the charges for the greater gabbard project were offset by positive contributions from other projects in the segment during the year  including million for forecast adjustments due to the achievement of progress milestones on two infrastructure road projects  million from the closeout of an infrastructure project  million of costs recovered in a settlement with the bankrupt client for the above referenced fixed price infrastructure joint venture project  and million related to the favorable resolution of certain disputed items and the achievement of incentive targets on a mining project 
segment 
table of contents profit in was also favorably impacted by a significantly higher level of project execution activities related to the growth in the mining and metals business line  noted above 
segment profit and segment profit margin declined significantly in compared to due to the impact of significant charges for the greater gabbard project and the fixed price infrastructure joint venture project  discussed above 
the charges for these two projects were offset somewhat by positive contributions from other projects in the segment during the year  including million of fees earned at financial closing for an infrastructure rail project  million for the final negotiated settlement and closeout of both an infrastructure road project and an infrastructure telecommunications project  and million for the approval of a significant change order for another infrastructure road project 
in addition  there were increased contributions in segment profit in when compared to due to a significantly higher level of project execution activities related to the growth in the mining and metals business line  noted above 
the company is involved in a dispute in connection with the greater gabbard project 
the dispute relates to the company s claim for additional compensation for schedule and cost impacts arising from delays in the fabrication of monopiles and transition pieces  along with certain disruption and productivity issues associated with construction activities and weather related delays 
the company believes the schedule and cost impacts are attributable to the client and other third parties 
as of december   the company had recorded million of claim revenue related to this issue for costs incurred to date 
additional costs arising from this dispute are expected to be incurred during the remaining life of the project and  as a result  claim revenue will increase accordingly 
the company believes the ultimate recovery of incurred and future costs is probable under asc the company will continue to periodically evaluate its position and the amount recognized in revenue with respect to this claim 
the project is expected to be substantially complete by the second quarter of however  the resolution of the claims is expected to extend beyond the completion date of the project 
as of december   the client had also previously withheld the contractual maximum for liquidated damages related to the dispute of approximately million 
the company will also seek to recover in arbitration a significant portion of the withheld liquidated damages 
should the company not be successful in its pursuit of schedule relief related to certain delays covered by the claim  the liquidated damages not recovered from the client could result in a charge to earnings  as would any unrecovered claim amounts 
new awards in the industrial infrastructure segment were billion during  billion during and billion during new awards in were primarily attributable to the mining and metals business line  and included billion for ongoing iron ore work in australia  as well as a major copper project in peru 
the increased new award activity in was primarily attributable to the mining and metals business line  with significant contributions from the infrastructure business line 
the new awards in included an aluminum program in saudi arabia valued at billion  a billion copper mine in chile and billion for an infrastructure rail project in the united states 
new awards during were driven by the mining and metals business line  including a billion iron ore project in australia and a billion nickel project in canada 
ending backlog for the segment increased to billion for from billion for and billion for the growth in backlog during and was driven by the substantial new award activity in the mining and metals business line 
total assets in the industrial infrastructure segment were million as of december  compared to million as of december  and million as of december  the increase in total assets in compared to was mainly due to an increase in working capital to support the growth in the mining and metals business line 
the decrease in total assets in compared to was primarily attributable to a reduction in work in process on the greater gabbard project with the installation of certain offshore materials and the write off of the investment for the fixed price infrastructure joint venture project in california 

table of contents government revenue and segment profit for the government segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit revenue in and increased percent and percent compared to and  respectively  principally due to an increase in the volume of work for the logistics civil augmentation program logcap iv for the united states army in afghanistan 
project execution activities associated with the gaseous diffusion plant contract for the department of energy in portsmouth  ohio the portsmouth project  awarded in the first quarter of  also contributed to the revenue increase  though the impact was largely offset by a reduction in revenue attributable to the close out of the american recovery and reinvestment act arra funded work at the savannah river site management and operating project the savannah river project in south carolina and the completion of many task orders for the us army corps of engineers transatlantic programs center cetac logistics program in iraq 
revenue growth in for the savannah river project and arra funded work at the savannah river project site was offset by a decrease in revenue at the hanford environmental management project the hanford project in the state of washington  which was completed in segment profit during and increased two percent and percent compared to and  respectively  primarily due to additional contributions from higher levels of project execution activities on logcap iv task orders 
the growth in segment profit for was also attributable to the portsmouth project  though reduced contributions from cetac task orders and the arra work at savannah river more than offset its positive impact 
segment profit margin was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the higher segment profit margin in was primarily attributable to the favorable resolution of disputed items and warranty obligations for the bagram air base contract in afghanistan that resulted in the recognition of million of segment profit during the year 
new awards were billion during  billion during and billion during the increase in new award activity in was primarily attributable to the initial contract funding for the portsmouth project and increased funding for logcap iv task orders 
new awards in also included the annual funding for the savannah river project 
significant new awards for included logcap iv task orders  which drove the increase in new award activity compared to  and the annual funding for the savannah river project 
significant new awards for included the annual funding for the savannah river project  the multi year arra funding at the savannah river project site and logcap iv task orders 
the company reports new awards for logcap iv as individual task orders are awarded and funded 
backlog was billion as of december   million as of december  and billion as of december  the growth in backlog during was driven by the initial contract funding for the portsmouth project and increased funding for logcap iv task orders 
the higher backlog in compared to was primarily due to the multi year funding for arra work at the savannah river project site that was a new award in  and partially worked off by the end of total assets in the government segment were million as of december   billion as of december  and million as of december  the decrease in total assets in compared to was mainly due to a decrease in working capital related to the logcap iv task orders 
the increase in total assets in compared to corresponded to an increase in working capital to support project execution activities  particularly for logcap iv task orders 

table of contents global services revenue and segment profit for the global services segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit revenue in increased five percent compared to principally due to the equipment business line which experienced a higher volume of work in afghanistan and south america 
a decrease in current year revenue attributable to the close out of the gulf coast oil spill cleanup project in was offset by an increase in other operations and maintenance business line project execution activities and an increase in revenue in the temporary staffing business line 
revenue decreased four percent during compared to the prior year primarily due to the reduction in the equipment business line s iraq business activities 
this revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in revenue related to the gulf coast oil spill cleanup in the operations and maintenance business line 
segment profit during increased percent compared to  primarily due to the improved performance from the equipment business line  as noted above 
increased segment profit in the current year from the temporary staffing business line was offset by a decrease in contributions from the operations and maintenance business line  the latter of which was primarily the result of the close out of the gulf coast oil spill cleanup project in the prior year 
segment profit during increased percent compared to primarily because included a million charge related to the uncollectability of a client receivable for a paper mill where the company s scope of work was to recommission  start up and operate the facility 
segment profit in benefitted from the gulf coast oil spill cleanup activities  though the resulting positive contribution was more than offset by the overall weak economic conditions impacting all business lines  including the continued delay and reduction in capital work and maintenance activities in the operations and maintenance business line and reduced activity in the domestic and european operations of the temporary staffing business line 
segment profit margin was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and segment profit margin for was higher compared to due to improvement in margins in the equipment business line s activities in afghanistan and south america 
the lower segment profit margin was due to the factors that impacted segment profit noted above  particularly the charge related to the write off of the uncollectable receivable for the paper mill project 
new awards in the global services segment were billion during  billion during and million during the operations and maintenance business line continues to experience lower volume with existing clients  as well as delayed new client releases 
new awards for all three years included new work and renewals for key clients  such as ibm all years  alcoa all years  procter gamble all years and sapref of south africa 
backlog for the global services segment was billion as of december   billion as of december  and billion as of december  operations and maintenance activities that have yet to be performed comprise global services backlog 
short duration operations and maintenance activities may not contribute to ending backlog 
in addition  the equipment  temporary staffing and supply chain solutions business lines do not report backlog or new awards 
total assets in the global services segment were million as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  the increase in the segment s total assets in corresponded to an increase in working capital and equipment to support the equipment business line 
the increase in total assets in was due to an increase in working capital to support projects in the operations and maintenance business line  additional working capital to support ongoing equipment transactions and an expansion of the equipment fleet to support long term agreements 

table of contents power revenue and segment profit for the power segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit revenue in decreased percent compared to primarily due to the expected reduction in project execution activities on several projects which have reached or are near final completion  including the oak grove coal fired power project in texas for luminant  a unit of energy future holdings corporation  gas fired power plants in texas and virginia  and pre construction services on a nuclear new build project in texas  as well as reduced volume on certain other projects progressing toward completion 
the segment s revenue decreased five percent in compared to primarily due to the reduction in project execution activities on the oak grove project which reached final completion in also in  revenue increases associated with project execution activities on gas fired power plant projects located in texas  virginia and georgia were largely offset by a decline in revenue due to reduced volume on various other projects progressing toward completion 
segment profit during decreased percent compared to principally due to reduced contributions from the oak grove project 
the reduced contributions from other projects nearing completion  including the gas fired power plant project in texas  pre construction services on the nuclear new build project in texas and an emissions control retrofit project in south carolina  were offset by lower charges taken for cost overruns on the gas fired power plant project in georgia million during compared to million in and improved performance on the gas fired power plant project in virginia due to the achievement of major milestones 
segment profit in increased eight percent compared to primarily due to increased contributions from the oak grove project as a result of reaching final completion and acceptance and achieving contractual performance guarantees  along with improved performance from the gas fired power plant project in texas 
these positive results were partially offset by the charges taken in on the gas fired power project in georgia  noted above 
segment profit margin in the power segment was percent  percent and percent for  and  respectively 
the fluctuations in segment profit margin from year to year are explained by the same factors that impacted revenue and segment profit  discussed above 
the power segment continues to be impacted by relatively weak demand for new power generation 
improving market opportunities include gas fired baseload generation  renewable energy  regional transmission additions and air emissions compliance projects for existing coal fired power plants 
new awards in the power segment are typically large in amount and occur on an irregular basis 
new awards of billion in included an air emissions control construction program for luminant  a new gas fired power plant project in texas  and a new solar power project in arizona 
new awards of million in included work for nuclear preconstruction services and the renewal of the luminant system wide fossil maintenance program in texas 
new awards of billion in included a gas fired plant in virginia and nuclear preconstruction services 
backlog was billion as of december   million as of december  and billion as of december  the increase in backlog in was principally driven by the new awards mentioned in the preceding paragraph which were awarded in the latter part of the year 
the decline in backlog in was primarily because the work performed on the oak grove project  major gas fired power plant projects in texas  virginia and georgia  and certain other projects was not replaced by new award activity of equal or greater value 
total assets in the power segment were million as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  the increase in the segment s total assets in was attributable to an increase in work in process for the purchase of certain solar power plant 
table of contents equipment in advance of customer reimbursement and the consolidation of the assets of nuscale power  a small modular nuclear reactor technology company that the company acquired a majority interest in during late the decrease in the segment s total assets in was due to a reduction in working capital for project execution activities  including the oak grove project 
corporate  tax and other matters corporate for the three years ended december   and  corporate general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  respectively

the performance guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances 
the maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts 
amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated cost to complete contracts in progress are not estimable 
for cost reimbursable contracts  amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract 
for lump sum or fixed price contracts  the performance guarantee amount is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash and marketable securities are deposited with major banks throughout the world

the company s historical gains and losses associated with derivative instruments have been immaterial 
the company s long term debt obligations carry a fixed rate coupon and its exposure to interest rate risk is not material due to the low interest rates on these obligations
