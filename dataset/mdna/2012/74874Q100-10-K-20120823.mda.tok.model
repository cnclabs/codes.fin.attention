management overview quinstreet is a leader in vertical marketing and media online 
we have built a strong set of capabilities to engage internet visitors with targeted media and to connect our marketing clients with their potential customers online 
we focus on serving clients in large  information intensive industry verticals where relevant  targeted media and offerings help visitors make informed choices  find the products that match their needs  and thus become qualified customer prospects for our clients 
we deliver cost effective marketing results to our clients most typically in the form of a qualified lead or inquiry  or in the form of a click 
these leads or clicks can then convert into a customer or sale for clients at a rate that results in an acceptable marketing cost to them 
we are typically paid by clients when we deliver qualified leads or clicks as defined by our agreements with them 
we bear the costs of media  thus our programs must deliver value to our clients and provide for a media yield  or margin on our media costs  that provides a sound financial outcome for us 
our general process is we own or access targeted media  we run advertisements or other forms of marketing messages and programs in that media to create visitor responses or clicks through to client offerings  we match these responses or clicks to client offerings that meet visitor interests or needs  converting visitors into qualified leads or clicks  and we optimize client matches and media yield such that we achieve desired results for clients and a sound financial outcome for us 
our primary financial objective has been and remains creating revenue growth from sustainable sources  at target levels of profitability 
our primary financial objective is not to maximize profits  but rather to achieve target levels of profitability while investing in various growth initiatives  as we believe we are in the early stages of a large  long term market 
our direct marketing services  or dms  business accounted for substantially all of our net revenue in fiscal years  and our dms business derives its net revenue from fees earned through the delivery of qualified leads and clicks and  to a lesser extent  display advertisement  or impressions 
through a vertical focus  targeted media presence and our technology platform  we are able to deliver targeted  measurable marketing results to our clients 
our two largest client verticals are financial services and education 
our financial services client vertical represented  and of net revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our education client vertical represented  and of net revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
other dms client verticals  consisting primarily of business to business technology  home services and medical  represented  and of net revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in addition  we derived less than of our net revenue in fiscal years  and from our direct selling services  or dss  business 
we generated substantially all of our revenue from sales to clients in the united states 

table of contents trends affecting our business client verticals to date  we have generated the majority of our revenue from clients in our education and financial services client verticals 
we expect that a majority of our revenue in fiscal year will be generated from clients in these two client verticals 
our education client vertical has been significantly affected by the adoption of regulations affecting for profit educational institutions over the past several years 
the regulations have affected and are expected to continue to affect our clients businesses and marketing practices  including an overall decrease in our clients external marketing expenditures and a related decrease in our revenues from this client vertical 
the effect of these regulations may continue to result in fluctuations in the volume and mix of our business with these clients 
in our financial services client vertical  prices are largely determined by bidding 
in fiscal year  we have seen pricing that we receive from clients stabilize 
throughout the year  our revenue has declined primarily due to volume declines caused by losses of traffic from third party publishers resulting from acquisitions of media sources by competitors  changes in a search engine s algorithms which reduced or eliminated traffic from some third party publishers  and increased competition for quality media 
acquisitions acquisitions in fiscal year in february  we acquired certain assets of ziff davis enterprise from enterprise media group  inc  a new york based online media and marketing company in the business to business technology market  in exchange for million in cash  to broaden our registered user database and brand name in the business to business technology market 
in august  we acquired of the outstanding equity interests of narrowcast group  llc  or it businessedge  a kentucky based internet media company in the business to business technology market  in exchange for million in cash  to broaden our registered user database and media access in the business to business technology market 
during fiscal year  in addition to certain assets of ziff davis enterprise and all of the equity interests of it businessedge  we acquired eleven other online publishing businesses 
acquisitions in fiscal year in november  we acquired of the outstanding shares of car insurance 
com  inc  or carinsurance 
com  a florida based online insurance business  and certain of its affiliated companies  in exchange for million in cash  for its capacity to generate online visitors in the financial services market

table of contents life quotes  inc  or insure

during fiscal year  in addition to the acquisitions of internet 
com and insure 
com  we acquired other online publishing businesses 
our acquisition strategy may result in significant fluctuations in our available working capital from period to period and over the years 
we may use cash  stock or promissory notes to acquire various businesses or technologies  and we cannot accurately predict the timing of those acquisitions or the impact on our cash flows and balance sheet 
large acquisitions or multiple acquisitions within a particular period may significantly affect our financial results for that period 
we may utilize debt financing to make acquisitions  which could give rise to higher interest expense and more restrictive operating covenants 
we may also utilize our stock as consideration  which could result in substantial dilution 
development  retention and acquisition of targeted media one of the primary challenges of our business is finding  retaining and developing media that is targeted enough to attract prospects for our clients at costs that work for our business model 
in order to grow our business  we must be able to continue to find  develop and retain quality targeted media on a cost effective basis 
our inability to find  develop and retain high quality targeted media has limited  during some periods  and may continue to limit our growth 
seasonality our results are subject to significant fluctuation as a result of seasonality 
in particular  our quarters ending december our second fiscal quarter typically demonstrate seasonal weakness 
in our second fiscal quarters  there is lower availability of cost effective media during the holiday period and some of our clients request fewer leads due to holiday staffing 
in our quarters ending march our third fiscal quarter  this trend generally reverses with better lead availability and often new budgets at the beginning of the year for our clients with fiscal years ending december basis of presentation general we operate in two segments dms and dss 
for further discussion and financial information about our reporting segments  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
net revenue dms 
our dms business generates revenue from fees earned through the delivery of qualified leads  clicks and  to a lesser extent  display advertisements  or impressions 
we deliver targeted and measurable results through a vertical focus that we classify into the following client verticals financial services  education and other which includes business to business technology  home services and medical 
dss 
our dss business generated less than of net revenue in fiscal years  and from the provision of a hosted solution and related services for clients in the direct selling industry 
we expect dss to continue to represent an immaterial portion of our business

personnel costs include salaries  stock based compensation expense  bonuses and employee benefit costs 
personnel costs are primarily related to individuals associated with maintaining our servers and websites  our editorial staff  client management  creative team  compliance group and media purchasing analysts 
costs associated with software incurred in the development phase or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the software s estimated useful life

see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our deferred tax assets 
selected quarterly financial data the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for the eight quarters ended june  we have prepared the statements of operations for each of these quarters on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and  in the opinion of management  each statement of operations includes all adjustments  consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for the fair statement of the results of operations for these periods 
this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

table of contents adjusted ebitda our use of adjusted ebitda 
we include adjusted ebitda in this report because i we seek to manage our business to a consistent level of adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenue  ii it is a key basis upon which our management assesses our operating performance  iii it is one of the primary metrics investors use in evaluating internet marketing companies  iv it is a factor in the evaluation of the performance of our management in determining compensation  and v it is an element of certain financial covenants under our debt agreements 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income less provision for taxes  depreciation expense  amortization expense  stock based compensation expense  interest and other income expense  net 
we use adjusted ebitda as a key performance measure because we believe it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense  tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or fluctuations in permanent differences or discrete quarterly items and the non cash impact of depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense 
because adjusted ebitda facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis  we also use adjusted ebitda for business planning purposes  to incentivize and compensate our management personnel and in evaluating acquisition opportunities 
in addition  we believe adjusted ebitda and similar measures are widely used by investors  securities analysts  ratings agencies and other interested parties in our industry as a measure of financial performance and debt service capabilities 
our use of adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing stock based compensation to our management team and employees  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness  adjusted ebitda does not reflect certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us  and other companies  including companies in our industry  may calculate adjusted ebitda measures differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure 
due to these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
when evaluating our performance  adjusted ebitda should be considered alongside other financial performance measures  including various cash flow metrics  net income and our other gaap results 

table of contents the following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income  the most comparable gaap measure  for each of the periods indicated three months ended june  mar  dec  sept  june  mar  dec  sept  in thousands net income interest and other income expense  net provision for taxes depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue adjusted ebitda quarterly trends 
we seek to manage our business to a consistent level of adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenue 
we do so on a fiscal year basis by varying our operations to balance revenue growth and costs throughout the fiscal year 
we do not seek to manage our business to a consistent level of adjusted ebitda on a quarterly basis and investors should expect our adjusted ebitda margins to vary from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity as of june  consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million  short term marketable securities of million  cash we expect to generate from operations  and our million revolving credit facility  which is committed until november  all of which is available to be drawn  subject to compliance with applicable covenants 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of days or less at the time of purchase 
we believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible 
in november  we replaced our existing million credit facility with a new credit facility that expanded our overall borrowing capacity by million to million  consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
additionally  in november  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing us to repurchase up to million  excluding broker commissions  of our outstanding shares of common stock 
through june   we have repurchased an aggregate of million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of million 
as of june   the remaining amount available for the repurchase of our common stock under this program was million  all of which was used for repurchases in july additionally  in august  we acquired of the outstanding equity interests of narrowcast group  llc  or it businessedge  a kentucky based internet media company in the business to business technology market  in exchange for million in cash 
in february  we acquired certain assets of ziff davis enterprise from enterprise media group  inc  a new york based online media and marketing company in the business to business technology market  for million in cash 
our short term and long term liquidity requirements primarily arise from our working capital requirements  acquisitions from time to time and share repurchases 
our primary operating cash requirements include the payment of media costs  personnel costs  costs of information technology systems and office facilities 
our 
table of contents ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows  which are determined by future operating performance and are  therefore  subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  and also our ability to access our credit facility 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  cash generated from operations and our available borrowings under the credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next months 
our ability to service any indebtedness we have incurred or may incur  including under our current credit facility  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to obtain additional debt or equity securities or draw down on or increase our borrowing capacity under our current credit facility for other reasons 
fiscal year ended june  in thousands cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by operating activities our net cash provided by operating activities is primarily the result of our net income adjusted for non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense and changes in working capital components  and is influenced by the timing of cash collections from our clients and cash payments for purchases of media and other expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was due to net income of million  non cash depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense and related tax benefits of million  a decrease in other noncurrent assets comprised primarily of deferred taxes of million  partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is due to timing of payments and decreased cost of revenue associated with decreased revenue 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets is primarily due to timing of payments 
the increase in accounts receivable is attributable to timing of receipts 
the decrease in deferred taxes is due to larger temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of certain existing assets and liabilities

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations relate primarily to borrowings under the credit facility  acquisition related promissory notes and operating leases 
the following table sets forth payments due under our contractual obligations as of june  year ending june  promissory notes credit facility operating leases total and thereafter total the above table does not include approximately million of long term income tax liabilities for uncertainty in income taxes due to the fact that we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of these potential future payments 
credit facility on november   we replaced our existing million credit facility with a new million credit facility 
the new facility consists of a million five year term loan  with annual principal amortization of    and  and a million five year revolving credit line 
borrowings under the credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
interest is payable at specified margins above either the eurodollar margin or the prime rate 
the interest rate varies dependent upon the ratio of funded debt to adjusted ebitda and ranges from eurodollar margin to or prime for the revolving credit line and from eurodollar margin to or prime for the term loan 
adjusted ebitda is defined as net income less provision for taxes  depreciation expense  amortization expense  stock based compensation expense  interest and other income expense  and acquisition costs for business combinations 
the interest rate margins for the new facility are less than the commensurate margins under our previous credit facility 
the revolving credit line requires a facility fee of of the revolving credit line capacity 
to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates under the term loan  on february   we entered into an interest rate swap encompassing the principal balances scheduled to be outstanding as of january  and thereafter  such principal amount totaling million on january  and amortizing to million on november  the interest rate swap effectively fixes the eurodollar margin at the credit facility expires in november the credit facility restricts our ability to raise additional debt financing and pay dividends  and also requires us to comply with other nonfinancial covenants 
in addition  we are required to maintain financial ratios computed as follows a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of  calculated as the ratio of i trailing twelve months of adjusted ebitda to ii the sum of capital expenditures  net cash interest expense  cash taxes  cash dividends 
table of contents and trailing twelve months payments of indebtedness 
payment of unsecured indebtedness is excluded to the degree that sufficient unused revolving credit line capacity exists such that the relevant debt payment could be made from the credit facility 
a maximum funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of  calculated as the ratio of i the sum of all obligations owed to lending institutions  the face amount of any letters of credit  indebtedness owed in connection with acquisition related notes and indebtedness owed in connection with capital lease obligations to ii trailing twelve months of adjusted ebitda 
we were in compliance with the covenants of our new credit facility as of june  interest rate swap we entered into an interest rate swap to reduce our exposure to the financial impact of changing interest rates under our term loan 
the effective date of the swap is april  with a maturity date of november  at june   we had approximately million of notional amount outstanding under the swap agreement that exchanges a variable interest rate base eurodollar margin for a fixed interest rate of over the term of the agreement 
this interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge of the interest rate risk attributable to forecasted variable interest payments 
the effective portion of the fair value gains or losses on this swap will be included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at june   our interest rate swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge 
for this qualifying hedge  the effective portion of the change in fair value will be recognized through earnings when the underlying transaction being hedged affects earnings  thereby allowing the swap s gains to offset interest expense from the term loan on the income statement 
any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings in the current period 
headquarters lease we entered into a lease agreement in february for approximately  square feet of office space located at tower lane  foster city  california 
the term of the lease began on november  and expires on october  the monthly base rent was abated for the first calendar months under the lease  and will remain at million through the th calendar month of the term of the lease 
after this month period  monthly base rent will increase to million for the subsequent months and then increase approximately after each month anniversary during the remaining term  including any extensions under our options to extend 
we have two options to extend the term of the lease for one additional year for each option following the expiration date of the lease or renewal term  as applicable

in doing so  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
some of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting policies listed below involve our more significant judgments  estimates and assumptions and  therefore  could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial 
table of contents statements 
in addition  we believe that a discussion of these policies is necessary to understand and evaluate the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
for further information on our critical and other significant accounting policies  see note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from two sources direct marketing services dms and direct selling services dss 
dms revenue is derived primarily from fees which are earned through the delivery of qualified leads or clicks and  to a lesser extent  display advertisements  or impressions 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery is deemed to have occurred at the time a qualified lead or click is delivered to the client provided that no significant obligations remain 
on july   as required under gaap  we adopted the amended accounting guidance for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements which provides guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated 
the adoption of this amended guidance did not have a significant impact on our revenue recognition for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the guidance requires the allocation of revenue in an arrangement using the estimated selling price esp of deliverables if vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price based on historical stand alone sales or third party evidence tpe of selling price do not exist 
due to the unique nature of some of our multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  we may not be able to establish selling prices based on historical stand alone sales or third party evidence  therefore we may use our best estimate to establish selling prices for these arrangements under the new standard 
we establish best estimates within a range of selling prices considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  factors such as class of client  size of transaction  available media inventory  pricing strategies and market conditions 
we believe the use of the best estimate of selling price allows revenue recognition in a manner consistent with the underlying economics of the transaction 
from time to time  we may agree to credit a client for certain leads or clicks if they fail to meet the contractual or other guidelines of a particular client 
we have established a sales reserve based on historical experience 
to date  such credits have been immaterial and within our expectations 
for a portion of our revenue  we have agreements with providers of online media or traffic publishers used in the generation of qualified leads or clicks 
we receive a fee from our clients and pay a fee to publishers either on a revenue share  cost per lead  cost per click or cost per thousand impressions basis 
we are the primary obligor in the transaction 
as a result  the fees paid by our clients are recognized as revenue and the fees paid to our publishers are included in cost of revenue 
dss revenue comprises i set up and professional services fees and ii usage fees 
set up and professional service fees that do not provide stand alone value to a client are recognized over the contractual term of the agreement or the expected client relationship period  whichever is longer  effective when the application reaches the go live date 
we define the go live date as the date when the application enters into a production environment or all essential functionalities have been delivered 
usage fees are recognized on a monthly basis as earned 
deferred revenue is comprised of contractual billings in excess of recognized revenue and payments received in advance of revenue recognition 

table of contents stock based compensation we measure and record the expense related to stock based transactions based on the fair values of the awards as determined on the date of grant 
for stock options  we selected and have historically used the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value 
in applying the black scholes option pricing model  our determination of fair value is affected by assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the stock options and the employees actual and projected stock option exercise and pre vesting employment termination behaviors 
since we do not have extensive trading history  we estimate the expected volatility of our common stock based on the historical volatility of comparable public companies over the stock option s expected term 
we have no history or expectation of paying cash dividends on our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield for a term consistent with the expected term of the stock options 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we recognize stock based compensation expense over the requisite service period using the straight line method  based on awards ultimately expected to vest 
we estimate future forfeitures at the date of grant and revise the estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
goodwill we conduct a test for the impairment of goodwill on at least an annual basis 
we have two reporting units  dms and dss 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in our quarter ending june   but will conduct the test at an earlier date if indicators of possible impairment arise that would cause a triggering event 
the impairment test first compares the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill  to assess whether impairment is present 
in our quarter ending june   we determined that the estimated fair value of our dms reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value 
the carrying value of our dms reporting unit was approximately million in our quarter ending june  the estimated fair value of our dms reporting unit under a market approach was approximately million in our quarter ending june  based on our market capitalization of the entire business enterprise  including a control premium  less the estimated fair value of our dss reporting unit 
this resulted in an excess of fair value over the carrying value of approximately million or 
in our quarter ending june   we determined that the estimated fair value of our dss reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value 
the carrying value of our dss reporting unit was approximately million in our quarter ending june  the estimated fair value of our dss reporting unit under an income approach was approximately million in our quarter ending june  based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
this resulted in an excess of fair value over the carrying value of approximately million or 
based on our impairment test conducted in our quarter ending june   we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill for fiscal year no impairment charges were recorded in other periods presented 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
we base these estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences could affect the estimated fair value of the reporting units and hence the valuation of goodwill could be affected 
circumstances that could affect the valuation of goodwill include  among other things  a significant change in our market capitalization  the business climate and buying habits of our subscriber base  and with respect to the dss reporting unit  the loss of a significant customer 
the application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  the assignment of assets  liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and the 
table of contents determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows and determining appropriate discount rates  growth rates  an appropriate control premium and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value which could trigger impairment 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  such as property and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we apply judgment when estimating the fair value of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss if estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset  if any  are less than the carrying value of the asset 
no impairment charges were recorded in the periods presented 
income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach to record deferred taxes 
our deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities that will result in deductible amounts in future years  including net operating loss carry forwards 
based on estimates  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks include primarily foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks 
interest rate risk we invest our cash equivalents and short term investments primarily in liquid  highly rated us government or municipal fixed income securities  certificates of deposit with financial institutions and money market funds 
unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are held for working capital purposes and acquisition financing 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we do not have material exposure to changes in the fair value of these investments as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our investments 
declines in interest rates may reduce future investment income 
however  a hypothetical decline of in the interest rate on our investments would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
as of june   our credit facility had a borrowing capacity of million with million in term loans outstanding  and no amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility is payable quarterly at specified margins above either the eurodollar margin or the prime rate 
our exposure to interest rate risk under the credit facility will depend on the extent to which we utilize such facility 
to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates under the term loan  on february   we entered into an interest rate swap encompassing the principal balances scheduled to be outstanding as of january  and 
table of contents thereafter  such principal amount will total million on january  and amortize to million on november  the interest rate swap effectively fixes the eurodollar margin at a fixed rate of 
a hypothetical change of from prevailing interest rates as of june  would affect our interest expense and the fair value of the swap by less than million 
in addition to the million of term loans covered by the interest rate swap as of june   the company also had variable rate debt outstanding of million 
a hypothetical increase of in the eurodollar margin or prime rate based interest rate on our variable rate debt outstanding of million as of june  would result in an increase in our interest expense of million per year  assuming constant borrowing levels 
foreign currency exchange risk to date  our international client agreements have been predominately denominated in us dollars  and accordingly  we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to client agreements  and do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
as the local accounts for some of our foreign operations are maintained in the local currency of the respective country  we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement to us dollars 
a hypothetical change of in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements
