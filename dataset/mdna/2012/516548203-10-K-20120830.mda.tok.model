recent accounting pronouncements refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to net revenue  allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  inventory valuation  valuation of deferred income taxes  goodwill valuation  warranty reserves  restructuring costs  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we do not recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
a significant portion of our sales are made to distributors under agreements which contain a limited right to return unsold product and price protection provisions 
therefore  the recognition of net revenue and related cost of revenue from sales to distributors are deferred until the distributor resells the product 
when product revenue is recognized  we establish an estimated allowance for future product returns based on historical returns experience 
actual product returns or pricing adjustments that exceed our estimates could result in additional reductions to revenue 
our products typically carry a one to two year warranty 
in the current fiscal year  we began offering a five year warranty on certain new products 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs that differ from our estimates 
as a result  additional warranty reserves could be required  which could reduce our gross margins 
additionally  we sell extended warranty services  which extend the warranty period for an additional one to three years  depending upon the product 
warranty net revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the warranty service period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  our history of bad debts and the general condition of the industry 
if a major customer s credit worthiness deteriorates  or our customers actual defaults exceed our historical experience  our estimates could change and impact our reported financial results 
inventory valuation our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess and obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future sales demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally three to twelve months 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing 
in addition  specific reserves are recorded to cover risks in the area of end of life products  inventory located at our contract manufacturers  deferred inventory in our sales channel and warranty replacement stock 
if our sales forecast is less than the inventory we have on hand at the end of an accounting period  we may be required to take excess and obsolete inventory charges  which will decrease our gross margin and net operating results for that period 
valuation of deferred income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to zero  primarily due to historical net operating losses and uncertainty of generating future taxable income 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize a deferred tax asset that currently has a valuation allowance  we would be required to reverse the valuation allowance  which would be reflected as an income tax benefit at that time 
goodwill impairment testing during the fiscal year ended june   we early adopted the new provisions issued by the financial accounting standards board that intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing 
the updated guidance permits us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we conduct a two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of our single reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill  and recording an impairment charge if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the analysis  which involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill  the difference of which represents the impairment loss 
the determination of the reporting unit s fair value requires significant judgment and is based on management s best estimate 
we generally use valuation techniques based on our market capitalization and multiples of revenue for similar companies 
in addition  management may consider the reporting unit s expected future earnings  and a control premium  which is the amount that a buyer is willing to pay over the current market price of a company as indicated by the traded price per share ie  market capitalization  in order to acquire a controlling interest 
if our actual financial results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit  we may be exposed to goodwill impairment losses 
during the fiscal year ended june   we made a qualitative assessment of whether goodwill impairment exists 
since we did not determine that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we were not required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
as of june   our book value was million while our market capitalization was million 
share based compensation we record share based compensation in the statements of operations as an expense  based on the estimated grant date fair value of our share based awards  whereby such fair values are amortized to expense over the requisite service period 
our share based awards are currently comprised of common stock options and certain restricted stock awards 
the fair value of our common stock option awards is generally estimated on the grant date using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing formula 
to the extent that certain stock option grants included market conditions  we used a lattice model to estimate the fair value of such grants 
while utilizing the bsm model meets established requirements  the estimated fair values generated by it may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our common stock option awards as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
the fair value of our restricted stock is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested share based awards  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned share based compensation expense 
results of operations fiscal years ended june  and net revenue by product line the following table presents net revenue by product line years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages device enablement   device management   net revenue    for reporting purposes in the table above  we have reclassified net revenues from our non core products  which currently represent less than of net revenue  into the device management product line 
non core products are primarily comprised of legacy products such as print servers  software and other miscellaneous products 
the decrease in net revenue was substantially the result of a decrease in net revenue from our device enablement product line 
we believe that our net revenue was negatively impacted by worldwide general economic conditions  as well as by certain supply constraints that we experienced during the current fiscal year 
in addition  net revenue for the prior fiscal year ended june  included approximately  of deferred revenue that was recognized as a result of entering into contracts that removed certain distributors rights to stock rotation and price protection in connection with an initiative to streamline our sales distribution channel 
there was no similar revenue recognized during the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in net revenue from our device enablement product line was primarily due to a decrease in unit sales of some of our embedded device enablement products  in particular our xport and  to a lesser extent  our micro  which is a legacy embedded serial to ethernet solution  partially offset by an increase in unit sales of our new products  xport pro and premierwave en 
in addition  we had a  royalty sale in the prior fiscal year that did not recur in the current fiscal year 
to a lesser extent  the decrease in net revenue from our device enablement product line was impacted by a decrease in unit sales of our external device enablement products  in particular our micro serial server mss product family  a legacy product  partially offset by an increase in unit sales of our xpress product family 
the decrease in net revenue from our device management product line was due to a decrease in unit sales of our secure lantronix console slc and secure console server scs console server product families  which were offset by sales of our new xprintserver network edition that began shipping in january and an increase in unit sales of our secure lantronix spider sls product family 
net revenue by geographic region the following table presents net revenue by geographic region years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages americas    emea    asia pacific   net revenue    the decrease in net revenue for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  reflects decreased unit sales in the europe  middle east and africa emea  americas  and asia pacific regions 
we believe that our net revenue was negatively impacted by worldwide general economic conditions and  in particular the emea region  which experienced a year over year decline in net revenue 
the decrease in net revenue from the emea region was in large part due to a decrease in unit sales in our embedded device enablement products and  to a lesser extent  our external device enablement products and device management line 
in addition  net revenue for the fiscal year ended june  included approximately  of deferred revenue that was recognized as a result of entering into contracts that removed certain distributors rights to stock rotation and price protection in connection with an initiative to streamline our sales distribution channel 
the decrease in net revenue from the americas and asia pacific regions was primarily due to a decrease in unit sales in our embedded device enablement product line 
gross profit gross profit represents net revenue less cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consisted primarily of the cost of raw material components  subcontract labor assembly from contract manufacturers  manufacturing overhead  establishing or relieving inventory reserves for excess and obsolete products or raw materials  warranty costs  royalties and share based compensation 
the following table presents gross profit years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages gross profit    the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a charge taken for excess and obsolete inventories primarily as a result of a reduction in the sales forecasts for certain products  partially offset by a favorable change in product mix as a result of lower embedded device enablement unit sales 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consisted of personnel related expenses including salaries and commissions  share based compensation  facility expenses  information technology  trade show expenses  advertising and professional legal and accounting fees 
the following table presents selling  general and administrative expenses years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages personnel related expenses   professional fees and outside services   advertising and marketing   facilities   share based compensation  depreciation other   selling  general and administrative   the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to the fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to i a decrease in professional fees and outside services related to the special investigation that was completed during the first quarter of the current fiscal year and the contested proxy that occurred in the prior fiscal year  ii a decrease in personnel related expenses due primarily to separation costs related to the departure of our former ceo and cfo that were recorded in the june and a reduction in headcount directly related to the restructuring activities that occurred in november  which were partially offset by an increase in salaries due to annual merit increases in the current fiscal year  iii a decrease in share based compensation as consideration for performance bonuses  a reduction in head count and a lower average stock price for options  and iv other cost reduction efforts and the completion of our e commerce website resulting in a decrease in advertising and marketing fees 
research and development research and development expenses consisted of personnel related expenses including share based compensation  as well as expenditures to third party vendors for research and development activities 
the following table presents research and development expenses years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages personnel related expenses   facilities professional fees and outside services share based compensation depreciation other research and development   the decrease in research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june   compared to the fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to a decrease in facilities expenses and a decrease in the use of share based compensation as consideration for bonuses and a lower average stock price for options granted during the fiscal year ended june  other expenses decreased as a result of various cost savings measures  including a reduction in travel expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in personnel related expenses as a result of annual merit increases  despite the reduction in salary expense undertaken in november as a result of restructuring activities 
interest expense  net the following table presents interest expense  net years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages interest expense  net the change in interest expense  net  is primarily due to lower interest expenses related to capital leases in the current fiscal year as well as a lower term loan balance 
other expense  net the following table presents other expense  net years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages other expense  net the change in other expense  net  is primarily due to foreign currency remeasurement and transaction adjustments related to our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the us dollar 
in addition  during the fiscal year ended june   we wrote off the remaining carrying value of a former director s non recourse loan from due to the unlikelihood of collection  which resulted in a  charge to other expense 
restructuring charges during the second quarter of the fiscal year ended june   we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and to improve future results of operations 
as part of the restructuring plan  the workforce was reduced by employees 
we recorded a restructuring charge of  which consisted primarily of severance related payments 
the restructuring plan was substantially completed as of december  and substantially all severance related payments were made by june  provision for income taxes the following table presents the income tax provision years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue provision for income taxes the following table presents our effective tax rate based upon our income tax provision years ended june  effective tax rate we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate resulted primarily from the effect of our domestic losses recorded without a tax benefit  as well as the effect of foreign earnings taxed at rates differing from the federal statutory rate 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
as a result of our cumulative losses and uncertainty of generating future taxable income  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets for the fiscal years ended june  and due to the change of ownership provision of the tax reform act of  utilization of our net operating loss nol carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation against taxable income in future periods 
as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax liabilities 
the following table summarizes our nols june  in thousands federal  state  our nol carryovers for federal and state income tax purposes begin to expire in fiscal years and  respectively 
at june   our fiscal through fiscal tax years remain open to examination by federal  state  and foreign taxing authorities 
however  we have nols beginning in fiscal which would cause the statute of limitations to remain open for the year in which the nol was incurred 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of common stock  a term loan and operating activities 
the following table presents details of our working capital and cash and cash equivalents june  increase decrease in thousands working capital    cash and cash equivalents    our sources of cash and liquidity include our existing cash and cash equivalents  amounts under our credit facilities and cash from operations 
we believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital  capital expenditures and other financial commitments for at least the next months 
the primary drivers affecting cash and liquidity are net revenue  working capital requirements  capital expenditures and principal payments on our debt 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june   we completed a private placement of our common stock and received million in net cash proceeds  and also completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock for which we received approximately million in net cash proceeds 
management defines cash and cash equivalents as highly liquid deposits with original maturities of days or less when purchased 
we maintain cash and cash equivalents balances at certain financial institutions in excess of amounts insured by federal agencies 
management does not believe this concentration subjects us to any unusual financial risk beyond the normal risk associated with commercial banking relationships 
we frequently monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and amount of our net revenue  research and development expenses  and expenses associated with any strategic partnerships or acquisitions and infrastructure investments 
we incurred a net loss of million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
we expect our available cash generated from operations  together with existing sources of cash  cash raised from the recent sales of our common stock and  if required  from our credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our long term and short term capital expenditures  working capital and other cash requirements 
we may be required  from time to time  to raise capital through either equity or debt arrangements or a hybrid thereof to i develop or enhance our products  ii take advantage of future opportunities  iii respond to competition or iv continue to operate our business 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to raise capital  including  new equity  debt arrangements or a hybrid thereof or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that any financing activity would not be dilutive to our current stockholders in the future 
to improve our liquidity  during the fiscal year ended june   we reduced net inventories to million as of june   a decrease of million or  compared to million as of june  while we will continue to refine our process to optimize our inventory levels  we expect that our increase in working capital will allow us to put into place stocking levels for new product releases more consistent with anticipated customer demand and increase safety stock levels  which could result in an increase in the balance of net inventories

cash flows the following table presents the major components of the consolidated statements of cash flows years ended june  increase decrease in thousands net cash used in operating activities   net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities  operating activities the decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to cash generated as a result of a reduction in inventory purchases 
this was partially offset by cash utilized for payments related to accounts payable as we paid vendors in a timelier manner  as well as for severance payments related to the restructuring that occurred in november of investing activities the increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily related to the increase in capital expenditures for the purchase of property and equipment related to new products 
financing activities the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to the proceeds from the sale of common shares through the private placement and public offering discussed above
