employees as of december   we had approximately full time and part time employees 
we hire temporary employees and use volunteers to assist during periods of peak attendance at our events 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we believe we enjoy a good relationship with our employees 
insurance we maintain property  casualty  liability  and business interruption insurance  including coverage for acts of terrorism  with insurers we believe to be financially sound 
our insurance policies generally cover accidents that may occur at our speedways  subject to ordinary course deductibles  policy limits and exceptions 
as further described below in risk factors  we use a combination of insurance and self insurance to manage various risks associated with our speedway and other properties  and motorsports events and other business risks 
we believe our insurance levels are sufficient for our needs and consistent with insurance maintained by similar companies

environmental matters solid waste landfilling has occurred on and around cms s property for many years 
landfilling of general categories of municipal solid waste on the cms property ceased in however  there is one landfill at cms currently being permitted to receive inert debris and waste from land clearing activities lcid landfill  and one lcid landfill that was closed in two other lcid landfills on the cms property were closed in cms intends to allow similar lcid landfills to be operated on the cms property in the future 
prior to  cms leased a portion of our property to allied waste industries  inc allied for use as a construction and demolition debris landfill a c d landfill  which received solid waste resulting solely from construction  remodeling  repair or demolition operations on pavement  buildings or other structures  but could not receive inert debris  land clearing debris or yard debris 
the cms c d landfill is now closed 
in addition  allied owns and operates an active solid waste landfill adjacent to cms 
we believe the active solid waste landfill was constructed in such a manner as to minimize the risk of contamination to surrounding property 
management believes that our operations  including the landfills on our property  comply with all applicable federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
management is not aware of any situation related to landfill operations which would have a material adverse effect on our future financial position or results of operations 
portions of the inactive solid waste landfill areas on the cms property are subject to a groundwater monitoring program  and data is submitted to the north carolina department of environment and natural resources denr 
denr has noted that data from certain groundwater sampling events have indicated levels of certain regulated compounds that exceed acceptable trigger levels and organic compounds that exceed regulatory groundwater standards 
denr has not required any remedial action by us at this time with respect to this situation 
if denr was to require us to take certain actions in the future  although none are known at this time  those actions could result in us incurring material costs

risk factors set forth below are all material known risks and uncertainties that  if they were to occur  could materially adversely affect our business or cause our actual results to differ materially from results contemplated by forward looking statements contained in this report or other public statements we may make 
additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impact our business 
shareholders and prospective investors should carefully consider and evaluate all of the risk factors described below 
however  many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or foresee  and undue reliance should not be put on forward looking statements 
risk and other forward looking factors may or may not ultimately be found correct 
these risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended  supplemented  or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in future periodic reports on form q  form k or other forms we file with the sec 
the united states and global economic slowdown  ongoing disruptions in the financial markets and geopolitical events  could have a continued significant adverse impact on consumer and corporate spending and our business 
consumer and corporate spending can significantly impact our operating results  and national or local catastrophes  elevated terrorism alerts or natural disasters could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 
our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending 
the combination of high unemployment  high fuel prices  tight credit markets  difficult residential real estate and mortgage markets  stock market volatility  among other factors  have led to historically low levels of consumer confidence and recessionary conditions 
those economic factors have dampened  and may continue to dampen  consumer and corporate spending  including adversely impacting disposable income and recreational and entertainment spending  resulting in a negative impact on our motorsports and non motorsports activities 
reduced consumer and corporate spending has  and we believe will continue to  negatively impact admissions  sponsorship  advertising and hospitality spending  concession and souvenir sales demand  luxury suite  and other event related revenue  with related speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents effects on our motorsports and non motorsports activities and future revenues  profitability and cash flows 
increasing fuel prices  particularly given the elevated geopolitical tensions in the middle east and other foreign regions  could significantly impact our future results 
while the direction and strength of the united states economy appear to be improving  significant uncertainty remains as to its recovery strength  timing and longevity 
government responses and actions may or may not successfully restore stability to the credit and consumer markets and improve economic conditions in the foreseeable future 
record state and federal budgetary deficits could result in government responses such as higher consumer and corporate income or other tax rates 
governmental spending deficits could also lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates and continued difficult borrowing conditions for consumers and corporate customers 
whether or when these economic conditions might improve cannot be determined at this time 
other factors that can affect consumer and corporate spending include hurricanes  flooding  earthquakes and other natural disasters  elevated terrorism alerts  terrorist attacks  military actions  air travel concerns  and geopolitical events  as well as various industry and other business conditions 
such factors or incidents  even if not directly impacting us  can disrupt or otherwise adversely impact the financial results  spending sentiment and interest of our present or potential customers 
these factors can adversely impact local  regional and national consumer and corporate spending sentiment 
there can be no assurance that government response to the economic slowdown and disruptions in the financial and credit markets will stabilize the economy or financial and credit markets for long periods 
these economic conditions might not improve or could worsen and when these conditions may ultimately improve cannot be determined at this time 
each of these aforementioned negative factors  among others  and particularly when combined  may further adversely impact corporate and individual customer spending and have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and growth 
there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be further adversely impacted by current or unforeseen economic or geopolitical conditions  thereby possibly having a material adverse impact on our future operating results and growth 
as a result of current adverse financial market conditions  investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns 
however  we currently have no direct holdings in these higher risk type instruments and our indirect exposure to these instruments through money market funds or otherwise is believed immaterial 
however  we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our current or future investment portfolios  if any  will remain unimpaired 
bad weather adversely affects the profitability of our motorsports events and postponement or cancellation of major motorsports events could adversely affect us 
we promote outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  driving schools and track rentals  among other things 
although we sell many tickets well in advance of our events  poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations  particularly because we promote a limited number of premier events 
due to inclement weather conditions  we may be required to move a race event to the next raceable day  which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact our walk up admissions  if any  and food  beverage and souvenir sales 
poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods because consumer demand can be affected by the success or experience of past events 
if an event scheduled for one of our facilities is postponed because of weather  national security concerns  natural disasters or other reasons  we could incur increased expenses associated with conducting the rescheduled event  as well as possible decreased revenues from admissions  food  beverage and souvenir sales generated at the rescheduled event 
if such an event is cancelled  we would incur the expenses associated with preparing to conduct the event as well as losing the revenues associated with the event  including live broadcast revenues  to the extent such losses were not covered by insurance 
if a cancelled event is part of the nascar sprint cup or nationwide series  the amount of money we receive from television revenues for all of our nascar sanctioned events in the series that experienced the cancellation could be reduced 
this would occur if  as a result of the cancellation and without regard to whether the cancelled event was scheduled for one of our facilities  nascar experienced a reduction in television revenues in excess of amounts scheduled to be paid to the promoter of the cancelled event

table of contents lack of competitiveness in nascar sprint cup series races or closeness of championship points races  the popularity of race car drivers or changes made by nascar on conducting  promoting and racing as a series sanctioning body  can significantly impact operating results 
a lack of competitiveness in sprint cup series races or the closeness of the championship points race in any particular racing season can significantly impact our operating results 
the number of racing competitors  particularly popular drivers  can affect on track competition and the appeal of racing 
new or changed racing teams could be formed with drivers that generate less fan interest or race less competitively 
these and other factors can affect attendance at nascar sprint cup and nationwide series racing events  as well as corporate marketing interest  which can significantly impact our operating results 
these and other factors  such as the popularity of race car drivers  can affect attendance  media attention and the promotional marketing appeal for sprint cup racing events  as well as other events surrounding the weekends such sprint cup races are promoted 
there can be no assurance that attendance or other event related revenues will not be adversely impacted by a lack of competitive racing or a close championship points race  or a decline in popularity of one or more race car drivers  in any particular season  thereby possibly impacting our operations and growth 
nascar periodically implements new rules or technical and other required changes for race teams and drivers  as well as event promoters  in attempts to increase safety  racing competition and fan and media interest  among other things 
for example  nascar implemented double file restarts  and is planning for car manufacturers chevrolet  toyota  dodge and ford to bring brand identity back to stock car racing with the introduction of re styled sprint cup cars in  in efforts to increase competition on the speedways and generate increased fan interest and new marketing opportunities 
these and other new cars  and other periodically implemented changes  may or may not become more successful or popular with fans 
such factors can affect attendance and other event related revenues for our sprint cup and nationwide series racing events  as well as other events surrounding the weekends such races are promoted 
rule changes can increase operating costs that we may or may not be able to control 
there can be no assurance that attendance or other event related revenues or operating costs will not be adversely impacted by sanctioning body changes in any particular season  thereby possibly impacting our operations and growth 
the success of our business depends  in part  on achieving our objectives for strategic acquisitions and dispositions and efficient and successful integration into our operations 
we pursue acquisitions or joint ventures as part of our long term business strategy 
we purchased nhms in january for million and kys in december for million 
these purchases were funded with available cash and borrowings under the credit facility 
the purchase of nhms and kys and other such transactions may involve significant challenges and risks 
for example  the transactions may not advance our business strategy or we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investments 
we may experience difficulty integrating new employees  business systems and technology  or management s attention may be diverted from our other businesses or operations 
furthermore  the use of cash or additional borrowings could significantly impact our liquidity  impair our ability to borrow additional funds for other business purposes or cause lowered ratings by credit agencies resulting in higher borrowing costs or increased difficulties borrowing additional amounts  among other things 
these factors could adversely affect our future financial condition or operating results 
we may continue to significantly expand and improve our speedway facilities  involving material capital expenditures over several years in amounts or nature that have not yet been determined 
such expenditures may or may not increase our future success and the ability to compete and operate successfully and profitably depends on many factors outside of management s control 
such factors  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could result in possible impairment and other charges that materially adversely affect our future financial condition or results of operations 
management may from time to time evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer be in alignment with our strategic direction 
for example  in we sold the majority of assets and all operations of north carolina speedway  consisting principally of track rentals  because advancement of our business strategy and the foreseeable returns on investment were not satisfactory 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we discontinued our oil and gas operations in we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than optimal 
in addition  there is a risk that we will sell a business whose subsequent performance exceeds expectations 
these factors could adversely affect our future financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents failure to be awarded a nascar event or deterioration in our relationship with nascar could adversely affect our profitability 
our success has been and will remain dependent to a significant extent upon maintaining a good working relationship with the organizations that sanction the races we promote at our facilities  particularly nascar  the sanctioning body for sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series races 
each nascar event is awarded on an annual basis 
although we believe our relationship with nascar is good  nonrenewal of a nascar event license would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future results of operations 
however  we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to obtain nascar licenses to sponsor races at our facilities 
at any time  we may evaluate or attempt to realign one or more nascar sprint cup series or other motorsports series race dates among our multiple track facilities 
we obtained approval to realign an annual nascar sprint cup racing event from ams to kys beginning in many factors and alternatives must be considered  including the popularity and profitability of various races  the relative seating capacity at each track  alternative uses and revenues for such tracks in the event a race is moved  the costs of any capital expenditures to upgrade or expand facilities  the lead time required to complete any such upgrades or expansion  alternative uses of capital  any existing or potential governmental tax incentives  changing economic conditions at the individual tracks and in the economy as a whole  as well as various other strategic issues 
failure to obtain nascar events for any future additional motorsports facility could have a material adverse effect on us 
similarly  nascar is not obligated to modify its race schedules to allow us to schedule our races more efficiently or favorably 
different economic or industry conditions or assumptions  changes in projected cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  or actual race date realignments that differ significantly from those assumed in any impairment evaluation  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluations and future financial condition or results of operations 
relocation of major motorsports events could adversely affect us 
nascar has announced it would consider potential track realignment of sprint cup series racing events to desirable  potentially more profitable market venues of speedway operators 
while relocation of any sprint cup event among our speedways we now own or may own in the future could result in a net increase or decrease in our future operating profitability  long lived assets of a speedway from where a sprint cup racing event may move could become impaired resulting in a material impairment charge that adversely affects our future financial condition or results of operations 
our nascar broadcasting rights revenues are significant and changes could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 
our nascar broadcasting and  to a lesser degree  ancillary media rights fees revenues are significant multi year contracted revenue and cash flow sources for us 
any significant adverse changes to such rights fees revenues could adversely impact our results 
for example  the first few years of the current eight year contract  which began in  had total nascar broadcasting rights fees for the entire industry that were lower than the rights fees 
however  the current broadcasting contract contains a increase over the former contract annual average 
the eight year nascar broadcasting rights agreement expires after  and currently provides us with increases in annual contracted revenues averaging per year 
changes or trends in television broadcast ratings may impact future renewals 
material changes in the media or motorsports industries could result in broadcasting or ancillary media contract renewals different from historical practices 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future liquidity for related discussion on likely decreases in ancillary rights revenue in increased costs associated with  and inability to obtain  adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 
we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our eight speedway facilities  which are generally located near highly populated cities and which hold motorsports events typically attended by large numbers of fans 
these operational  geographical and situational factors  among others  have resulted in  and may continue to result in  significant increases in speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits 
we cannot assure you that future increases in such insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability  thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate if a catastrophic event occurred or major motorsports events were cancelled and liability for personal injuries and product liability claims could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 
while management attempts to obtain  and believes it presently has  reasonable policy limits of property  casualty  liability and business interruption insurance  including coverage for acts of terrorism  with financially sound insurers  we cannot guarantee that our policy limits for property  casualty  liability and business interruption insurance currently in force  including coverage for acts of terrorism  would be adequate should one or multiple catastrophic events occur at or near any of our speedway facilities  or one or more of our major motorsports events were cancelled  or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 
once our present coverage expires  we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available  offered at reasonable costs  or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness 
the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our speedway facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if our asset damage or liability was to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer was unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 
the occurrence of additional national incidents  in particular incidents at sporting events  entertainment or other public venues  may significantly impair our ability to obtain such insurance coverage in the future 
motorsports can be dangerous to participants and to spectators 
we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient  in management s judgment  to protect us from material financial loss due to liability for personal injuries sustained by persons on our premises in the ordinary course of business 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 
the financial stability of certain insurance companies that provide our insurance coverage could be adversely affected by economic  geopolitical and other events or conditions as further discussed above 
in that case  the ability of these insurance companies to pay our potential claims could be impaired  and we might not be able to obtain adequate replacement insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or at all 
any of these events could harm our business  and we cannot provide assurance that future increases in such insurance costs and difficulties in obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our future financial position or operating results 
we may incur significant costs from partial self insurance 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance to manage various risks associated with our speedways and other properties and motorsports events and other business risks 
we may increase the marketing of certain products using self insured promotional warranty programs that could subject us to increased risk of loss should the number and amount of claims significantly increase 
we have increased and may further increase our self insurance limits  which could subject us to increased risk of loss should the number of incidents  damages  casualties or other claims below such self insured limits increase 
management cannot guarantee that the number of uninsured losses will not increase 
an increase in the number of uninsured losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations 
strong competition in the motorsports industry and with other professional and amateur sports could hinder our ability to maintain or improve our position in the industry 
motorsports promotion is a competitive industry 
we compete in regional and national markets  and with isc and other nascar related speedways  to promote events  especially nascar sanctioned sprint cup and nationwide series events  and to a lesser extent  with other speedway owners to promote other nascar  indycar  nhra and woo sanctioned events 
we believe our principal competitors are other motorsports promoters of sprint cup and nationwide series or equivalent events 
certain of our competitors have resources that exceed ours 
nascar is owned by the france family  who also controls isc 
isc presently hosts a significant number of sprint cup and nationwide series races 
our competitors may attempt to build speedways and conduct racing and other motorsports related activities in new markets that may compete with us and our local and regional fan base or marketing opportunities 
speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents we also compete for spectator interest with all forms of professional and amateur spring  summer and fall sports  such as football  baseball  basketball and hockey  conducted in and near atlanta  boston  bristol  charlotte  cincinnati  dallas fort worth  las vegas  lexington  louisville  and san francisco  and regionally and nationally  many of which have resources that exceed ours  and with a wide range of other available entertainment and recreational activities 
these competing events and activities may be held on the same days or weekends as our events 
we cannot assure you that we will maintain or improve our position in light of such competition 
the loss of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations and growth 
our success depends to a great extent upon the availability and performance of our senior management 
their experience within the industry  especially their working relationship with nascar  continues to be of considerable importance to us 
the loss of any of our key personnel due to illness  retirement or otherwise  or our inability to attract and retain key employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business plans 
our credit facility permits significant expenditures for capital projects  investments in and transactions for motorsports and other ancillary businesses  and costs associated with capital improvements could adversely affect our profitability 
we believe significant growth in our revenues depends  in large part  on consistent investment in facilities 
therefore  we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements in our facilities to increase spectator entertainment value and potential revenue growth 
our credit facility  as further described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future liquidity  allows standby letters of credit of up to million  annual capital expenditures of up to million  and provides for additional borrowings of up to million as of december  subject to meeting specified conditions 
we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway 
as further described above in the risk factor the success of our business depends  in part  on achieving our objectives for strategic acquisitions and dispositions and efficient and successful integration into our operations  we plan to continue to make substantial capital expenditures and investments in and future years 
the planned improvements will likely involve material capital expenditures over several years in amounts that have not yet been determined 
the profitability or success of future capital projects and investments is subject to numerous factors  conditions and assumptions  many of which are beyond our control 
significant negative or unfavorable outcomes could reduce our available cash and cash investments or our ability to service current or future indebtedness  require additional borrowings resulting in higher debt service and interest costs  lower our ratings by credit agencies  increase our borrowing costs or difficulties in borrowing additional amounts  cause higher than anticipated depreciation expense  among other negative consequences  and could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
commencement of construction is subject to governmental approval and permitting processes  which could materially affect the ultimate cost and timing of construction 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at our facilities  including undetected soil or land  including environmental  conditions additional land acquisition costs increases in the cost of construction materials and labor unforeseen changes in design litigation  accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site national or regional economic  regulatory or geopolitical changes in addition  actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if those factors or our assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change 
should projects be abandoned or substantially decreased in scope due to the inability to obtain necessary permits or other unforeseen negative factors  we could be required to expense some or all previously capitalized costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
also  should improvement projects not produce a sufficiently high economic yield  including those requiring demolition of a component of a speedway facility  or where capitalization of demolition  construction and historical component costs are limited to the revised estimated value of the project  capitalized expenditures could become impaired resulting in a material impairment charge that adversely affects our future financial condition or results of operations

table of contents future impairment of our property and equipment  other intangible assets and goodwill could adversely affect our profitability 
as of december   we have net property and equipment of  million  net other intangible assets of million and goodwill of million 
also  as further described in the risk factor above the success of our business depends  in part  on achieving our objectives for strategic acquisitions and dispositions and efficient and successful integration into our operations  we plan to continue to make substantial capital investments 
we periodically evaluate long lived assets for possible impairment based on expected future undiscounted operating cash flows and profitability attributable to such assets or when indications of possible impairment occur 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  in we recorded a million non cash impairment charge with no income tax benefit to reduce the carrying value of goodwill related to nhms to estimated fair value  resulting from our latest annual impairment assessment 
also  our latest annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets also considered that our market capitalization was below our consolidated stockholder s equity 
management s analysis of the market capitalization difference  along with additional information on the latest annual impairment assessment  is described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and note to the consolidated financial statements  and is not repeated here 
there have since been no other events or circumstances that might indicate possible impairment 
based on this analysis  management believes the decline in our market capitalization below our consolidated stockholder s equity is temporary  and that no unrecognized impairment of property and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets exists through or as of december  the evaluations are subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
while we believe no unrecognized impairment exists at december   different conditions  trends or assumptions or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and our future financial condition or results of operations 
the profitability or success of future capital projects and investments are subject to numerous factors  conditions and assumptions  many of which are beyond our control  and if significantly negative or unfavorable  could become impaired and materially adversely affect our future financial condition or results of operations 
see the risk factor relocation of major motorsports events could adversely affect us above for related discussion on impairment considerations 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position  ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments  and ability to pay dividends 
we have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations 
as of december   we had total outstanding long term debt of approximately million  or million excluding issuance discount of million  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our substantial indebtedness and leverage could make it more difficult and costly to borrow money and may reduce funds available for financing our operations and other business activities and have other important consequences  including the following requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payment of principal  debt redemption premium  if any  and interest on our debt  which would reduce funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  dividends  stock repurchases  and other corporate purposes  our ability to adjust to adverse or changing market conditions and withstand competitive pressures could be limited  and we may be vulnerable to additional risk if there is a downturn in general economic conditions or our business  we may be at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less leverage and greater operating and financial flexibility than we do  our debt levels may increase our interest costs or increase the risks that we may not be able to obtain additional financing or obtain financing at acceptable rates  our debt levels may increase our difficulties in refinancing or replacing our outstanding obligations such as the scheduled maturities of our credit facility in  senior notes in  and senior notes in  and our debt levels may cause lowered ratings by credit agencies  resulting in higher borrowing costs or increased difficulties borrowing additional amounts 
each or all of the factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial health and profitability 
speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
a significant portion of our cash flow must be used to service our indebtedness and is therefore not available for use in our business 
in  we paid million in interest on our indebtedness 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  legislative  regulatory  industry  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
our operations are substantially impacted by the success of nascar in the promotion and conduct of racing as a sanctioning body  our relationship with nascar and the popularity of nascar and other motorsports generally  and the impact of competition  including competition from other speedway owners like isc 
although under our control  our cash outlays for dividends are funded in part with cash that would otherwise be available for our capital spending  repurchases of common stock or other liquidity needs  and dividend increases further limit cash otherwise available for such uses or needs 
our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we may redeem some or all of our senior notes or senior notes at any time at annually declining redemption premiums beginning june  and february   respectively 
such redemptions could limit funds otherwise available for future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes 
however  we may not be able to complete such refinancing or redemption on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our future borrowing costs on current outstanding or future indebtedness could substantially increase and adversely affect our financial health and profitability  each of which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the purchases of nhms and kys significantly increased our outstanding indebtedness and leverage  and our current or future capital spending plans could further significantly increase our future outstanding debt  resulting in an adverse effect on our financial health and profitability 
as of december   we had total outstanding long term debt of approximately million and our credit facility permits additional borrowings of up to million 
the ongoing disruptions and tight financial and capital markets could have a significant adverse impact on our future interest and other borrowing costs 
our operating results have benefited from relatively low interest rates on our floating rate credit facility and future increases  if significant  could have a significant adverse impact on our future results 
also  our future interest and borrowing costs under our credit facility  any refinanced or replaced current outstanding indebtedness  or new additional financing could substantially increase and adversely affect our financial health and profitability 
interest and other borrowing costs have significantly increased for many companies in numerous industries  and may increase from current levels in the foreseeable future 
while at times we use interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate risk  we are currently unable to predict if or when the interest rates could change 
our significant indebtedness levels and leverage  along with difficult credit market conditions  could result in higher interest and other borrowing costs and more restrictive financial and other loan covenants under any new credit facility or other borrowing arrangements 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  interest rates under our credit facility are based on specified tier levels that are adjustable periodically based upon certain consolidated total leverage ratios 
our current planned or unplanned future capital spending and possible increases in our future outstanding indebtedness  along with our current leverage  could further reduce the amounts by which we exceed minimum required covenant compliance levels and result in changes to our interest cost tier levels under our credit facility 
future changes in such surplus in our compliance levels or interest cost tiers could result in increased interest costs on current or future indebtedness  restricted or reduced borrowings and availability under our credit facility  and increased costs of borrowing for any new financing 
each or all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial health and profitability 
restrictions imposed by terms of our indebtedness could limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to secure additional financing

our credit facility is the primary source of committed funding from which we finance our planned capital expenditures  strategic initiatives  such as repurchases of our common stock  and working capital needs 
our credit facility contains more extensive and restrictive covenants than the indentures for the senior notes and the senior notes 
in addition to covenants described above  our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  as well as limits our acquisitions  capital expenditures and investments  as further described in future liquidity 
the company regularly monitors compliance with the various covenants under each of these debt agreements 
failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
future default on any of these covenants could result in default under  or an inability to undertake certain activities in compliance with  the underlying debt agreements 
non compliance with financial covenant ratios or other covenants could prevent us from being able to access further borrowings under  or require repayment of  our credit facility 
our ability to meet those covenants  financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control  and there can be no assurance that we will meet those tests 
our credit facility  the senior notes  and the senior notes contain cross default provisions 
a default under any of these debt agreements could likely trigger cross default provisions allowing the lenders  in each case  to exercise their rights and remedies as defined under their respective agreements 
if there were an event of default under any loan agreement  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding  including accrued interest or other obligations  to be immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to repay these amounts  such lenders could proceed against the collateral  if any  granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
if any indebtedness were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that we could repay or refinance the accelerated amounts due 
as a result of these covenants  our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to secure additional financing  if needed  may be significantly restricted 
we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us 
should we pursue further development and or acquisition opportunities  the timing  size and success as well as associated potential capital commitments of which are unknown at this time  we may need to raise additional capital through debt and or equity financings 
there can be no assurance that adequate debt and equity financing will be available  if and when needed  on satisfactory terms or will be permitted under our various debt arrangements 
failure to obtain further financing could have a negative effect on our business and operations 
we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under our various debt agreements as of december  at this time  management also believes we will remain in compliance with all applicable covenants for at least the next months 
however  although not anticipated at this time  significant negative adverse factors such as material tangible  intangible or other asset impairment charges or unforeseen declines in our future profitability or cash flows from ongoing recessionary conditions or other market factors  if large enough individually or in combination  could result in our inability to remain in compliance 
these and other possible negative factors that could impact compliance are further described throughout this risk factors section 
we may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
despite our level of indebtedness  we may be permitted to incur additional debt in the future 
in addition  we may be able to secure this additional debt with company  subsidiary or new business assets 
at december   we had approximately million of additional revolving loans available for borrowing under our credit facility 
furthermore  any additional financing arrangements we enter into may contain additional restrictive and financial covenants 
these covenants may restrict or prohibit many actions including  but not limited to  our ability to incur debt  create liens  prepay debt  pay dividends  limit capital expenditures or investments  engage in transactions with stockholders and affiliates  issue capital stock  sell certain assets  or speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k

failure to maintain compliance with any new covenants could constitute a default  which could accelerate the payment of any amounts outstanding under any new or existing financial agreements 
government regulation of certain motorsports sponsors could negatively impact the availability of promotion  sponsorship and advertising revenue for us 
the motorsports industry generates significant revenue each year from the promotion  sponsorship and advertising of various companies and their products  some of which are subject to government regulation 
advertising of the alcoholic beverage and tobacco industry is generally subject to greater governmental regulation than advertising by other sponsors of our events 
certain of our sponsorship contracts are terminable upon the implementation of adverse regulations 
the alcoholic beverage and tobacco industry has provided substantial financial support to the motorsports industry through  among other things  the purchase of advertising time  the sponsorship of racing teams and the past sponsorship of racing series such as the winston cup now sprint cup series and the busch now nationwide series  and generally are subject to greater governmental regulation than are other sponsors of our events 
we are unaware of any proposed additional governmental regulation that would materially limit the availability to motorsports of promotion  sponsorship or advertising revenue from the alcoholic beverage or tobacco industry 
we cannot assure you that the alcoholic beverage or tobacco industry will continue to sponsor motorsports events  suitable alternative sponsors could be located or nascar will continue to sanction individual racing events sponsored by the alcoholic beverage industry at any of our facilities 
implementation of further restrictions on the advertising or promotion of alcoholic beverage products could adversely affect us 
failure to maintain adequate security for certain customer related information could damage our reputation with current or prospective customers  subject us to litigation or adverse regulatory actions or cause us to incur substantial additional costs 
in the ordinary course of business  we collect and store certain financial and other information from individuals  corporations and others  including customers  employees and outside contractors 
we process customer payment card information  perform credit  employment and other business related inquiries  and collect customary information used for marketing purposes 
we contract with third parties for processing orders and payments of a large portion of our tickets and other access sold for our events  much of which is transacted indirectly through links with our internal websites 
our online operations depend upon secure transmission of confidential information over public networks  including information permitting and transacting cashless payments 
we commit significant internal and external resources to network security  data encryption  and other security measures to protect our networks and data  but there can be no assurance these security measures provide complete security 
our or third party networks could be breached and we could be unable to protect sensitive data 
a breach of our security networks that results in personal  corporate or other sensitive information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with current or prospective customers and others 
such security breach could result in litigation against us  adverse regulatory actions or imposing substantial penalties or fines 
also  a security breach could require or result in us spending significant additional resources on our information security systems and could disrupt our operations  particularly sales and marketing 
any significant breach could have a material adverse impact on our future financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our chairman owns a majority of our common stock and will control any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
as of march   mr

table of contents changes in income tax laws could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
at december   net deferred tax liabilities totaled million  after reduction for net deferred tax assets of million 
at december   valuation allowances of million have been provided against deferred tax assets because management has determined that ultimate realization is not more likely than not 
these net deferred tax liabilities will likely reverse in future years and could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
changes in tax laws  assumptions  estimates or methods used in the accounting for income taxes  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on amounts or timing of realization or settlement 
such effects could result in a material acceleration of income taxes currently payable or valuation charges for realization uncertainties  which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
environmental costs may negatively impact our financial condition 
solid waste landfilling has occurred on and around the property at cms for many years 
if damage to persons or property or contamination of the environment is determined to have been caused by the conduct of our business or by pollutants used  generated or disposed of by us  or which may be found on our property  we may be held liable for such damage and may be required to pay the cost of investigation or remediation  or both  of such contamination or damage 
the amount of such liability  as to which we are self insured  could be material 
state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment also can include noise abatement laws that may be applicable to our racing events 
changes in federal  state or local laws  regulations or requirements  or the discovery of previously unknown conditions  could require additional significant expenditures by us for remediation and compliance 
land use laws may negatively impact our growth 
our development of new motorsports facilities and  to a lesser extent  the expansion of existing facilities requires compliance with applicable federal  state and local land use planning  zoning and environmental regulations 
regulations governing the use and development of real estate may prevent us from acquiring or developing prime locations for motorsports facilities  substantially delay or complicate the process of improving existing facilities or increase the costs of any such activities

although we sell a substantial number of tickets well in advance of our larger events  poor weather conditions can have a negative effect on our results of operations 
poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods because consumer demand can be affected by the success or experience of past events 
management believes our financial performance has not been materially affected by inflation 
results of operations our revenues and expenses are classified in the following categories because they are important to  and used by  management in assessing operations admissions  event related revenue  nascar broadcasting revenue  and other operating revenue 
admissions includes ticket sales for all of our events 
event related revenue includes amounts received from sponsorship and naming rights fees  luxury suite rentals  event souvenir merchandise sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  advertising and other promotional revenues  hospitality revenues  track rentals  driving school and karting revenues  camping and other non admission access revenues  broadcasting rights other than nascar broadcasting revenue  and other event and speedway related revenues 
nascar broadcasting revenue includes rights fees obtained for domestic television broadcasts of nascar sanctioned events held at the company s speedways 
other operating revenue includes certain merchandising revenues of smi properties and tsi  car and part sales of us legend cars  restaurant  catering and membership income from the speedway clubs at cms and tms  revenues of oil chem  which produces an environmentally friendly micro lubricant  tms oil and gas mineral rights lease revenues  and industrial park and office rentals 
earnings or losses on equity investees includes our share of ma merchandising joint venture equity investee profits or losses 
our revenue items produce different operating margins 
broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  and luxury suite and track rentals produce higher margins than non event merchandise sales  as well as sales of us legend cars  oil chem  smi properties  tsi or other operating revenues 
we classify our expenses to include direct expense of events  nascar purse and sanction fees  and other direct operating expense  among other categories 
direct expense of events principally includes cost of souvenir sales  non nascar race purses and sanctioning fees  property and event insurance  compensation of certain employees  advertising  sales and admission taxes  cost of driving school and karting revenues  event settlement payments to non nascar sanctioning bodies and outside event support services 
nascar purse and sanction fees includes payments to  and portions of broadcasting revenues retained by  nascar for associated events held at our speedways 
other direct operating expense includes the cost of certain smi properties and tsi merchandising  us legend cars  speedway clubs  oil chem and industrial park and office tower rental revenues

table of contents near term operating factors there are many factors that affect our growth potential  future operations and financial results  including the following operating factors that are discussed below or elsewhere in this report as indicated 
items discussed in this section general factors and current operating trends  including ongoing uncertainty due to weak economic conditions  high fuel and food prices  high unemployment and tight credit and financial markets also discussed in item a risk factors our long term  multi year contracted revenues are significant earnings guidance items discussed elsewhere in indicated sections of this report industry overview  including ongoing improvements in our sport discussed in item business industry overview reduced interest costs from issuance of senior notes due  credit facility amendment and restatement  and early redemption of senior subordinated notes discussed in item a risk factors  below in future liquidity and note to the consolidated financial statements eight year nascar broadcasting rights agreement discussed in item industry overview and below in future liquidity quarterly cash dividends on common stock discussed below in liquidity and capital resources dividends general factors and current operating trends management believes many of our revenue categories were  and may continue to be  negatively impacted by declines in consumer and corporate spending from the recession  high fuel and food prices  high unemployment  difficult credit and housing markets  low levels of consumer confidence  sizable stock market volatility and other economic factors  including adversely impacting recreational and entertainment spending 
the strength and duration of recovery in the us economy currently remains uncertain 
higher fuel prices  particularly given the elevated geopolitical tensions in the middle east and other foreign regions  could significantly impact consumer spending  economic recovery and our future results 
government responses and actions may or may not successfully restore long term stability to the credit and consumer markets and improved economic conditions 
record state and federal budgetary deficits could result in government responses such as higher consumer and corporate income or other tax rates 
governmental spending deficits could lead to higher interest rates and continued difficult borrowing conditions for consumers and corporate customers 
whether or when these severe conditions might further improve cannot be determined at this time 
each of these negative factors  and particularly when combined  have and may further adversely impact various industries of our present and potential consumer and corporate customers  resulting in continued or further spending declines that could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
see item a risk factors for additional information on the ongoing recessionary conditions  financial market disruptions and geopolitical risks 
for our events  similar to  management has further reduced many ticket prices  and continues to offer extended payment terms to many ticket buyers although generally not beyond when events are held to help foster fan support and mitigate any near term demand weakness 
many of our fans are purchasing tickets closer to event dates and we have initiated various promotional campaigns to incentivize earlier ticket purchasing and season ticket package renewal 
we continually search for new and innovative promotional campaigns to foster attendance by families  particularly those with younger children and teenagers 
also  we are increasingly investing in social media advertising and web based applications to attract  and provide contemporary interactive digital and enhanced entertainment experiences for  our younger demographic markets 
almost four million fans attended our events in  demonstrating that demand and appeal for motorsports entertainment in our markets has remained strong even in challenging circumstances 
as described below  much of our future revenues are already contracted under television broadcasting rights and other long term contracts 
admission revenues for reflect lower average ticket prices and  to a lesser extent  fewer fans attending our race events 
lower ticket prices in constitute approximately of the total decline in admissions revenues for nascar sanctioned racing events as compared to we have increased promotional activities to help offset the ongoing impact of these adverse economic and market conditions 
smi s seasonal and event based business model results in relatively long revenue cycles because many tickets and event related revenues are sold well in advance 
as such  it may take relatively longer for smi s results to again reflect sales growth as economic conditions improve 
while lower ticket prices and extended payment terms can affect operating margins and lengthen cash flow cycles as compared to historical levels  management believes these are prudent measures in the current operating environment 
speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents as described below  much of our future revenues are already contracted under television broadcasting rights and other long term contracts 
for  all of our nascar sprint cup and most of our nationwide series event sponsorships are already sold  and many for years beyond the television ratings  particularly for the nascar sprint cup series  as well as the nascar nationwide and camping world truck series  have shown increases over last year 
in  the sprint cup series continued as the second highest rated regular season televised sport behind only the national football league  and was the first or second highest televised sport out of point event weekends 
also  the nascar nationwide series was the second  and the nascar camping world truck series was the third  highest rated motorsports series on television in in  similar to past and future years  nascar continues to make refinements to racing rules  championship points formats  technical changes and other adjustments as a sanctioning body to enhance on track racing competition and excitement and generate additional fan interest 
see item business industry overview and future liquidity below for additional information on changes and improvements in our sport  increased television ratings and expanding viewership  and widening demographics 
as further described in item a risk factors  a lack of competitiveness in sprint cup series races  the closeness of the championship points race  race car driver popularity  and the success of nascar racing in general  in any particular racing season  can also significantly impact our operating results 
these and similar factors can affect attendance at nascar sprint cup and nationwide racing events  as well as corporate marketing interest  that can significantly impact our operating results 
all of the aforementioned factors  among others  can have a material adverse impact on our future operating results  cash flows and growth 
however  management believes our strong operating cash flow will continue  and that ticket demand and corporate marketing and promotional spending will increase as the economy improves 
our long term  multi year contracted revenues are significant much of our total revenue is generated under long term contracts 
for example  the term of the eight year nascar television broadcast agreement is through  and many of our sponsorships and other corporate marketing contracts are for multiple years 
also  we have contracted revenues under several long term operating leases for various office  warehouse and industrial park space to various entities largely involved in motorsports 
management believes the substantial amount of total revenue generated under such long term contracts helps stabilize our financial resilience and profitability  particularly during difficult economic conditions 
management believes the attractive demographics surrounding motorsports and our premier markets  where we own first class facilities continue to provide substantial opportunities for increasing our number of longer term sponsorship partners and commitments 
our naming rights agreement that renamed sears point raceway as infineon raceway expires in early the expiring agreement has provided significant contracted revenues over its ten year term 
however  the annual contracted revenue we receive under this agreement is not material 
there can be no assurance we will execute any replacement agreements on acceptable terms 
future costs incurred for renaming the speedway facility  and replacing promotional signage  materials and merchandise  are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
also  we expect lower revenue from our ancillary rights agreements in as further discussed below in future liquidity eight year nascar broadcasting and multi year ancillary rights agreements 
earnings guidance in connection with our fourth quarter and full year earnings release  management provided full year guidance of per diluted share from continuing operations 
the wide range of earnings guidance reflects the continuing negative impact of uncertain economic conditions  as well as the timing and pace of economic recovery 
the guidance also reflects expiration of infineon raceway s naming rights agreement and reduced nascar ancillary rights revenues 
high or increasing fuel and food prices  particularly given the geopolitical tensions in the middle east and other foreign regions  could significantly impact our future results 
year over year comparisons of operating results in addition to the comparative information below  certain non gaap financial information is set forth in item selected financial data which management believes  among other things  helps in understanding and comparing our results of operations 
also  due to the economic and other factors described above in near term operating factors  management believes admissions  many event related revenue categories  and other operating revenues reflected below continue to be negatively impacted by low consumer and corporate spending due to the weak economic conditions  high fuel and food prices  high unemployment  and difficult consumer credit and housing markets 
poor weather can negatively affect current events  particularly attendance  as well as successive events in future periods because past fan and other customer event experience can impact future demand

admissions for decreased by million  or  from such revenue for this decrease is due to lower average ticket prices and  to a lesser extent  lower overall admissions at nascar sanctioned and other racing events held in lower ticket prices in constitute approximately of the total decline in admissions revenues for nascar sanctioned racing events as compared to the overall decrease was partially offset by the race date realignments  particularly kys s nascar and  to a much lesser extent  nhms s indycar race events 
along with the ongoing weak economic conditions further described above  management believes admissions were also negatively impacted by poor weather surrounding nascar racing events held at ams in the third quarter  including rescheduling of its nascar sprint cup race from sunday to tuesday 
event related revenue for increased by million  or  over such revenue for this increase reflects the race date realignments  particularly kys s nascar  and lvms s and nhms s indycar  events 
the increase also reflects higher track rentals  driving school  souvenir merchandising  radio broadcasting  food and beverage concessions and other event related revenues in the overall increase was partially offset by declines of approximately for event related revenues associated with nascar sanctioned racing events held in as compared to nascar broadcasting revenue for increased by million  or  over such revenue for this increase is due to higher annual contractual broadcast rights fees for nascar sanctioned racing events held in as compared to other operating revenue for decreased by million  or  from such revenue for this decrease is due primarily to lower non event souvenir merchandising and  to a lesser extent  oil chem revenues  which were partially offset by higher us legend cars revenues in as compared to direct expense of events for increased by million  or  over such expense for this increase is due primarily to the race date realignments  particularly kys s nascar  and lvms s and nhms s indycar  events 
the increase also reflects higher operating costs associated with increased souvenir merchandising revenues and  to a lesser extent  higher operating costs associated with ams s rescheduled nascar sprint cup racing event due to poor weather 
admissions and event related revenues directly impact many event expenses such as sales and admission taxes  credit card processing fees  sales commissions and costs of merchandise sales 
the overall increase was partially offset by cost reduction efforts for outside event support services and other event expenses

seasonality and quarterly results our business has been  and is expected to remain  somewhat seasonal 
we recognize revenues and operating expenses for all events in the calendar quarter in which conducted 
concentration of racing events in any particular future quarter  and the growth in our operations  including speedway acquisitions  with attendant increases in overhead expenses  may tend to minimize operating income in respective future quarters

racing schedules may change from time to time  which can lessen the comparability of operating results between quarters of successive years and increase or decrease the seasonal nature of our motorsports business

if future operating results or events result in ratios below the required minimum  management is prepared to take certain actions to remain compliant 
such actions could include  for example  loan repayments or refinancing  reducing capital expenditures or operating expenses where practical  or obtaining loan compliance waivers 
however  we can provide no assurance that further deteriorations in our profitability or cash flows  or other unforeseen negative operating factors or conditions  would not result in non compliance with this or any other debt covenant 
any such non compliance could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition  operating results or cash flows  and our ability to maintain compliance can be affected by events beyond our control 
as further described in item a risk factors  possible material adverse effects from non compliance could include  among others  cross default under any or all of our debt agreements and acceleration of all amounts outstanding 
general economic conditions as further discussed above in general factors and current operating trends  various economic  industry and geopolitical factors have dampened  and could continue to dampen  consumer and corporate spending 
we believe this reduced spending will continue to negatively impact admissions and event related revenues  with related effects on our motorsports and non motorsports activities and future revenues  profitability and cash flows 
our operating results have benefited from relatively lower interest rates under our credit facility 
future economic and financial market conditions could result in continuing increases in interest rates and other borrowing costs 
at present outstanding debt levels  with increased exposure to variable interest rate fluctuations  higher interest rates would negatively impact our future profitability and cash flows 
these factors  as well as others  could make compliance with restrictive financial covenants more difficult

eight year nascar broadcasting and multi year ancillary rights agreements broadcasting revenues continue to be a significant long term revenue source for our core business 
also  nascar ratings can impact attendance at our events and sponsorship opportunities 
a substantial portion of our profits in recent years has resulted from television revenues received from nascar contracts with various television networks 
as further described in part i  item business of our annual report  we participate in the combined eight year nascar agreements with fox  abc espn  tnt and speed channel for the domestic television broadcast rights to all nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series events for through this eight year nascar broadcasting rights arrangement provides us with increases in annual contracted revenues through averaging per year 
our contracted nascar broadcasting revenues totaled approximately million for  and are expected to approximate million for the television ratings  particularly for the nascar sprint cup series  as well as the nascar nationwide and camping world truck series  have shown increases over last year 
in  the sprint cup series continued as the second highest rated regular season televised sport behind only the national football league  and was the first or second highest televised sport out of point event weekends 
also  the nascar nationwide series was the second  and the nascar camping world truck series speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents was the third  highest rated motorsports series on television in in  over million unique viewers watched a nascar sprint cup series event  and with the highest percentage of female viewers of any major sport 
see item business industry overview for additional information on ratings  expanding viewership and widening demographics 
we believe these increasingly strong ratings  desirable demographic audiences  along with other favorable viewership characteristics  bode well for nascar s upcoming broadcast media rights renegotiations 
management believes this long term contracted revenue helps stabilize our financial strength  earnings and cash flows 
future changes in race schedules would impact broadcasting revenues 
similar to many televised sports  overall seasonal averages for motorsports may increase or decrease from year to year  and television ratings for certain individual events may fluctuate from year to year for any number of reasons 
while this long term rights agreement will likely result in annual revenue increases over the contract period  associated annual increases in purse and sanction fees paid to nascar may continue 
the current eight year television broadcasting agreement with various television networks was negotiated and contracted by nascar  and we are not a party to the agreement 
our share of these television broadcast revenues are contracted  and purse and sanction fees are negotiated  with nascar on an annual basis for each nascar sanctioned racing event scheduled to be held by us in the upcoming season year 
under these annual agreements  we are obligated to conduct events in the manner stipulated under the terms and conditions of the respective sanctioning agreements 
in  an ancillary rights package for nascar 
com  nascar radio  international and other broadcasting  nascar images  sportsvision  fanscan  specialty pay per view telecasts  and other media content distribution was reached among us  nascar and others in the motorsports industry 
nascar announced this industry wide total ancillary rights package was for twelve years 
the following is based largely on recent information provided to us by nascar 
since inception of this rights package  we have received annual shared net revenue of various nascar partners such as turner sports nascar 
com  siriusxm radio and other media content distributors under nascar negotiated contracts 
siriusxm radio has been the largest contributor to the industry s ancillary rights revenue 
in  sirius satellite radio  the predecessor to siriusxm radio  entered into a five year agreement as nascar s exclusive satellite radio partner 
sirius satellite radio and xm satellite radio have since merged to form sirius xm radio 
with one fewer satellite media content distributor actively competing for associated distribution rights  nascar informed us that recently renegotiated distribution rights agreements with siriusxm radio are lower than under previous contracts 
as a result  along with other nascar efforts to better maximize the industry s ancillary rights  nascar informed us that sharable net revenues in will likely be insignificant 
we believe these rights continue to have significant and increasing long term value  which is not adequately reflected by such shared revenue 
however  we do not presently control the annual profitability shared with industry wide participants  and there can be no assurance that such annual revenue amounts will or will not continue in any one year 
we received significant revenues over the term of this ancillary rights agreement  however  annual amounts have not been material 
stock repurchase program our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing smi to repurchase up to an aggregate of million shares of our outstanding common stock from time to time  depending on market conditions  share price  applicable limitations under our various debt agreements  and other factors the board of directors or their designees  in their sole discretion  may consider relevant 
the purchases can be in the open market or private transactions 
the stock repurchase program is presently funded using available cash and cash equivalents 
during  we repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately million 
as of december   we could repurchase up to an additional  shares under the current authorization 
capital expenditures management believes significant growth in our revenues depends  in part  on consistent investment in facilities 
as such  we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements in our facilities 
currently  a number of significant capital projects are underway 
projects at december   we had various construction projects underway 
similar to prior years  we plan to continue modernizing and expanding concessions  luxury suites  camping and hospitality areas  restrooms and other fan amenities at our speedway facilities 
we plan to invest in social media and web application technology to attract and enhance the entertainment experience of race fans 
we also plan to continue improving and expanding on site roads and available parking  and reconfiguring traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow at our speedways 
speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents at this time  aggregate payments for capital expenditures in are estimated to approximate to million 
management plans to fund these capital expenditures with available cash and cash investments  working capital or borrowings under our credit facility as needed 
our expansion and improvement plans involve material capital expenditures in and over several years in amounts not yet finalized 
the profitability or success of these and other future capital projects are subject to numerous factors  conditions and assumptions  some of which are beyond our control  and if significantly negative or unfavorable  could result in asset impairments 
future capital spending in excess of current plans could significantly increase our future depreciation expense and outstanding indebtedness and leverage 
each of these factors  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could materially adversely affect our future financial condition or results of operations 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at our facilities  including undetected soil or land  including environmental  conditions additional land acquisition costs increases in the cost of construction materials and labor unforeseen changes in design litigation  accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site national or regional economic changes in addition  the actual cost could vary materially from estimates if assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change 
construction is also subject to state and local permitting processes which  if changed  could materially adversely affect the ultimate cost and timing of construction 
should projects be abandoned or substantially decreased in scope due to the inability to obtain necessary permits or other unforeseen negative factors  we could be required to expense some or all previously capitalized costs which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
we continually evaluate new opportunities that will add value for our stockholders  including the acquisition and construction of new speedway facilities  the expansion and development of existing us legend cars and oil chem products and markets  and the expansion into new and complementary businesses 
dividends any decision concerning the payment of quarterly or annual common stock dividends depends upon our results of operations  financial condition and capital expenditure plans  applicable limitations under our various debt agreements  and other factors the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
as further described above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  our credit facility allows aggregate payments of dividends and repurchases of smi securities of up to million each year  increasable up to million  subject to maintaining certain financial covenants 
the senior notes indenture and the senior notes indenture permit dividend payments each year of up to per share of common stock  increasable subject to meeting certain financial covenants 
on february   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock aggregating approximately million payable on march  to shareholders of record as of march  this quarterly cash dividend is being paid using available cash and cash investments subject to the limitations and considerations described in the preceding paragraph 
this dividend represents a increase over the prior year quarterly dividend  and is being funded in part with cash that would otherwise be available for repurchases of common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements as further described in liquidity and capital resources above  our credit facility provides for a separate sub limit for letters of credit of up to million 
as of december   we had aggregate outstanding letters of credit of  also  as of december   we had a contingent guarantee obligation associated with an equity investee limited to approximately million  which expires in should the equity investee have insufficient future financial resources and such obligation remains due  we could be required to fund part or all of the guarantee up to the obligation amount determined at that time 
although reasonably possible that some obligation could arise in the future  the amount  if any  is not reasonably estimable at this time 
as such  management believes no obligation should be recorded at this time

critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses  including amounts that are susceptible to change 
we continually review our accounting policies and accounting estimates  and the application and effect on our financial statements and disclosures  for conformity with gaap  including relevance  accuracy  completeness and non omission of material information 
our critical accounting policies include accounting methods and estimates underlying such financial statement preparation  as well as judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies 
in applying critical accounting policies and making estimates  materially different amounts or results could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with risk factors  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and the consolidated financial statements  including the associated notes  appearing elsewhere in this report 
as indicated below  certain accounting policies that are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are not repeated in this section 
we believe the critical accounting policies  including amounts involving significant estimates  uncertainties and susceptibility to change  include the following the following critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements where indicated below revenue and expense recognition for racing events note accounting for nascar broadcasting revenue and purse and sanction fees note revenue recognition for marketing agreements note revenue recognition for non racing event deferred income note accounting for discontinued oil and gas operations note revenue recognition for non event souvenir merchandise and other revenues note joint venture equity investment  including recoverability and impairment note loss contingencies and financial guarantees  including equity investee contingent obligations note accounting for share based compensation note fair value of financial instruments note accounting for uncertainties in income taxes notes and recoverability of property and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets as of december   we had net property and equipment of  million  net other intangible assets of million  and goodwill of million 
as described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we follow applicable authoritative guidance which specifies  among other things  nonamortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires testing for possible impairment at least annually 
when events or circumstances indicate possible impairment may have occurred  we evaluate long lived assets  including tangible assets and intangible assets subject to amortization  for possible impairment based on expected future undiscounted operating cash flows attributable to such assets using applicable authoritative guidance 
when improvement projects produce a higher economic yield and require demolition of a component of a speedway facility  capitalization of demolition  construction and historical component costs are limited to the revised estimated value of the project 
nascar has announced it would consider potential track realignment of sprint cup series racing events to desirable  potentially more profitable market venues of speedway operators 
our annual impairment assessment did not consider the possibility that management may realign one or more other nascar sprint cup series racing events among its speedway facilities  which could result in net higher or improved future projected cash flows 
while relocation of any sprint cup event among our speedways we now or may own in the future could result in a net increase in our future operating profitability  long lived assets of a speedway from where a sprint cup racing event may move could become impaired resulting in a material impairment charge that adversely speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents affects our future financial condition or results of operations 
various business and other factors associated with recoverability and impairment considerations are also described in item a risk factors above 
as of december   our market capitalization was below our consolidated shareholder s equity 
despite ongoing domestic and global economic challenges  management believes there has been no fundamental change in our core motorsports business 
management analyzed the difference for possible impairment as further described in note to the financial statements goodwill and other intangible assets 
based on this analysis  management believes the decline in our market capitalization below our consolidated shareholder s equity is temporary and not an indicator of impairment  and that goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired as of december  the methods  factors and assumptions used in our annual impairment assessment are further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  and are not repeated here except as pertaining to the impairment charge described below 
our latest annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the second quarter indicated the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and each indefinite lived intangible asset exceeded its associated carrying value except for one reporting unit  nhms 
the impairment evaluation was based predominately on management s best estimate of future discounted operating cash flows and profitability for all reporting units 
the evaluation indicated the carrying values for nhms exceeded estimated fair value 
as such  a non cash impairment charge of  with no income tax benefit was reflected in to reduce goodwill related to nhms to estimated fair value 
we previously reported that last year s annual evaluation found the estimated fair value for this reporting unit exceeded carrying values by a relatively nominal amount 
this year s annual evaluation reflected lowered estimated future cash flows principally because of the severity and length of the recession extending beyond our previous forecast  reducing visibility on profitability recovery 
see note to the consolidated financial statements impairment charges on goodwill and other intangible assets for information on historical accounting for nhms s goodwill 
the impairment did not pertain to or affect the underlying value of our race date intangibles 
the profitability or success of our future capital projects are subject to numerous factors  conditions and assumptions  some of which are beyond our control  and if significantly negative or unfavorable  could become impaired and materially adversely affect our future financial condition or results of operations 
management believes there has since been no other events or circumstances which indicate possible impairment  and that no unrecognized impairment of property and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets exists through or as of december  the evaluations are subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
different economic or industry conditions or assumptions  changes in projected cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the impairment evaluation and our future financial condition or results of operations 
depreciable and amortizable lives for property and equipment and intangible assets depreciation and amortization is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
we have net property and equipment of  million and insignificant net amortizable intangible assets as of december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our property and equipment  other intangible assets and estimated useful lives 
as of december   we have nonamortizable intangible assets of million and goodwill of million for race event sanctioning and renewal agreements that are considered to have indefinite useful lives because their renewal and cash flow generation is expected to continue indefinitely 
useful lives are estimated based on outside cost segregation and valuation studies conducted on purchased or constructed speedway property and equipment and purchased intangible assets  historical experience  intended use  condition  available information for comparable assets  and other factors and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
management periodically reviews the estimated useful lives used to record depreciation and amortization expense  and believes such estimated useful lives are appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
management also periodically reviews whether non amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets remains appropriate  and believes such non amortization is appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
however  because we have a material investment in depreciable property and equipment and intangible assets  changes in depreciable and amortizable lives  should they occur  could have a significant impact on our financial condition or future results of operations 
realization of receivables and inventories management assesses realization of accounts and notes receivable and inventories  including any need for allowances for doubtful accounts or inventories 
management considers such factors as  among other things  customer creditworthiness  historical collection and sales experience for receivables  and current inventory levels  current speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents and future market demand  and trends and conditions for inventories 
the assessment is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation  which are subject to changes in market and economic conditions  including changes or deterioration in customer financial condition or merchandising distribution and other factors  that might adversely impact realization 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities assuming they will be realized and settled at amounts reported in the financial statements 
income taxes are provided using the liability method whereby deferred income tax estimates  and significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities  reflect management s assessment of future taxes likely to be paid  including timing  probability of realization and other relevant factors 
management s accounting for income taxes reflects its assessment of future tax liabilities based on assumptions and estimates for timing  likelihood of realization  and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation 
at december   net current deferred tax assets totaled million  and net noncurrent deferred tax liabilities totaled million  after reduction for noncurrent deferred tax assets of million 
these net deferred tax liabilities will likely reverse in future years and could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
as of december   valuation allowances of million are provided against deferred tax assets 
management has assessed deferred tax assets  after reduction for valuation allowances  and believes realization is more likely than not 
however  changes in tax laws  assumptions or estimates used in the accounting for income taxes  or changes or adjustments resulting from review by taxing authorities  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on amounts or timing of realization or settlement 
such effects could result in a material acceleration of income taxes currently payable or valuation charges for realization uncertainties  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or future results of operations 
our effective income tax rate was in compared to in as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  our tax rate reflects a non deductible goodwill impairment charge and the positive impact of net decreases in uncertain tax position liabilities of prior years  and our tax rate reflects decreases in income tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions for favorable settlements with taxing authorities 
our effective income tax rates in future years may or may not be impacted by similar or other tax matters  which could result in relative increases or decreases in future income tax expense 
legal proceedings and contingencies as discussed above in legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal matters and intend to continue to defend existing legal actions in fiscal we use a combination of insurance and self insurance to manage various risks associated with our speedways  other properties and motorsports events  and other business risks 
see item a risk factors for additional information on our liability insurance program and self insurance retention 
the likelihood of an adverse outcome and estimation of amounts are assessed using legal counsel on litigation matters  outside insurance administrators and consultants for insured and self insured claims  along with historical trends  assumptions and other information available at the time of assessment 
we accrue a liability for contingencies if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable 
legal and other costs associated with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
management believes amounts requiring accrual are properly reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
management does not believe the outcome of the lawsuits  incidents or other legal or business risk matters will have a material adverse effect on our future financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  new or changes in pending or threatened legal action or claims against us  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of these matters and our future financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
