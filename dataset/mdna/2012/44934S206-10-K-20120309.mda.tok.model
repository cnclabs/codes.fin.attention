item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations overview icad is an industry leading provider of advanced image analysis and workflow solutions that enable radiologists and other healthcare professionals to better serve patients by identifying pathologies and pinpointing cancer earlier 
icad offers a comprehensive range of high performance  expandable computer aided detection cad systems and workflow solutions for mammography film based  digital radiography dr and computed radiography cr  magnetic resonance imaging mri  and computed tomography ct 
icad s solutions aid in the early detection of the most prevalent cancers including breast  prostate and colon cancer 
early detection of cancer is the key to better prognosis  less invasive and lower treatment costs  and higher survival rates 
performed as an adjunct to mammography screening  cad has quickly become the standard of care in breast cancer detection  helping radiologists improve clinical outcomes while enhancing workflow 
computer enhanced breast and prostate mri analysis streamlines case interpretation workflow and generates more robust information for more effective patient treatment 
cad for mammography screening is also reimbursable in the us under federal and most third party insurance programs 
since receiving approval from the fda for the company s first breast cancer detection product in january  over  of icad s cad systems have been placed in mammography practices worldwide 
icad is the only independent company offering cad solutions for the early detection of breast cancer 
the company s cad systems include proprietary algorithm and other technology together with standard computer and display equipment 
cad systems for the film based analog mammography market also include a radiographic film digitizer  either manufactured by the company or others for the digitization of film based medical images 
the company is applying its core competencies in pattern recognition and algorithm development in disease detection to its future product development efforts 
its focus is on the development and marketing of cancer detection products for disease states where there are established or emerging protocols for screening as a standard of care 
icad continues to pursue development or acquisition of products for select disease states that demonstrate one or more of the following it is clinically proven that screening has a significant positive impact on patient outcomes  where there is an opportunity to lower health care costs  where screening is non invasive or minimally invasive and where public awareness is high 
the company also intends to pursue opportunities beyond cad through possible strategic acquisitions as part of its growth strategy  and as such the company continues to actively evaluate strategic opportunities in the oncology market that could leverage its opportunities for growth beyond its historic core markets 
icad has applied its patented detection technology and algorithms to the development of cad solutions for use with virtual colonoscopy or ct colonography ctc to improve the detection of colonic polyps 
the company s pattern recognition and image analysis expertise are readily applicable to colonic polyp detection and the company has developed a ctc cad solution 
ctc is a technology that has evolved rapidly in recent years 
based on the results of the national ct colonography trial  the company expects that the market for virtual colonoscopy will grow along with the procedures for early detection of colon cancer 
this trial demonstrated that ctc is highly accurate for the detection of intermediate and large polyps and that the accuracy of ctc is similar to a colonoscopy 
ctc is emerging as an alternative imaging procedure for evaluation of the colon 
the company has developed and commenced marketing veralook  a product for computer aided detection of polyps in the colon using ctc and completed the clinical testing of its ctc cad product in the first quarter of the company filed a k application with the fda in may seeking fda clearance to market veralook in the u 
s and received fda clearance in august  colorectal cancer has been shown to be highly preventable with early detection and removal of polyps 
in july  the company acquired pharmaco kinetic based cad products that aid in the interpretation of contrast enhanced mri images of the breast and prostate and began marketing these products in the fourth quarter of the interpretation of mri exams also benefits from advanced image analysis and clinical decision support tools 
mri is an excellent tool to detect breast cancer as well as prostate cancer 
while mri is a more expensive option than traditional mammography  it enables physicians to view tumors which may have been missed during routine screenings 
mri uses magnets and radio waves instead of x rays to produce very detailed  cross sectional images of the body  and can be used to look specifically at those areas 
the acquisition of xoft  on december   brought an isotope free cancer treatment platform technology to the company s product line 
xoft designs  develops  manufactures  markets and sells electronic brachytherapy ebx products for the treatment of breast and other cancers  used in a broad range of clinical settings 
the portable axxent system which delivers electronically controlled radiation therapy directly to cancer sites with minimal radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissue is fda cleared 
electronic brachytherapy ebx is a type of brachytherapy that utilizes a miniaturized high dose rate x ray source to apply radiation directly to the cancerous site 
the goal is to direct the radiation dose to the size and shape of the cancerous area  sparing healthy tissue and organs 
the xoft technology delivers similar clinical dose rates to traditional radio active systems 
electronic brachytherapy can be delivered during an operative procedure and may be used as a primary or secondary modality over a course of days 
this technology enables radiation oncology departments in hospitals  clinics and physician offices to perform traditional radiotherapy treatments and provide advanced treatments such as intra operative radiation therapy iort 
current customers for the xoft ebx system include university research and community hospitals  private and governmental institutions  doctors offices  cancer care clinics and veterinary facilities 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows are based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates these estimates  including those related to accounts receivable allowance  inventory valuation and obsolescence  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
additionally  the company uses assumptions and estimates in calculations to determine stock based compensation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory  valuation of long lived and intangible assets  goodwill  stock based compensation  income taxes 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue primarily from the sale of products and from the sale of services and supplies 
revenue is recognized when delivery has occurred  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
for product revenue delivery has occurred upon shipment  provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer 
services and supplies revenue are considered to be delivered as the services are performed or over the estimate life of the supply agreement 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of certain of its mri cad products and services in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  software  revenue recognition asc 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its digital  film based cad and electronic brachytherapy products and services in accordance with asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
in accordance with the guidance of asu  fair value as the measurement criteria is replaced with the term selling price and establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
asu also eliminates the use of the residual value method for determining the allocation of arrangement consideration 
for multi element arrangements  revenue is allocated to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price besp 
vsoe generally exists only when the deliverable is sold separately and is the price actually charged for that deliverable 
the process for determining a besp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors including relative selling prices  competitive prices in the marketplace  and management judgment  however  these may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
sales of the company s electronic brachytherapy product typically include several devices  accessories  service and supply 
the company generally allocates revenue to the deliverables in the arrangement based on the besp 
revenue is recognized when the product has been delivered  and service and supply revenue is recognized over the life of the service and supply agreement 
for most of icad s digital  mri and film based sales  the responsibility for the installation process lies with its original equipment manufacturer oem partners  ge healthcare  siemens medical and others 
on occasion  when icad is responsible for product installation  the installation element is considered a separate unit of accounting because the delivered product has stand alone value to the customer 
in these instances  the company allocates the deliverables based on the framework established within asu therefore  the installation and training revenue is recognized as the services are performed according to the vsoe of the element 
revenue from the digital  mri and film based equipment when there is installation is recognized based on the relative selling price allocation of the besp 
in prior years prior to asu  the company recognized the element on the residual method 
the adoption of asu did not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
the company uses customer purchase orders that include all terms of the arrangement and in the case of oem customers are also supported by distribution agreements 
in accordance with the distribution agreement  the oem customers do not have a right of return  and title and risk of loss passes to the oem customer upon shipment 
the company generally ships free on board shipping point and uses shipping documents and third party proof of delivery to verify delivery and transfer of title 
in addition  the company assesses whether collection is reasonably assured by considering a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer  as obtained from third party credit references 
if the terms of the sale include customer acceptance provisions and compliance with those provisions cannot be demonstrated  all revenues are deferred and not recognized until such acceptance occurs 
the company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in determining when to recognize revenue  including contractual obligations to the customer  the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions  if any  and the installation process 
the company defers revenue from the sale of extended service contracts related to future periods and recognizes revenue on a straight line basis in accordance with fasb asc topic  services 
the company provides for estimated warranty costs on original product warranties at the time of sale 
the company also adopted asc update no 
 certain arrangements that contain software elements update no 

this update amended the scope of asc subtopic no 
 revenue recognition  to exclude tangible products that include software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial results  stability and payment history of each customer 
where appropriate  the company obtains credit rating reports and financial statements of customers when determining or modifying credit limits 
the company s senior management reviews accounts receivable on a periodic basis to determine if any receivables may potentially be uncollectible 
the company includes any accounts receivable balances that it determines may likely be uncollectible  along with a general reserve for estimated probable losses based on historical experience  in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts 
an amount would be written off against the allowance after all attempts to collect the receivable had failed 
based on the information available to the company  it believes the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  is adequate 
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value  with cost determined by the first in  first out method 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and or obsolete inventory primarily based upon estimated usage of its inventory as well as other factors 
long lived assets long lived assets  other than goodwill  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets 
when any such impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of patents  technology intangibles  trade names  customer relationships and distribution agreements purchased in the company s previous acquisitions 
these assets  which include assets acquired from xoft  inc  are amortized on a straight line basis or the pattern of economic benefit over their estimated useful lives of to years 
goodwill in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  asc  the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of the company is less than the carrying value of the company 
the company s goodwill arose in connection with its acquisitions in june  december and december the company operates in one segment and one reporting unit since operations are supported by one central staff and the results of operations are evaluated as one business unit 
in general the company s medical device products are similar in nature based on production  distribution  services provided and regulatory requirements 
the company uses market capitalization as the best evidence of fair value market capitalization is calculated using the quoted closing share price of the company s common stock at its annual impairment testing date of october  multiplied by the number of common shares outstanding of the company 
the company tests goodwill for impairment by comparing its market capitalization fair value to its carrying value 
the fair value of the company is compared to the carrying amount at the same date as the basis to determine if a potential impairment exists 
the company assesses the potential impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and at least annually 
factors the company considers important  which could trigger an impairment of such asset  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or use of the assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in the company s market capitalization below net book value 
during the quarter ended september   as a result of the sustained decline in the market capitalization of the company  an interim step analysis was completed 
the interim step test resulted in the determination that the carrying value of equity exceeded the fair value of equity  thus requiring the company to measure the amount of any goodwill impairment by performing the second step of the impairment test 
the company corroborated the step analysis using an income approach 
the second step defined as step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the guidance in fasb asc intangibles goodwill and other was used to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill 
the guidance provides that if the carrying amount of the company s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill shall be its new accounting basis 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
the excess of the fair value of the single reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied amount of goodwill 
the company identified several intangible assets that were valued during this process  including technology  customer relationships  trade names  non compete agreements  and the company s workforce 
the allocation process was performed only for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
the company determined the value of the select assets utilizing the income approach 
this approach was selected as it measures the income producing assets  primarily technology and customer relationships 
this method estimates the fair value based upon the ability to generate future cash flows  which is particularly applicable when future profit margins and growth are expected to vary significantly from historical operating results 
other significant assumptions include terminal value margin rates  future capital expenditures  and changes in future working capital requirements 
the company also compared and reconciled the overall fair value to the company s market capitalization 
while there are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to the application of these assumptions to this analysis  the income approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the company s single reporting unit 
on december   the company agreed to a settlement related to the litigation with carl zeiss meditec inc and carl zeiss surgical gmbh see note 
the company determined that this settlement should be recorded as a measurement period adjustment and accordingly recorded the present value of the litigation  retrospectively to the opening balance sheet of xoft 
as a result  goodwill increased from approximately million as of december  to million as of december  during the quarter ended  september   the company recorded an impairment loss of approximately million 
however  as a result of recording a measurement period adjustment  the fair value of goodwill was reevaluated 
the step test resulted in determining the fair value of goodwill of million which resulted in an additional impairment loss of  additional  purchase accounting adjustments  considered to be measurement period adjustments  were recorded in the six months subsequent to the acquisition of xoft and consisted primarily of a million decrease of the acquired patent asset  a decrease of  in the acquired technology asset  a decrease in the fair value estimate of the royalty obligation of  and a decrease of  related to contingent consideration and an increase of approximately  related to unrecorded liabilities 
these measurement period adjustments had no effect on the company s operations and results and had an immaterial effect on the december  balance sheet 
accordingly  the adjustments were recorded during  and considered in the impairment analysis during the third quarter of the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended december   are as follows september  twelve months ended december  balance as of december  purchase accounting adjustments impairment balance as of december  no goodwill impairment loss was recorded in for and the company performed the annual step one fair value comparison as of october  and october  at october   the company s market capitalization or market capitalization with a reasonable control premium exceeded its carrying value 
at october   the company s market capitalization with a reasonable control premium was less than the carrying value of goodwill 
however  the company completed a goodwill impairment analysis as of september   and concluded that the october  step one fair value comparison was consistent with the results on september  at december  and the company s market capitalization or market capitalization with a reasonable control premium exceeded its carrying value 
stock based compensation the company maintains stock based incentive plans  under which it provides stock incentives to employees  directors and contractors 
the company grants to employees  directors and contractors  restricted stock and or options to purchase common stock at an option price equal to the market value of the stock at the date of grant 
the company follows fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation  asc  for all stock based compensation 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates  including estimates of the expected term participants will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of its common stock price over the expected term  and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes the company follows the liability method under fasb asc topic  income taxes asc 
the primary objectives of accounting for taxes under asc are to a recognize the amount of tax payable for the current year and b recognize the amount of deferred tax liability or asset for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december  and as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
asc also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  disclosure and transition 
in addition  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and the company revaluates these items quarterly  with any adjustments to preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill  provided that the company is within the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date and continues to collect information in order to determine their estimated values 
subsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the tax allowance s or contingency s estimated value  changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances may affect the provision for income taxes presented in the company s statement of operations
