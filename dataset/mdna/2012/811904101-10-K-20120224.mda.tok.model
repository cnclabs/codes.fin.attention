item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview seacor and its subsidiaries are in the business of owning  operating  investing in and marketing equipment  primarily in the offshore oil and gas  industrial aviation and marine transportation industries 
the company conducts its activities in six primary business segments offshore marine services operates a diversified fleet of offshore support vessels primarily servicing offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production facilities worldwide 
on december   offshore marine services acquired a controlling interest in a european based operator of a fleet of wind farm utility vessels operating in the main offshore wind markets of europe 
aviation services operates and contract leases helicopters that provide transportation services supporting offshore oil and gas activities primarily in the united states  air medical services to hospitals in the united states  and international contract leasing activities 
inland river services is primarily engaged in dry and liquid cargo transportation on the us inland river waterways and the gulf intracoastal waterways for a range of agricultural and industrial products 
marine transportation services operates a fleet of us flag product tankers carrying petroleum  crude oil and chemical products in the us coastwise trade and a fleet of roll on roll off vessels providing cargo transportation services to and from ports in florida  the bahamas and the caribbean 
environmental services is primarily engaged in the provision of emergency preparedness and response services to oil  chemical  industrial and marine transportation clients in the united states and abroad 
commodity trading and logistics is an integrated business involved in the purchase  storage  transportation and sale of agricultural and energy commodities 
other primarily includes harbor and offshore towing services  various other investments in joint ventures  primarily providing industrial air services  and lending and leasing activities 

table of contents the company s business segments  with the exception of environmental services and commodity trading and logistics  are asset related and highly capital intensive 
demand for the company s assets is cyclical in varying degrees due to fluctuations in the activity levels in the industries serviced by those assets  as well as availability of supply 
to manage capital successfully over time  the company continually assesses its asset portfolio and pursues opportunities to realize value from its assets by shifting their operation to other markets or trading them when circumstances warrant 
the company actively leases out and leases in  and buys and sells equipment in the ordinary course of its business 
it also designs  orders  builds  upgrades  operates or re sells newly constructed equipment 
the company typically pursues a strategy of shedding older assets while adjusting its asset mix 
the company also leases assets to other operators and sells assets to financial lessors and leases them back for varying periods of time 
the company believes that maintaining significant liquidity is an important factor that will enable it to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
in recent years  the company has sought to create balance in its businesses and broaden its asset base by investing outside the oil and gas industry in barges  ships tugs and wind farm utility vessels  and by looking for opportunities to engage in logistics support for movement of agricultural and energy commodities 
the company is exploring opportunities to extend its industrial aviation activities through investments in sales  marketing and distribution of aircraft and specialized parts and services  maintenance and repair facilities and fixed base operations 
in addition  the company continues to look to expand in the chinese and indian markets 
the company believes that demand for its barges  tankers  tugs and wind farm utility vessels is  in part  linked to different factors than those that drive demand for offshore oil and gas exploration and development 
in addition  for barges and tankers  contracts can sometimes be secured with longer terms than those typically available for offshore marine and helicopter services 
the expectation is that over time this strategy of diversification will provide better returns on capital than could be achieved by restricting investment to one specific  highly cyclical  asset class such as vessels supporting offshore oil and gas activity 
the company believes this strategy will afford more opportunities to use capital efficiently  create greater stability of earnings and allow improved margins due to operational synergies that in turn  should yield a lower cost of capital  more sustainable cash flows and increased profitability 
deepwater horizon oil spill response the company s operating results for the years ended december  and  were impacted by oil spill response activities relating to the bp macondo well incident in the us gulf of mexico following the sinking of the semi submersible drilling rig deepwater horizon in april the oil spill response 
the impact was material to operating income recorded in both years 
in  at the height of the oil spill response  four of the company s business segments were actively providing support 
environmental services provided i equipment and people to support clean up activities on shore  ii professional assistance  consulting services and software systems in support of incident management activities at various strategic locations  and iii assistance in the provision of manpower for clean up operations throughout the region 
offshore marine services provided i vessels for a variety of functions including vessel decontamination  skimming  lightering  offshore traffic control and accommodation  and ii technical and video equipment on vessels engaged in the response to allow for instant tracking of assets and surveillance of operations 
aviation services provided i helicopters for air support to us coast guard observers undertaking oil spotting and assessment missions  ii transportation for various other officials requiring overflights to assess the response and recovery efforts  and iii a flight tracking system to monitor the movement of all marine and aviation assets involved in the response 
harbor and offshore towing services provided tugs engaged in the decontamination of vessels transiting the region 
oil spill response activity has continued to significantly diminish since december  during  the company s involvement primarily consisted of limited professional services provided by o brien s response management inc  which is part of the company s environmental services business segment 

table of contents as an active participant in the oil spill response  the company has been named in individual and class action litigations involving environmental damage  business and personal injury claims that may result in financial exposure 
for additional information  see item legal proceedings included in part i of this annual report on form k 
in reaction to the deepwater horizon bp macondo well incident  the us department of the interior issued an order on may  imposing a six month moratorium on all offshore deepwater drilling projects 
a preliminary injunction was issued on june  blocking enforcement of the moratorium  however  the us department of interior issued a new moratorium on july  which was lifted on october  the us department of interior has also implemented additional safety and certification requirements for drilling activities  imposed additional requirements for the approval of development and production activities  and delayed the approval of applications to drill in both deepwater and shallow water areas 
the company s results  in particular those of its offshore marine services and aviation services segments  have been adversely impacted as a consequence of reduced drilling activities in the us gulf of mexico

offshore marine services the market for offshore oil and gas drilling has historically been cyclical 
demand tends to be linked to the price of oil and gas and those prices tend to fluctuate based on many factors  including global economic activity and levels of reserves 
price levels for oil and gas can in themselves influence demand 
in addition to the price of oil and gas  the availability of acreage  local tax incentives or disincentives  and requirements for maintaining interests in leases affect activity in the oil and gas industry 
the cyclicality of the market is further exacerbated by the tendency in the industry to order capital assets as demand grows  often resulting in new capacity becoming available just as demand for oil and gas is peaking and activity is about to decline 
offshore market conditions continued to be weak during for the majority of  activity in the us gulf of mexico market continued to be significantly impacted by the aftermath of the deepwater horizon incident in april revised procedures for obtaining drilling permits issued by the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee  formerly the bureau of ocean energy management resulted in limited demand throughout the year 
although activity levels improved during the final quarter when offshore marine services vessels and those of its competitors began returning to work  average day rates are below levels 
margins are further pressured by escalating operating costs  in particular the market for qualified and experienced crew has become more competitive resulting in higher wage rates 
operators are struggling to man reactivated vessels and to meet customer requirements for higher qualified personnel 
the company expects to see a continuation of the upward trends in activity levels and wage pressures during in international markets  the delivery of newly built vessels during has created a situation of oversupply in the north sea  asia  middle east and west africa regions  which is expected to continue during over the last several years  offshore marine services has disposed of its old generation equipment while taking delivery of new vessels specifically designed to meet the changing requirements of the market 
since december   the average age of the fleet  excluding standby safety and wind farm utility vessels  has been reduced from years to years as of december  offshore marine services enters with an increased order book for new equipment and believes its diverse fleet and broad geographical distribution of vessels will assist in weathering the effects of an industry downturn 
the company s strong financial position should enable offshore marine services to capitalize on opportunities as they develop for purchasing  mobilizing or upgrading vessels to meet changing market conditions 

table of contents as of december   in addition to its existing fleet  offshore marine services had new construction projects in progress including one us flag  dp ahts vessel scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of  two foreign flag  dp catamarans scheduled for delivery in the first and third quarters of  two us flag  dp fsvs scheduled for delivery between the first and third quarters of  two foreign flag supply vessels scheduled for delivery between the first and second quarters of and one foreign flag wind farm utility vessel scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of subsequent to december  offshore marine services placed a firm order for the construction of four us flag  dp supply vessels for delivery between the third quarter of and first quarter of on december   offshore marine services acquired a controlling interest in a business that owns and operates vessels primarily used to move personnel and supplies to offshore wind turbines 
the company believes this investment represents an opportunity to diversify its portfolio by providing marine services to non oil and gas related energy development while leveraging off its existing shore based infrastructure in europe  which currently supports standby safety operations in the north sea 
subsequent to december   the company reached an agreement to acquire lift boats from superior energy services  llc and affiliates for million plus a to be determined amount for working capital 
the agreement is subject to certain conditions  including regulatory approval  and is expected to be completed prior to the end of the second quarter of the number and type of vessels operated  their rates per day worked and their utilization levels are the key determinants of offshore marine services operating results and cash flows 
unless a vessel is cold stacked removed from operational service  there is little reduction in daily running costs and  consequently  operating margins are most sensitive to changes in rates per day worked and utilization 
the aggregate cost of offshore marine services operations depends primarily on the size and asset mix of the fleet 
offshore marine services operating costs and expenses are grouped into the following categories personnel primarily wages  benefits  payroll taxes  savings plans and travel for marine personnel  repairs and maintenance primarily routine repairs and maintenance and main engine overhauls which are performed in accordance with planned maintenance programs  drydocking primarily the cost of regulatory drydockings performed in accordance with applicable regulations  insurance and loss reserves primarily the cost of hull and machinery and protection and indemnity insurance premiums and loss deductibles  fuel  lubes and supplies  leased in equipment includes the cost of leasing vessels from lessors under bareboat charter arrangements and leasing equipment employed on vessels  brokered vessel activity the cost of chartering in third party vessels under time charter arrangements to fulfill a customer requirement that cannot be filled by a vessel in the company s fleet  and other communication costs  expenses incurred in mobilizing vessels between geographic regions  third party ship management fees  freight expenses  customs and importation duties  and other 
the company expenses drydocking  engine overhaul and vessel mobilization costs as incurred

aviation services a significant portion of aviation services operations involves transportation services provided to offshore oil and gas customers 
the offshore oil and gas market is highly cyclical with demand linked to the price of oil and gas  which tends to fluctuate depending on many factors  including global economic activity and levels of inventory 
in addition to the price of oil and gas  the availability of acreage and local tax incentives or disincentives and requirements for maintaining interests in leases affect activity levels in the oil and gas industry 
price levels for oil and gas by themselves can cause additional fluctuations by inducing changes in consumer behavior 
during the year ended december   the market for aviation services assets in the us gulf of mexico was disrupted by events related to the sinking of the deepwater horizon drilling rig 
during  the process of issuing permits to drill remained slow and continued to have a negative impact on demand for helicopter services in the us gulf of mexico 
aviation services believes the slowdown will not significantly impact its future results in the us gulf of mexico because its activities are mainly focused on longer term production  maintenance and inspection work rather than on short term exploration and development projects 
for the last five years  aviation services has provided transportation services to government inspectors of offshore drilling rigs and this contract was recently renewed and is expected to run through as of december   of aviation services helicopters were operating under this contract with customer options to increase the number up to helicopters 
prior to the deepwater horizon incident  aviation services had begun to deploy helicopters in international markets  frequently under contract lease arrangements to third parties 
the majority of these helicopters are supporting oil and gas activities in regions of rapidly expanding activity  such as brazil  india and indonesia 
aviation services also has equipment working in the north sea and mexico 
contract leasing affords aviation services the opportunity to access new markets without heavy initial infrastructure investment and generally without ongoing operating risk 
profits derived from contract leasing activities depend on aviation services cost of operations  if applicable  cost of capital  acquisition costs of assets  contract policy and reputation 
as of december   aviation services had helicopters located in foreign jurisdictions compared with helicopters as of december  in the united states  consistent with its diversification strategy  aviation services deploys a number of helicopters in support of other industries and activities  including air medical services and search and rescue services in the u 
s gulf of mexico  which are being developed on a subscription basis 
the aggregate cost of aviation services operations depends primarily on the size and asset mix of the fleet 
aviation services operating costs and expenses are grouped into the following categories personnel includes wages  benefits  payroll taxes  savings plans  subsistence and travel  repairs and maintenance primarily routine activities as well as helicopter refurbishments and engine and major component overhauls that are performed in accordance with planned maintenance programs  insurance and loss reserves the cost of hull and liability insurance premiums and loss deductibles  fuel  leased in equipment includes the cost of leasing helicopters and equipment  and other primarily base expenses  property  sales and use taxes  communication costs  freight expenses  and other 

table of contents aviation services engages a number of third party vendors to maintain the engines and certain components on some of its helicopter models under programs known as power by hour maintenance contracts 
these programs require aviation services to pay for the maintenance service ratably over the contract period  typically based on actual flight hours 
power by hour providers generally bill monthly based on hours flown in the prior month  the costs being expensed as incurred 
in the event aviation services places a helicopter in a program after a maintenance period has begun  it may be necessary to pay an initial buy in charge based on hours flown since the previous maintenance event 
this buy in charge is normally recorded as a prepaid expense and amortized as an operating expense over the remaining power by hour contract period 
if a helicopter is sold or otherwise removed from a program before the scheduled maintenance work is carried out  aviation services may be able to recover part of the company s payments to the power by hour provider  in which case a reduction to operating expense is recorded when the refund is received 
aviation services expenses all repair costs as incurred  which may result in operating expenses varying substantially when compared with a prior year or prior quarter if a disproportionate number of refurbishments or overhauls are undertaken 
this variation can be exacerbated by the timing of entering or exiting third party power by hour programs 
for helicopters that are contract leased to third parties under arrangements whereby the customer assumes operational responsibility  aviation services often provides maintenance and parts support but generally does not incur any other material operating costs 
in most instances  contract leases require clients to procure adequate insurance but aviation services purchases contingent hull and liability coverage to mitigate the risk of a client s coverage failing to respond 
in some instances  aviation services provides crews and other services to support its contract lease customers

the increases were partially offset by a million decrease in operating revenues for activity in support of the oil spill response 
operating revenues in alaska were million lower primarily due to the expiration of a contract with a major oil and gas customer 
operating revenues from contract leasing activities increased by million as additional medium and heavy helicopters were placed on international contract leases 
as of december   aircraft were dedicated to the contract leasing market compared with as of december  operating revenues from medical operations increased by million primarily due to million of additional revenues generated from a new hospital contract and a million increase in activity in support of an existing patient pay customer 
operating revenues for the fbo were million higher primarily due to an increase in fuel sales prices 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million higher for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  personnel costs were million higher as additional personnel were added to support the increased activity discussed above 
repair and maintenance costs increased by million primarily due to enrolling additional helicopters in power by hour maintenance programs 
fuel costs increased by million primarily due to an increase in the price of fuel 
other operating expenses were million higher primarily due to an million increase in support of search and rescue activities  which began in late  a million increase from higher air medical activities and a million increase as a result of providing more parts and repair services to contract leasing customers 
these increases were partially offset by the receipt of million in insurance reimbursements relating to the hurricanes gustav and ike  following final settlement with the company s insurance carriers 
in addition  insurance and loss reserves were million lower primarily due to the receipt of a good experience credit from its hull and machinery underwriters

table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million lower for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  primarily due to a change in estimate of the useful life and salvage value of helicopters  which reduced depreciation expense by million  partially offset by the addition of new and higher cost equipment 
effective july   the company changed its estimated useful life and salvage value for helicopters from to years and to  respectively  due to improvements in new aircraft models that continue to increase their long term value and make them viable for operation over a longer period of time

operating income 
excluding gains on asset dispositions and impairments  operating income as a percentage of operating revenues was consistent in both periods at 
compared with operating revenues 
operating revenues were million lower for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  operating revenues in the us gulf of mexico were million lower primarily due to a million decrease driven by a reduction in the number of aircraft operating in the region and lower flight hours supporting oil and gas activities following the deepwater horizon incident 
these reductions were partially offset by revenues of million generated by equipment contracted to the us coast guard in support of the oil spill response 
operating revenues in alaska were million higher primarily due to an increase in the number of helicopters on contract in support of oil and gas activities 
operating revenues from contract leasing activities increased by million as additional aircraft were placed on international contract leases  primarily in brazil 
as of december   aircraft were dedicated to the contract leasing market compared with as of december  operating revenues from air medical services were million lower due to the non renewal of several contracts upon their conclusion 
operating revenues for the fbo were million lower primarily due to the loss of a significant customer during operating expenses 
operating expenses were million lower for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  personnel costs were million lower primarily due to a million reduction in wage and benefit costs for air medical services in line with reduced activity and a million reduction in crew subsistence costs in the us gulf of mexico 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in wage and benefit costs in alaska in support of additional helicopters on contract 
repair and maintenance costs were million higher primarily due to a million increase as additional aircraft were placed in power by hour maintenance contracts and a million increase due to the timing of major repairs  partially offset by a million reduction in maintenance spending in air medical services as a result of fewer contracts 
fuel expenses decreased by million primarily due to a reduction in fbo fuel sales 
other operating expenses were million higher primarily due to the receipt of million in insurance reimbursements in for expenses incurred following hurricanes gustav and ike in this was partially offset by a million reduction in costs attributable to a firefighting contract completed in administrative and general 
administrative and general expenses were million higher for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  primarily due to million in higher wage and benefit costs and the reversal of a million provision for doubtful accounts following its collection 

table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense was million higher for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  primarily due to the continued modernization of the fleet through the addition of new and higher cost equipment 
operating income

excluding the impact of these items  operating income as a percentage of operating revenues was in inland river services historically  activity levels for grain exports and non grain imports are the key drivers in determining freight rates 
domestic corn production has declined for two consecutive years resulting in a negative impact on river export volumes  which fell by over in compared with the weakness in the grain export markets in was somewhat offset by a significant improvement in the coal export market 
the united states has traditionally been a residual exporter of coal and in rising demand in china and production issues in other exporting countries combined to push mississippi coal exports to over million tons  up from eight million tons in the improvements in the coal freight markets led some operators to switch their barges to carry coal instead of grain 
this reduced the available supply of grain barges and helped to support grain freight rates 
weather conditions again presented challenges to the industry during excessive rain in the corn belt throughout the spring and early summer delayed planting  stunted crop growth  flooded thousands of acres of farmland and pushed commodity prices to record highs 
the spring floods were particularly troublesome 
river locks were periodically closed  river traffic was halted to protect levee integrity  shippers were forced to cease operations  tow sizes were limited and fuel efficiency was reduced

inland river services believes that approximately of the dry cargo barge fleet operating on the us inland river waterways is over years old 
inland river services believes the relatively young age of its dry cargo barge fleet enhances its availability and reliability  reduces downtime for repairs and obviates  for the immediate future  the necessity of replacement capital expenditures to maintain its fleet size and revenue generating capacity 
the aggregate cost of inland river services operations depends primarily on the size and mix of its fleet 
inland river services operating costs and expenses are grouped into the following categories barge logistics primarily towing  switching  fleeting and cleaning costs  personnel primarily wages  benefits  payroll taxes  savings plans and travel for marine personnel  repairs and maintenance primarily repairs and maintenance on towboats  which are performed in accordance with planned maintenance programs  insurance and loss reserves primarily the cost of hull and machinery  protection and indemnity and cargo insurance premiums and loss deductibles  fuel  lubes and supplies  leased in equipment includes the cost of leasing equipment  including bought in freight and towboats  from lessors under bareboat charter arrangements  and other rail car logistics  property taxes and other

the company records write downs  as needed  to adjust the carrying amount of inventories to the lower of cost or market 
property and equipment 
equipment  stated at cost  is depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset to an estimated salvage value 
with respect to each class of asset  the estimated useful life is typically based upon a newly built asset being placed into service and represents the point at which it is typically not justifiable for the company to continue to operate the asset in the same or similar manner 
from time to time  the company may acquire older assets that have already exceeded the company s useful life policy  in which case the company depreciates such assets based on its best estimate of remaining useful life  typically the next survey or certification date 
as of december   the estimated useful life in years of each of the company s major classes of new equipment was as follows offshore support vessels helicopters inland river dry cargo and deck barges inland river liquid tank barges inland river towboats us flag tankers roro vessels harbor and offshore tugs ocean liquid tank barges effective july   the company changed its estimated useful life and salvage value for helicopters from to years and to  respectively  due to improvements in new aircraft models that continue to increase their long term value and make them viable for operation over a longer period of time

impairment of or less owned companies 
the company performs regular reviews of each investee s financial condition  the business outlook for its products and services  and its present and projected results and cash flows 
when an investee has experienced consistent declines in financial performance or difficulties in raising capital to continue operations  and when the company expects the decline to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to fair value

goodwill 
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill and further periodic tests to the extent indicators of impairment develop between annual impairment tests 
the company s impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including the goodwill related to the reporting unit 
to determine the fair value of the reporting unit  the company uses a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates for revenues  costs and appropriate discount rates  among others 
these estimates are reviewed each time the company tests goodwill for impairment and are typically developed as part of the company s routine business planning and forecasting process 
while the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  variations from those estimates could produce materially different results 
business combinations 
the company recognizes  with certain exceptions  percent of the fair value of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and non controlling interests when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity 
shares issued in consideration for a business combination  contingent consideration arrangements and pre acquisition loss and gain contingencies are all measured and recorded at their acquisition date fair value
