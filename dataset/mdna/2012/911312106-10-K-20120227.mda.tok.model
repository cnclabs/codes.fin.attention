item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the slow pace of the us economic recovery in put pressure during the first three quarters of the year on volume and revenue growth in our us domestic package segment  as well as us import volume in our international package and supply chain freight segments 
slower growth in industrial production and the lack of significant inventory rebuilding also pressured our volume in certain industrial sectors  however  overall growth in retail sales  particularly in e commerce  resulted in solid business to consumer shipment activity during the year 
growth accelerated in the fourth quarter of due in large part to a strong holiday season for e commerce sales  which resulted in higher volume and revenue for our deferred and ground residential products 
outside of the us  economic growth slowed throughout due to volatility in world markets 
despite this sluggish economic environment  we experienced favorable volume and revenue growth for most of the year  although the growth trend slowed during the latter half of in  we continued to undertake initiatives to improve yield management  increase operational efficiency and contain costs  which led to solid improvements in operating margin and profit in our us domestic package and supply chain freight segments 
during  we completed the second phase of our worldport expansion which has allowed the use of larger and more fuel efficient aircraft  and further improved network efficiencies 
we also streamlined our us domestic management structure and continued to better align our cost structure with prevailing volume levels 
in our international package segment  we have continued to invest to support our growth initiatives 
in  we opened our new intra asia air hub in shenzhen  china  which has allowed us to better serve our customers by reducing time in transit for shipments in the region 
we have also continued to optimize our aircraft network  to leverage the new route authority we have gained over the last several years and to take full advantage of faster growing trade lanes 
in asia  we expanded our air network during by adding flights from hong kong to cologne  germany  adding a daily flight from chengdu  china to cologne  and adding new routes from japan  as well as increasing our capacity to serve the south korea to us trade lane by adding a flight to and from incheon 
in europe  we announced a million expansion of our cologne hub in germany in  which will increase the hub s sorting capacity from  to  packages per hour when completed in in the americas  we have expanded our air capacity more than on weekly flights into key markets in central and south america during even though we continue to experience solid overall growth in our international package business  in the latter half of  we experienced weakness in the important asia to us trade lane 
to align our capacity and cost structure with prevailing volume levels  we reduced our tonnage capacity in this lane  while retaining the network enhancements and service upgrades previously implemented 
volatile fuel prices have continued to impact both revenue and expense in all three of our segments 
rising fuel prices have led to higher fuel surcharge rates and increased fuel and purchased transportation costs

these mark to market losses for  and primarily resulted from decreases in the discount rates used to value our projected benefit obligations in each year 
these charges impacted each of our three reporting segments in and  and our international package segment in restructuring charge in  we streamlined the management structure in our us domestic package segment  and incurred a restructuring charge associated with this reorganization 
this pre tax charge totaled million million after tax  and reflects the value of voluntary retirement benefits  severance benefits and unvested stock compensation 
gain on sales of businesses in  we sold our ups logistics technologies business unit within our supply chain freight segment  and recognized a pre tax gain of million million after tax 
also in  we sold a specialized 
table of contents transportation business in germany within our supply chain freight segment  and incurred a pre tax loss on the sale of million million after tax  which includes a fair value adjustment loss due to a financial guarantee associated with this business sale 
gains on real estate transactions in  we recognized a net million pre tax gain million after tax on a consolidated basis on certain real estate transactions consisting of a million pre tax gain in our supply chain freight segment  and a million pre tax loss in our us domestic package segment 
in  we recognized a pre tax gain of million million after tax on the sale of real estate within our us domestic package segment 
aircraft impairment charges in  we completed an impairment assessment of our mcdonnell douglas dc aircraft fleet  and recorded an impairment charge of million million after tax  which affected our us domestic package segment 
this charge  as well as our accounting policies pertaining to long lived assets  is discussed further in critical accounting policies and estimates 
currency remeasurement charge during  we incurred a million non cash  pre tax currency remeasurement charge million after tax on certain foreign currency denominated obligations 
charge for change in tax filing status for german subsidiary in  we changed the tax status of a german subsidiary that was taxable in the us and its local jurisdiction to one that is solely taxed in its local jurisdiction 
as a result of this change in tax status  we recorded a non cash charge of million to income tax expense  which resulted primarily from the write off of related deferred tax assets which will not be realizable following the change in tax status 
results of operations segment review the results and discussions that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments 
we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles gaap with certain non gaap financial measures  including operating profit  operating margin  pre tax income  net income and earnings per share adjusted for the non comparable items discussed previously 
we believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance 
we believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of  or are unrelated to  our core operating results  and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses

business to consumer shipments  which 
table of contents represent approximately of total us domestic package volume  experienced stronger growth than commercial volume 
volume growth accelerated in the fourth quarter  with average daily volume increasing over the fourth quarter of among our air products  we experienced a increase in next day and second day air package volume  as a result of retail sales growth  with particular growth in our next day air saver product 
air letter volume declined  largely due to weakness in the financial and other service industries 
within ground  our light weight products  which target low cost  non urgent ground residential deliveries  experienced solid growth during during the fourth quarter of  volume growth accelerated to and in our deferred and ground products  respectively  compared with the fourth quarter of these increases were primarily driven by higher business to consumer shipment growth during the holiday season 
compared to in  our overall volume increased as improvements in industrial production and retail sales increased overall demand in the us small package market 
among our air products  next day and second day air package volume increased as inventory rebuilding in the manufacturing and retailing sectors contributed to growth 
however  our letter volume declined largely due to weakness in the financial and other service industries 
the growth in ground volume was driven by increased volume from the manufacturing and retailing sectors 
rates and product mix compared to overall revenue per piece increased for our ground and air products during due to a combination of base price increases and fuel surcharge rate changes  which are discussed further below 
the overall revenue per piece increase was also positively affected by our focus on revenue management initiatives 
in addition  the revenue per piece increase for our air products was positively impacted by the overall mix shift from letters to packages 
comparing the fourth quarter of with  the average revenue per piece increase slowed to due to the higher volume of lighter weight business to consumer packages 
revenue per piece for our ground and air products was also impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on january  we increased the base rates on ups next day air  ups nd day air  and ups day select  and on ups ground  while reducing our fuel surcharge indexes discussed further below 
other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge  and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes

table of contents fuel surcharges ups applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services 
the air fuel surcharge is based on the us department of energy s doe gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel  while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the doe s on highway diesel fuel price 
based on published rates  the average fuel surcharge for domestic air and ground products was as follows year ended december  point change next day air deferred ground in connection with our base rate increase on january   we modified the fuel surcharge on air and ground services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by and  respectively 
in connection with a base rate increase on january   we modified the fuel surcharge on air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 
the and increases in the air and ground fuel surcharges were due to the significant increases in jet and diesel fuel prices each year  but partially offset by the reductions in the index on the air and ground surcharges in and the index on the air surcharge in total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by and million in and  respectively  primarily due to the higher fuel surcharge rates discussed above 
operating expenses compared to overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased million in compared with  while the total adjusted cost per piece increased for the year 
a large component of this increase relates to the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network  which increased million in due largely to higher fuel costs  as well as an increase in aircraft repair and maintenance expenses and higher rates passed to us from outside transportation carriers  primarily railroads 
pickup and delivery costs increased million in compared to  primarily as a result of higher fuel prices and a union contractual driver wage increase 
cost increases have been mitigated due to network efficiencies that we have achieved  as we adjust our air and ground networks to better match volume levels  and continued to utilize our expanded worldport facility to operate larger aircraft and to increase package sorting efficiency 
these network efficiency improvements resulted in a reduction in total labor hours and a reduction in miles driven in compared with increased delivery densities as a result of improved planning and technology  and growth in our surepost product  have also contained increases in cost 
compared to overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased million in compared with  while the total adjusted cost per piece decreased for the year 
network costs increased million in due largely to higher fuel costs 
pickup and delivery costs increased million for the year  primarily as a result of higher fuel prices and a union contractual driver wage increase 
sort costs increased million for the year  largely due to contractual union wage increases as well as higher depreciation expense for certain operating facilities  including our worldport hub 
network efficiencies were achieved in  as we adjusted our air and ground networks to better match volume levels  and increased our package sorting efficiency 
improved pick up and delivery densities also increased productivity in our operations 
these network efficiency improvements resulted in a reduction in direct labor hours  a reduction in aircraft block hours and a reduction in miles driven in compared with in addition to these factors  management salary costs declined as a result of a decrease in the total number of management employees through attrition combined with voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions 

table of contents operating profit and margin compared to higher adjusted operating profit during compared with was driven by the increased network efficiencies  combined with strong improvements in revenue per piece and a small increase in volume 
fourth quarter adjusted operating profit was particularly strong  with adjusted operating margins of in comparison to in the fourth quarter of strong volume growth in the business to consumer sector  along with solid cost control and strong network efficiencies  were the primary factors for the fourth quarter performance 
compared to adjusted operating profit in was positively impacted by the overall economic growth in the us  which drove increased volume and yields

table of contents revenue the change in overall revenue was impacted by the following factors for the years ended december  and  compared with the prior years volume rates product mix fuel surcharge currency total revenue change revenue change drivers vs vs volume compared to export volume increased in compared to  primarily due to strong growth in key markets in europe and the americas 
our transborder products experienced strong growth  particularly in key countries within europe 
volume for our premium worldwide express and worldwide expedited products increased as well  particularly in the asia to europe  europe to americas and europe to asia export trade lanes 
additionally  intra asia export volume experienced solid growth during compared with  and was impacted by the continued economic growth in asia overall 
our export volume growth slowed in the latter half of  largely due to decelerating growth in exports out of china and the rest of asia  as well as difficult comparisons with a relatively strong latter half of non us domestic volume increases were driven by continued strong growth in key markets  including germany  france and poland 
compared to export volume increased for  as the worldwide economy and world trade continued to improve 
we experienced strong growth in asia  where volume grew due to a combination of regional economic growth and geographic expansion of our service offerings 
european export volume also had strong growth for  increasing compared with  due to market share gains  economic growth in certain key markets  and an overall expansion of trade in the european union 
us origin export volume also had solid growth during our premium worldwide express and expedited products grew at a relatively faster rate than our standard transborder and trade direct products 
non us domestic volume increased for  due in part to the acquisition of unsped paket servisi san ve ticaret as unsped in turkey in the third quarter of excluding the acquisition of unsped  non us domestic volume increased  led by the strength in core european markets  canada and mexico 
rates and product mix compared to total average revenue per piece increased for on a currency adjusted basis 
export revenue per piece increased  largely due to a combination of higher fuel surcharge rates and base rate increases  which are discussed further below 
currency adjusted export revenue per piece increased for compared with product mix adversely impacted export revenue per piece  due to strong growth among our lower yielding transborder products 
revenue per piece was pressured as average trade lanes shortened  due to volume declines in the higher yielding asia to us export lane  and higher volume growth among the relatively lower yielding intra europe and intra asia export lanes 
domestic revenue per piece increased on a currency adjusted basis for  largely due to comparatively faster growth in our premium express products

rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 
compared to export revenue per piece increased during  largely due to higher fuel surcharge rates  base rate increases and product mix 
export revenue per piece increased as higher yielding products such as worldwide express and worldwide expedited grew at a relatively faster pace 
in  we experienced an overall lengthening of trade lanes  as inter regional trade increased especially in our asia to europe and asia to us export lanes  leading to relatively stronger growth for our premium products 
the impact of currency  net of hedging  resulted in a decrease to revenue growth during the year 
domestic revenue per piece decreased  primarily due to the impact of lower yielding domestic packages from the unsped acquisition

fuel surcharges in connection with our base rate increases on january  and january   we modified the fuel surcharges on certain us related international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by in each of the two years 
the fuel surcharges for products originating outside the united states continue to be indexed to fuel prices in the international region where the shipment takes place 
total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by and million in and  respectively  due to higher fuel surcharge rates caused by increased fuel prices as well as an increase in international air volume 
operating expenses compared to overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased billion in compared with the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes resulted in an adverse impact on operating expense comparisons between and of million 
excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes  the total adjusted cost per piece for the segment increased for the year 
the increase in adjusted operating expenses  excluding the impact of currency  was largely due to the increased cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network  and also higher pick up and delivery costs 
network costs increased million for the year  largely due to higher fuel costs and increased block hours  as well as an increase in aircraft repair and maintenance expenses 
pick up and delivery costs increased million for the year  primarily as a result of higher fuel prices and increased package volume

network costs increased million for the year due largely to higher fuel costs and increased block hours 
pick up and delivery costs increased million for the year  primarily as a result of higher fuel prices and increased package volume 
package sorting expenses increased million  and were impacted by higher labor costs and increased depreciation on certain operating facilities 
operating profit and margin compared to adjusted operating profit increased slightly in compared with  while the segment operating margin declined for the year due to several factors 
the overall increase in adjusted operating profit was largely due to the volume and revenue per piece increases previously discussed  however  the impact of these items was largely offset by excess capacity and the adverse impact of fuel prices and currency exchange rate movements 
volume softness in the asia to us trade lane in the latter half of resulted in excess transportation capacity  which pressured margins while our transportation network was being adjusted for the slowing demand 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates net of our hedging programs resulted in an adverse impact on operating profit comparisons between and of million 
additionally  fuel prices adversely impacted the operating profit comparison between and  as fuel expense increased at a faster pace than fuel surcharge revenue 
these factors resulted in a decrease in the operating margin in compared with compared to the increase in operating profit for was primarily driven by volume increases in all major regions and trade lanes worldwide 
the shift in product mix to our higher margin premium services also contributed to the increase in operating profits

revenue compared to forwarding and logistics revenue increased in compared with  primarily due to growth in our logistics services  where we experienced solid growth in our mail services  retail and health care solutions 
forwarding revenue decreased primarily due to volume and tonnage declines in our air and ocean forwarding businesses  as well as lower third party transportation carrier rates 
the tonnage decrease was mainly the result of revenue management initiatives that improve the matching of customer pricing with market conditions  as well as the impact of the global economic slowdown 
freight revenue increased in  primarily due to growth in ltl shipments  an increase in base rates  and increased fuel surcharge rates 
ltl shipments per day increased in  largely due to improving ltl market conditions in the first half of the year and an increase in market share 
however  volume declined in the latter half of the year  and was impacted by our focus on yield management and also due to the overall ltl market being adversely impacted by the slowing economy 
ltl revenue per hundredweight increased  primarily as a result of a base rate increase that took effect during the year  negotiated increases on existing contract rates and 
table of contents higher fuel surcharge rates  as total fuel surcharge revenue increased million for the year driven by higher diesel fuel prices 
an increase in base prices took effect on august   as our freight unit increased minimum charge  ltl and tl rates an average of  covering non contractual shipments in the united states  canada and mexico 
the other businesses within supply chain freight experienced an increase in revenue  primarily due to growth at ups capital  the ups store  ups customer solutions and our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the us postal service 
compared to forwarding and logistics revenue increased in  primarily due to growth in the demand for forwarding as a result of the continued expansion of the worldwide economy  inventory rebuilding and world trade 
in our forwarding business  both air freight and ocean freight experienced solid revenue growth  due primarily to higher volumes  fuel surcharges  and other accessorial charges 
international air freight tonnage increased for compared with the prior year 
in our logistics products  we experienced growth in mail services and distribution revenue  with solid increases being achieved in the health care and technology sectors 
freight revenue increased  primarily due to higher fuel surcharge rates and a base rate increase that took effect in january average ltl shipments per day  weight per shipment and ltl revenue per hundredweight all increased during the year  largely due to our strategy of maintaining our focus on yields and targeting certain customer segments 
the increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was primarily due to an increase in base prices that took effect in january  as ups freight increased minimum charge  ltl and tl rates an average of  covering non contractual shipments in the united states  canada  and mexico 
an additional rate increase took effect october  additionally  ltl revenue per hundredweight increased as a result of higher fuel surcharge rates  as total fuel surcharge revenue increased million for the year primarily resulting from higher diesel fuel prices 
the other businesses within supply chain freight experienced an increase in revenue 
a primary driver of this increase was our ups customer solutions business  which provides a range of services eg project management  industrial engineering  transportation fleet services  distribution network analysis  package engineering  and package visibility 
operating expenses compared to forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses were flat in compared with purchased transportation expense declined by million in  due to lower air freight volume as well as lower rates passed to us from third party transportation carriers 
the reduction in third party carrier rates was largely due to over capacity in the asia to us trade lane that began in the latter half of and continued into the first half of this reduction in purchased transportation costs was offset by increases in several other expense categories  including other occupancy costs  depreciation and amortization  repairs and maintenance  and other expenses 
freight operating expenses increased million for on an adjusted basis  with the total cost per ltl shipment increasing for the year 
the two largest components of this increase relate to the cost of operating our linehaul network  which increased million in  and pick up  delivery and dock costs  which increased million for the year 
we incurred higher fuel costs operating our vehicle fleet  as well as higher fuel surcharge rates passed to us from outside transportation carriers  as a result of higher diesel fuel prices and increased volume 
additionally  compensation and benefit costs increased primarily as a result of higher pension and health care costs  and effective wage increases of for drivers in our linehaul network 
table of contents and for drivers and dock workers in our pick up and delivery network 
these expense increases were somewhat offset by improved productivity measures  including pick up and delivery stops per hour  dock bills per hour and improved linehaul network utilization 
expenses for the other businesses within supply chain freight increased million in compared to  and the increases were spread among several operating expense categories and business units 
compared to forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses increased million in compared with  due to several factors 
purchased transportation costs increased by million in  largely due to a strong increase in tonnage in our air and ocean forwarding businesses  as well as rapidly escalating rates on air freight due to capacity constraints from outside carriers in the first half of the capacity constraints in the air freight business began to recede in the second half of  and the increases in purchased transportation costs lessened 
cost controls partly offset the purchased transportation expense growth  as total compensation and benefits expense declined million and other occupancy expense declined by million  among other factors 
the decrease in compensation and benefits expense was impacted by reduced pension expense  while the decline in other occupancy expense was largely due to lower rent expense on warehouses and other facilities 
freight adjusted operating expenses increased million in compared with  while the total cost per ltl shipment increased for year 
the two largest components of this increase relate to the cost of operating our linehaul network which increased million in compared with  and pick up  delivery and dock costs which increased million for the year 
we incurred higher fuel costs operating our vehicle fleet  as well as higher fuel surcharge rates passed to us from outside transportation carriers  as a result of higher diesel fuel prices and increased volume

these expense increases were somewhat offset by improved productivity measures  including pick up and delivery stops per hour  dock bills per hour and improved linehaul network utilization 
adjusted operating expenses for the other businesses within supply chain freight increased by million for compared with  largely due to a gain recorded in recorded as a reduction to operating expenses on the sale of substantially all our international mail boxes etc 
operations 
operating profit and margin compared to the forwarding and logistics unit experienced an million increase in adjusted operating profit in compared with  largely due to revenue management initiatives and cost containment in our forwarding unit  which improved operating leverage 
additionally  excess market capacity  especially in the asia to us trade lane  reduced our purchased transportation costs and improved the operating profitability in this business 
our logistics business had a small decrease in operating profit in  primarily due to our continued investment in expanding our global health care capabilities 
our freight unit had an increase of million in adjusted operating profit in compared with  primarily due to increased yields  volume growth and improved productivity in our operations 
the combined operating income for all of our other businesses in this segment increased million in  primarily due to improved results at our ups capital unit 
compared to adjusted operating profit in the forwarding and logistics units increased by million in compared with as a result of several factors 
the operating profit increase in the forwarding unit was largely due to a 
table of contents strong increase in tonnage in our air and ocean forwarding businesses  but was partially offset by capacity constraints from outside carriers in the first half of capacity constraints led to rapidly escalating rates on air freight which could not be passed on to customers in a timely manner  resulting in a negative impact to our operating profit and margin 
this situation improved during the second half of  as capacity constraints lessened and we were able to implement revenue management plans which better matched customer pricing with market conditions 
our logistics unit had a solid increase in profitability in  which was driven primarily by an expansion of operating margins due to operating efficiencies and a focus on higher margin industry sectors 
adjusted operating profit for our ups freight unit increased by million in compared with the prior year  largely due to better productivity  and increases in base pricing and volume 
productivity metrics increased  including increases in pickup and delivery stops per hour and linehaul utilization 
all of the remaining businesses combined within this segment increased adjusted operating profit by million during the year  primarily due to improved results in our ups capital business unit

management payroll costs declined slightly primarily due to a lower management incentive award 
adjusted benefits expense increased million in compared with  primarily due to higher employee health and welfare costs and expense associated with our self insurance for worker s compensation claims  but partially offset by a decline in pension expense 
these factors are discussed further as follows employee health and welfare program costs increased million in  and were impacted by higher required union plan contribution rates and general health care inflation 

table of contents the expense associated with our self insurance programs for worker s compensation claims increased by million in insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
insurance reserves also take into account a number of factors including our history of claim losses  payroll growth and the impact of safety improvement initiatives 
in  we experienced more favorable actuarial expense adjustments compared with  thus leading to the increase in expense in adjusted pension expense decreased million in due to several factors 
most significantly  contributions to the company sponsored pension plans in increased the expected return on assets used for expense calculation purposes 
the increase in the expected return on assets more than offset increased service and interest costs due to a decline in discount rates  resulting in a net reduction in pension expense 
this was partially offset by higher contribution rates for multiemployer pension plans  as well as the reinstatement of matching contributions to our primary employee defined contribution savings plan 
compared to the increase in adjusted compensation and benefits expense in compared with was impacted by several items 
payroll costs increased million  largely due to higher accruals for management incentive compensation plans resulting from improved company financial results 
union payroll costs also increased due to contractual wage increases 
these factors were partially offset by a decline in union labor hours  as well as a reduction in management salary costs resulting from a decrease in the total number of management employees through attrition combined with voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions 
adjusted benefits expense increased million in compared with  due largely to increases in health and welfare costs and relocation related benefits for management employees 
the increase in health and welfare costs  which was primarily driven by health cost inflation  was somewhat mitigated by reductions in the total number of management employees and union employees covered by ups sponsored health and welfare benefit plans 
the relocation benefit costs relate to the restructuring of our domestic package operations that occurred in the first quarter of these increases were largely offset by a reduction in pension expense  due to an increase in the expected return on assets more than offsetting increasing service and interest costs 
the increased expected return on assets was largely due to significant contributions to company sponsored pension plans in repairs and maintenance compared to the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was largely due to aircraft maintenance costs  which increased million in compared with this increase resulted from an increase in flight hours due to higher air volume  additional scheduled maintenance checks and higher contractual maintenance rates 
the remaining increase in repairs and maintenance expense primarily relates to higher maintenance costs on our office buildings and operating facilities 
compared to the increase in repairs and maintenance expense in compared with was largely due to maintenance costs on our vehicle fleet  which increased by million during the year 
the remaining increase in repairs and maintenance expense was largely due to higher maintenance costs on our aircraft fleet and operating facilities 

table of contents depreciation and amortization compared to the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in was primarily the result of a reduction in depreciation expense on technology equipment and software 
this decline was primarily related to certain technology hardware and capitalized software becoming fully depreciated 
compared to depreciation and amortization expense increased in  primarily as a result of depreciation expense on equipment and facilities capitalized in conjunction with the recent worldport expansion 
amortization of intangible assets also increased as a result of new intangibles recognized related to the unsped acquisition in turkey in the third quarter of  as well as corporate sponsorships entered into in purchased transportation compared to the increase in purchased transportation in was caused by a combination of higher volume  as well as increased fuel surcharges and base rates charged to us by third party air  ocean and truck carriers across all segments 
the combination of these factors increased expense by million in additionally  we incurred a million increase in expense in for the use of rail carriers  which was due primarily to higher rates and fuel surcharges  as well as increased volumes 
the remaining increase in expense for was primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate changes 
compared to the increase in purchased transportation in was caused by several factors  including higher volume  as well as increased fuel surcharges and base rates charged to us by third party air  ocean and truck carriers 
the combination of these factors increased expense by billion in compared with additionally  the expense for the use of rail carriers increased million  which was due primarily to higher rates and fuel surcharges  as well as increased volumes 
partially offsetting these increases in expense for was the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
fuel compared to the increase in fuel expense in compared with was primarily caused by higher prices for jet a fuel  diesel and unleaded gasoline  which increased expense by million 
higher usage of these products in our operations accounted for the remaining increase in expense of million in compared to in  higher prices for jet a fuel  diesel  and unleaded gasoline increased fuel expense by million compared with  while greater fuel usage increased expense by million 
other occupancy compared to other occupancy expense increased in compared with  primarily due to an increase in utilities expense resulting from increased electricity costs in our facilities 
the remainder of the increase is primarily due to higher rent expense resulting from increased rates on warehouses 

table of contents compared to the decrease in other occupancy expense in compared with was primarily due to decreased labor and overhead expenses  and lower rent expense on leased facilities 
other expenses compared to the increase in adjusted other expenses in compared with was caused by several factors  including foreign currency remeasurement losses  advertising costs  employee expense reimbursements  equipment rentals  air cargo handling costs and data processing fees 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt and employee relocation expenses 
compared to the decrease in adjusted other expenses in compared with was largely due to reductions in bad debt expense and foreign currency transaction expense  which reflected gains during compared to losses in additionally  we incurred a loss on the sale of a french repair business in additional expense reductions in were due to cost containment programs  including reductions in telecom costs  office supplies  and outside professional fees 
we also incurred lower expenses associated with auto liability insurance and customer claims for lost or damaged packages 
investment income and interest expense the following table sets forth investment income and interest expense for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  change investment income n a interest expense impact of currency remeasurement charge adjusted interest expense investment income the increase in investment income in compared with was caused by a combination of factors 
during  we realized million in net gains on the sales of auction rate securities  preferred equity securities and an s p index fund  as well as a mark to market gain on investments 
in  we recorded a million impairment on certain asset backed auction rate securities  which resulted from provisions that allowed the issuers of the securities to subordinate our holdings to newly issued debt or to tender for the securities at less than their par value 
additionally in  we recorded an million loss on the sale of auction rate securities 
the remaining change in investment income was caused by a lower yield earned on our invested assets  however  this was largely offset by a higher average balance of interest earning investments in our portfolio 
the decrease in investment income in was primarily due to a lower yield earned on our invested assets as a result of declines in short term interest rates in the united states  as well as higher impairment losses on our holdings of auction rate and preferred securities 
interest expense interest expense declined slightly in due to a lower average interest rate incurred on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps  which reduced expense by million for compared with however  this was largely offset as a result of a higher average balance of outstanding debt in compared with 
table of contents the decrease in adjusted interest expense in compared with was primarily due to lower average debt balances  but this was partially offset by lower capitalized interest  due to the recent completion of several large construction projects  including our worldport expansion 
income tax expense the following table sets forth income tax expense and our effective tax rate for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  change income tax expense income tax impact of pension and postretirement benefit plans mark to market charge change in tax filing status for german subsidiary restructuring charge gain on sales of businesses gain on real estate transactions aircraft impairment charge currency remeasurement charge adjusted income tax expense effective tax rate adjusted effective tax rate compared to adjusted income tax expense increased primarily due to higher pre tax income 
our adjusted effective tax rate declined in compared with as a result of several factors  including changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances  the relative proportion of taxable income in certain non us jurisdictions  and favorable developments with non us state tax audit and litigation matters 
compared to the increase in our effective tax rate in compared with was attributable to the higher marginal tax rate applied to the gain on the sale of real estate  as well as the change in the tax filing status of a german subsidiary that occurred in the first quarter of additionally  we were unable to recognize the entire potential tax benefit of tax loss carryforwards generated from the sale of a supply chain freight business in germany in the first quarter of excluding these items  our adjusted effective tax rate decreased in compared to primarily due to the effect of having a higher proportion of our taxable income in being subject to tax outside the united states  where statutory tax rates are generally lower

cash from operating activities remained strong throughout the to time period 
operating cash flow was favorably impacted in  compared with  by higher net income  changes in our working capital position  the timing of income tax payments and the amount of contributions into our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the favorable changes in working capital were impacted by the change in the timing of the elective awards under our management incentive awards program  which shifted the payout of million in awards from to the first quarter of the change in the cash flows for income tax receivables and payables in and was primarily related to the timing of discretionary pension contributions during  as discussed further in the following paragraph 
except for discretionary or accelerated fundings of our plans  contributions to our company sponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans 
in  we made a billion contribution to the ups ibt pension plan  which satisfied our contribution requirements and also approximately million in contributions that would not have been required until after in  operating cash flow was reduced by billion in discretionary contributions to our ups retirement and ups pension plans  and million in required contributions to our ups ibt pension plan 
in  operating cash flow was reduced by million in required contributions to our ups ibt pension plan 
the remaining contributions in the through period were largely due to contributions to our international pension plans and us postretirement medical benefit plans 
as discussed further in the contractual commitments section  we have minimum funding requirements in the next several years  primarily related to the ups ibt pension  ups retirement and ups pension plans 

table of contents investing activities our primary sources uses of cash for investing activities were as follows amounts in millions net cash used in investing activities capital expenditures buildings and facilities aircraft and parts vehicles information technology capital expenditures as a of revenue other investing activities proceeds from disposals of property  plant and equipment net decrease in finance receivables net purchases sales of marketable securities cash received paid for business acquisitions and dispositions other investing activities we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft  vehicles  equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth 
we generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations 
capital spending increased in to support several growth initiatives 
in and  we had reduced capital spending to a level commensurate with our operating needs in the economic environment at that time 
future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors  including economic and industry conditions 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for will be approximately billion  or approximately of revenue 
capital spending on aircraft over the to period was largely due to scheduled deliveries of previous orders for the boeing and aircraft 
capital spending on vehicles increased during and in our us and international package businesses and our freight unit  due to vehicle replacements  technology enhancements and new vehicle orders to support volume growth 
capital expenditures on buildings and facilities declined over the through period  primarily resulting from the completion of several large hub construction and expansion projects  including our worldport hub expansion 
in  we completed the first phase of our worldport expansion  which increased the sorting capacity by 
the final phase of the worldport expansion was completed in  with an additional sorting capacity of approximately 
we anticipate that capital spending on buildings and facilities will increase in  due to expansion and new construction projects at facilities in europe and asia  including a million expansion at our european air hub in cologne  germany during and the increase in proceeds from the disposal of property  plant and equipment is largely due to real estate sales and the proceeds from insurance recoveries 
the net decline in finance receivables in the through period is primarily due to customer paydowns and loan sales activity  primarily in our commercial lending  asset based lending and leasing portfolios 
the purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types  and will therefore fluctuate from period to period 
the cash paid for business acquisitions in was largely due to the acquisition of pieffe group in italy 
the cash received from business dispositions in was largely due to the sale of ups logistics technologies  inc in  the cash outflow for the purchase of unsped paket servisi san ve ticaret as was largely offset by the cash received from the sale of the international franchise operations of our mail boxes etc 
unit 

table of contents other investing activities include the cash settlement of derivative contracts used in our currency hedging programs  the timing of aircraft purchase contract deposits on our boeing and boeing aircraft orders  and the equity investments in five new leveraged aircraft leases 
we received paid cash related to purchases and settlements of energy and currency derivative contracts used in our hedging programs of  and million during  and  respectively 
financing activities our primary sources uses of cash for financing activities are as follows amounts in millions  except per share data net cash used in financing activities share repurchases cash expended for shares repurchased number of shares repurchased shares outstanding at year end percent reduction in shares outstanding dividends dividends declared per share cash expended for dividend payments borrowings net borrowings repayments of debt principal other financing activities cash received for common stock issuances other financing activities capitalization total debt outstanding at year end total shareowners equity at year end total capitalization debt to total capitalization in january  the board of directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to billion 
share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases  open market purchases  or other such methods as we deem appropriate 
the timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions 
as a result of the uncertain economic environment in and  we slowed our share repurchase activity  and repurchased shares at a rate that approximately offset the dilution from our stock compensation programs 
unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our board  the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program 
as of december   we had billion of our share repurchase authorization remaining 
in  pending board of directors approval of an additional share repurchase authorization  we anticipate repurchasing approximately billion in shares 
the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors  including our net income  financial condition  cash requirements  future prospects  and other relevant factors 
we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends 
in february  we increased our quarterly dividend payment from to per share  a increase 
issuances of debt in consisted primarily of commercial paper and five new aircraft leases 
in and  we completed senior fixed rate note offerings of billion in each year 
these note offerings were used for various purposes  including discretionary contributions to ups sponsored pension plans  the retirement of existing debt instruments and other general corporate purposes 

table of contents repayments of debt in  and consisted primarily of paydowns of commercial paper  early redemptions of our ups notes program and certain facilities bonds  and scheduled principal payments on our capitalized lease obligations 
we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non scheduled repayments of debt 
we had no commercial paper outstanding at december  and million outstanding at december  the amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout each year based on daily liquidity needs 
the average commercial paper balance was million and the average interest rate paid was in million and in  respectively 
cash received from common stock issuances to employees increased primarily due to additional stock option exercises in and the cash outflows in other financing activities are largely due to repurchases of shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations  as well as certain hedging activities on forecasted debt issuances and premiums paid on capped call options for the purchase of ups class b shares 
in conjunction with the senior fixed rate debt offerings in and  we settled several interest rate derivatives that were designated as hedges of these debt offerings  which resulted in cash inflows outflows of and million  respectively 
as of december   we had paid premiums of million on capped call options for the purchase of million class b shares that will settle in the first half of sources of credit we are authorized to borrow up to billion under our us commercial paper program 
as of december   we had no commercial paper outstanding 
the amount of commercial paper outstanding in is expected to fluctuate 
we also maintain a european commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to billion in a variety of currencies  however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of december  we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks 
one of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of billion  and expires on april  generally  amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to libor for the applicable interest period and currency denomination  plus an applicable margin 
alternatively  a fluctuating rate of interest equal to citibank s publicly announced base rate  plus an applicable margin  may be used at our discretion 
in each case  the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on libor is a percentage determined by quotations from markit group ltd 
for our year credit default swap spread  subject to a minimum rate of and a maximum rate of 
the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on the base rate is below the applicable margin for libor advances but not lower than 
we are also able to request advances under this facility based on competitive bids for the applicable interest rate 
there were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of december  the second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of billion  and expires on april  generally  amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to libor for the applicable interest period and currency denomination  plus an applicable margin 
alternatively  a fluctuating rate of interest equal to citibank s publicly announced base rate  plus an applicable margin  may be used at our discretion 
in each case  the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on libor is a percentage determined by quotations from markit group ltd 
for our credit default swap spread  interpolated for a period from the date of determination of such credit default swap spread in connection with a new interest period until the latest maturity date of this facility then in effect but not less than a period of one year 
the applicable margin is subject to certain minimum rates and maximum rates based on our public debt ratings from standard poor s rating service and moody s investors service 
the minimum applicable margin rates range from to  and the maximum applicable margin rates range from to 
the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on the base rate is below the applicable margin for libor advances but not less than 
we are also able to request advances under this facility based on competitive bids 
there were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of december  
table of contents our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross default or ratings triggers  however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants 
as of december  and for all prior periods presented  we have satisfied these financial covenants 
these covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that we may incur  and limit the amount of attributable debt in sale leaseback transactions  to of net tangible assets 
as of december   of net tangible assets is equivalent to billion  however we have no covered sale leaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding 
additionally  we are required to maintain a minimum net worth  as defined  of billion on a quarterly basis 
as of december   our net worth  as defined  was equivalent to billion 
we do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 
guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off balance sheet financing arrangements  including variable interest entities  which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity 
contractual commitments we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases  operating leases  debt obligations  purchase commitments  and certain other liabilities 
we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations 
the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in millions commitment type after total capital leases operating leases debt principal debt interest purchase commitments pension fundings other liabilities total our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft 
capital leases  operating leases  and purchase commitments  as well as our debt principal obligations  are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed rate debt  in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december  the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements 
for debt denominated in a foreign currency  the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 
purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding  the largest of which are orders for aircraft  engines  and parts 
as of december   we have firm commitments to purchase boeing er freighters to be delivered between and these aircraft purchase orders will provide for anticipated future growth 
pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to our qualified pension plans 
these contributions include those to the ups ibt pension plan  the ups pension plan and the ups retirement plan 
these plans are discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the pension protection act of and the employee retirement income security act of  using discount rates  asset returns and other assumptions appropriate for these plans 
to the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our 
table of contents current projections  the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above 
additionally  we have not included minimum funding requirements beyond  because these projected contributions are not reasonably determinable 
we are not subject to any minimum funding requirement for cash contributions in in the ups retirement plan or ups pension plan 
the amount of any minimum funding requirement  as applicable  for these plans could change significantly in future periods  depending on many factors  including future plan asset returns and discount rates 
a sustained significant decline in the world equity markets  and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns  could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements 
such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and cash flows in future periods 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate 
contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process 
as we are not subject to any minimum contribution levels  we have not included any amounts in the contractual commitments table with respect to these multiemployer plans 
the contractual payments due for other liabilities primarily include commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships 
the table above does not include approximately million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash 
in addition  we also have recognized assets associated with uncertain tax positions in excess of the related liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities 
uncertain tax positions are further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately billion issued in connection with routine business requirements 
we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances  and as of december   we had million of surety bonds written 
as of december   we had unfunded loan commitments totaling million associated with our financial business 
we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business  including anticipated capital expenditures  for the foreseeable future 
contingencies we are involved in a number of judicial proceedings and other matters arising from the conduct of our business activities 
although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome  we have generally denied  or believe we have a meritorious defense and will deny  liability in all litigation pending against us  including the matters described below  and we intend to defend vigorously each case 
we have accrued for legal claims when  and to the extent that  amounts associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those claims 
for those matters as to which we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss  we are not able to determine whether the loss will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations or liquidity 
for matters in this category  we have indicated in the descriptions that follow the reasons that we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss 
judicial proceedings we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class action allegations under state wage and hour laws 
at this time  we do not believe that any loss associated with these matters  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
ups and our subsidiary mail boxes etc  inc are defendants in two lawsuits about the rebranding or purchase of the ups store franchises morgate and samica 
we prevailed at the trial court level in both cases

morgate was filed in march the plaintiffs are individual franchisees who did not rebrand and a certified class of all franchisees who did rebrand to the ups store 
a bellwether trial for three individual plaintiffs was set for early  but the trial court entered judgment against one of the three plaintiffs prior to trial  which was affirmed in january the trial court also granted our motion for summary judgment against the members of the certified class  which was reversed in january the remainder of the case has been stayed pending appeal 
samica was filed in march the plaintiffs are individual the ups store franchisees who either elected to rebrand or purchased new the ups store franchises 
summary judgment was granted in ups s favor and affirmed on appeal in december there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that may result from these matters including three separate components of these cases are being appealed to federal and state courts following decisions favorable to ups and we cannot predict the final outcomes of these appeals  and it remains uncertain what evidence of damages  if any  plaintiffs will be able to present if any aspects of these cases proceed forward 
accordingly  at this time  we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in barber auto sales v 
ups  which a federal court in alabama certified as a class action in september  the plaintiff asserts a breach of contract claim arising from ups s assessment of shipping charge corrections when ups determines that the dimensional weight of packages is greater than that reported by the shipper

ups and fedex corporation  a lawsuit filed in federal court in the central district of california in august  the plaintiff asserts that ups and fedex violated us antitrust law by conspiring to refuse to negotiate with third party negotiators retained by shippers and or to monopolize a so called market for shipping consultation services 
the antitrust division of the us department of justice doj has informed us that it has opened a civil investigation of our policies and practices for dealing with third party negotiators 
we are cooperating with this investigation 
we deny any liability with respect to these matters and intend to vigorously defend ourselves 
there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that may result from these matters including we believe that we have a number of meritorious defenses  afms has not articulated any measure of damages  and the doj investigation is ongoing 
accordingly  at this time  we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in canada  three purported class action cases were filed against us in british columbia  ontario and qu bec 
the cases each allege inadequate disclosure concerning the existence and cost of brokerage services provided by us under applicable provincial consumer protection legislation and infringement of interest restriction provisions under the criminal code of canada 
the british columbia class action was declared inappropriate for certification and dismissed by the trial judge 
that decision was upheld by the british columbia court of appeal in march  which ended the case in our favor 
the ontario class action was certified in september partial summary judgment was granted to us and the plaintiffs by the ontario motions court 
the complaint under the criminal code was dismissed 
no appeal is being taken from that decision 
the allegations of inadequate disclosure were granted and we are appealing that decision 
the request to certify the case in qu bec will be heard in february we have denied all liability and are vigorously defending the two outstanding cases 
there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that may result from these matters  including we are vigorously defending ourselves and believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses and there are unresolved questions of law and fact that could be important to the ultimate resolution of these matters

we received a grand jury subpoena from the antitrust division of the doj regarding the doj s investigation into certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry in december in october  june and february  we received information requests from the european commission commission relating to its investigation of certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry  and subsequently responded to each request 
in february  ups received a statement of objections by the commission 
this document contains the commission s preliminary view with respect to alleged anticompetitive behavior in the freight forwarding industry by freight forwarders  including ups 
although it alleges anticompetitive behavior  it does not prejudge the commission s final decision  as to facts or law which is subject to appeal to the european courts 
the options available to the commission include taking no action or imposing a monetary fine  the range of any potential action by the commission is not reasonably estimable 
any decision imposing a fine would be subject to appeal 
ups has responded to the statement of objections  including at a july commission hearing  and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in this proceeding 
we received additional information requests from the commission in january and july  and we have responded to those requests 
in august  competition authorities in brazil opened an administrative proceeding to investigate alleged anticompetitive behavior in the freight forwarding industry 
approximately freight forwarding companies and individuals are named in the proceeding  including ups  ups scs transportes brasil sa  and a former employee in brazil 
ups will have an opportunity to respond to these allegations 
we are cooperating with each of these investigations  and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves 
there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that may result from these matters including we are vigorously defending each matter and believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses  there are unresolved questions of law that could be of importance to the ultimate resolutions of these matters  including the calculation of any potential fine  and there is uncertainty about the time period that is the subject of the investigations 
accordingly  at this time  we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in january  a class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york alleging price fixing activities relating to the provision of freight forwarding services 
ups was not named in this case 
in july  the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint naming numerous global freight forwarders as defendants 
ups and ups supply chain solutions are among the defendants named in the amended complaint 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case 
there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that may result from these matters including the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant our motion to dismiss  with leave to amend  and the scope of the plaintiffs claims is therefore unclear  the scope and size of the proposed class is 
table of contents ill defined  there are significant legal questions about the adequacy and standing of the putative class representatives  and we believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses

we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business 
we do not believe that the eventual resolution of these other lawsuits either individually or in the aggregate  including any reasonably possible losses in excess of current accruals  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in june  we received internal revenue service irs reports covering income taxes and excise taxes for tax years through and through  respectively 
the reports propose assessments related to amounts paid for software  research credit expenditures and deductibility of financing and post acquisition integration costs as well as taxes on amounts paid for air transportation 
receipt of the reports represents only the conclusion of the examination process 
we disagree with the proposed assessments related to these matters 
therefore  we have filed protests and protective tax refund claims 
during the third quarter of  the irs responded to our protests and forwarded the cases to irs appeals 
there are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that may result from these matters including we are vigorously defending these matters and believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses  we have filed refund claims in excess of the proposed assessments  there are unresolved questions of law and fact that could be of importance to the ultimate resolutions of these matters  including the calculation of any additional taxes and or tax refunds  and these matters are at the initial stage of a multi level administrative appeals process that may ultimately be resolved by litigation 
accordingly  at this time  we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
collective bargaining agreements as of december   we had approximately  employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters

new accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update regarding disclosure of an employer s participation in multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans 
this new guidance requires companies to provide additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures about financial obligations  risks and commitments  as well as the level of participation in multiemployer plans 
companies are required to disclose detailed information about significant multiemployer plans  including contributions made to the plans  financial health and funded status of the plans  and expiration of the collective bargaining agreements that require contributions to the plans 
this accounting standards update impacted our disclosures only  and did not have any impact on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
the disclosures required by this accounting standards update are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued an accounting standards update that amends the accounting guidance on goodwill impairment testing 
this accounting standards update is intended to reduce complexity and costs by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit 
this accounting standards update also amends existing guidance by expanding upon the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider between annual impairment tests in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
we adopted this accounting standards update and applied its provisions to certain of our reporting units for our annual goodwill impairment testing as of october  other accounting pronouncements adopted during the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements had an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
accounting standards issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements issued  but not effective until after december   are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in note to our consolidated financial statements  the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates  which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts  we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
contingencies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we record a liability based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 

table of contents the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable 
at the time a contingency is identified  we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation 
we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable 
events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability 
these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
contingent losses that are probable and estimable  excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below  were not material to our financial position as of december  in addition  we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december   because a loss is not reasonably estimable 
goodwill and intangible impairment we perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis 
our reporting units are comprised of the europe  asia  and americas reporting units in the international package reporting segment  and the forwarding  logistics  ups freight  mbe the ups store and ups capital reporting units in the supply chain freight reporting segment 
our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october st for each reporting unit 
in assessing goodwill for impairment  we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit  then we utilize a two step process to test goodwill for impairment 
first  a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value  including goodwill  is performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model dcf model  and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies  as applicable 
the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows 
these assumptions include projections of future revenue  costs and working capital changes 
in addition  we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables  as required  in estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 
the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions  and changes in our business strategy  government regulations or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments 
we will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods 
if impairment indicators are present in future periods  the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 
none of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in  or changes in our forecasts could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods  potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge 
as of our october  goodwill impairment testing date  our ups freight reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
the fair value of this reporting unit was negatively impacted in by the difficult market environment for the ltl industry  resulting in reduced equity valuations for market comparable companies 
several factors  including lower than expected revenues and or operating margins  an increased cost of capital and higher than anticipated capital expenditure requirements  could result in the reporting unit s fair value declining below its carrying value in a future period 
additionally  a sustained decline in the valuations of publicly traded comparable companies in the ltl industry would also reduce the calculated fair value of this reporting unit 
our ups freight reporting unit has a total goodwill balance of million as of december  a decrease in the estimated fair value of our other reporting units as of our most recent goodwill testing date october  would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 

table of contents licenses with a carrying value of million as of december  are deemed to be indefinite lived intangibles  and therefore are not amortized 
impairment tests for indefinite lived intangibles are performed on an annual basis 
all of our remaining recorded intangible assets are deemed to be finite lived intangibles  and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives 
impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible 
if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable  a write down to fair value is recorded 
fair values are determined based on a dcf model 
no impairments of indefinite lived or finite lived intangible assets were recognized in  or self insurance accruals we self insure costs associated with workers compensation claims  automotive liability  health and welfare and general business liabilities  up to certain limits 
insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
recorded balances are based on reserve levels  which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves 
we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 
workers compensation  automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle 
consequently  actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims 
a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim  including the length of time the claim remains open  trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation 
furthermore  claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections 
changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accruals 
all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees 
these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans  anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation 
actual results may differ from these estimates and  therefore  produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
fair value measurements in the normal course of business  we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk  including derivatives  marketable securities  finance receivables  other investments and debt 
certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value  principally derivatives  marketable securities  pension assets and certain other investments 
fair values are based on listed market prices  when such prices are available 
to the extent that listed market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors  including dealer price quotations 
certain financial instruments  including over the counter derivative instruments  are valued using pricing models that consider  among other factors  contractual and market prices  correlations  time value  credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors 
changes in the fixed income  equity  foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting our results of operations 
a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity prices is presented in the market risk section of this report 

table of contents pension and postretirement medical benefits our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  compensation increase rates  expected returns on plan assets  mortality rates and other factors 
the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates  and we believe that they are reasonable  based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we elected to change our accounting methodologies for recognizing expense for our company sponsored us and international pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
previously  net actuarial gains or losses in excess of of the greater of the market related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligations the corridor were recognized over the average remaining service life of employees in each respective plan 
further  for our largest pension plan the ups retirement plan  we used a calculated value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five year period 
under our new accounting methods  we will recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor annually in the fourth quarter each year 
these new accounting methods result in changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses being recognized in expense faster than our previous amortization method 
the remaining components of pension expense  primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets  will be recorded on a quarterly basis as ongoing pension expense herein referred to as ongoing expense or ongoing net periodic benefit cost 
the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a basis point change in the assumed discount rate  expected return on assets  and health care cost trend rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plans  and the resulting increase decrease on our obligations and ongoing expense as of  and for the year ended  december  in millions 
basis point increase basis point decrease pension plans discount rate effect on ongoing net periodic benefit cost effect on projected benefit obligation return on assets effect on ongoing net periodic benefit cost postretirement medical plans discount rate effect on ongoing net periodic benefit cost effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation health care cost trend rate effect on ongoing net periodic benefit cost effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
table of contents ongoing expense will increase in compared with  due primarily to the decline in the us discount rate used to determine expense from for to for this is partially offset by the contributions to the plans in that increased the expected return on assets used for expense calculation purposes 
depreciation  residual value and impairment of fixed assets as of december   we had billion of net fixed assets  the most significant category of which is aircraft 
in accounting for fixed assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 
in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft  we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types 
subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program  changes in the utilization of the aircraft  governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions  and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary 
adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 
we review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable  a write down to fair value is recorded 
fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows or external appraisals  as applicable 
we review long lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified 
the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
in estimating cash flows  we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business 
adverse changes in these volume forecasts  or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections  could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand 
this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type  resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 
in and  there were no indicators of impairment in our aircraft fleet  and no impairment charges were recorded in either period 
in  we recorded a million impairment charge  as described in the following paragraphs 
in  we had announced that we were in negotiations with dhl to provide air transportation services for all of dhl s express  deferred and international package volume within the united states  as well as air transportation services between the united states  canada and mexico 
in early april  ups and dhl mutually agreed to terminate further discussions on providing these services 
additionally  our us domestic package air delivery volume had declined for several quarters as a result of persistent economic weakness and shifts in product mix from our premium air services to our lower cost ground services 
as a result of these factors  the utilization of certain aircraft fleet types had declined and was expected to be lower in the future 
based on the factors noted above  as well as faa aging aircraft directives that would require significant future maintenance expenditures  we determined that a triggering event had occurred that required an impairment assessment of our mcdonnell douglas dc and dc aircraft fleets 
we conducted an impairment analysis as of march   and determined that the carrying amount of these fleets was not recoverable due to the accelerated expected retirement dates of the aircraft 
based on anticipated residual values for the airframes  engines  and parts  we recognized an impairment charge of million in the first quarter of the dc fleets were subsequently retired from service 

table of contents income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction  tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold  the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
allowance for doubtful accounts losses on accounts receivable are recognized when they are incurred  which requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date 
these estimates require consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions  trends in customer payment frequency  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors 
our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations of risk 
deterioration in macroeconomic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and was and million  respectively 
our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended december   and was  and million  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity prices 
all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business  as we do not engage in speculative trading activities 
in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures  we utilize a variety of commodity  foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts  options and swaps 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels  principally jet a  diesel and unleaded gasoline 
currently  the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes 
additionally  we periodically use a combination of option contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices 
as of december  and  however  we had no commodity option contracts outstanding 
foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue  operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate 
we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities and cash flows 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar 
we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures 
these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of to months 
additionally  we utilize cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency risk inherent in the interest and principal payments associated with foreign currency denominated debt obligations 
the terms of these swap agreements are commensurate with the underlying debt obligations 
interest rate risk we have issued debt instruments  including debt associated with capital leases  that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest 
we use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
the notional amount  interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt 
we also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances 
our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short term primarily libor interest rates 
we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations  as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans  which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 
we have investments in debt securities  as well as cash equivalent instruments  some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest 
additionally  we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 
equity price risk we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk 
these securities are primarily in the form of equity index funds 
sensitivity analysis the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk  interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates  interest rate yield curves and 
table of contents commodity and equity prices 
for options and instruments with non linear returns  models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios  these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts 
we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 
additionally  changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 
shock test result as of december  in millions change in fair value currency derivatives change in annual expense variable rate debt interest rate derivatives the potential change in fair value from a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar against local currency exchange rates across all maturities 
the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates  applied to our variable rate debt and swap instruments excluding hedges of anticipated debt issuances 
the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in critical accounting policies and estimates 
the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our marketable securities due to changes in equity prices and interest rates  respectively  was not material as of december  or the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was also not material as of december  or
