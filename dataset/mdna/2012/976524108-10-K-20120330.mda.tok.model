critical accounting policies estimates and assumptions management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of the company s critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that the company believes are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and assumptions are made by management to assess the overall likelihood that an accounting estimate or assumption may require adjustment 
management assumptions have been reasonably accurate in the past  and future estimates or assumptions are likely to be calculated on the same basis 
stock based compensation the company follows the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  share based payment 
the fair value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
for the performance based options granted in  the company took into consideration guidance under asc and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab when reviewing and updating assumptions 
no performance based options were granted in the expected option life is derived from assumed exercise rates based upon historical exercise patterns and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected volatility is based upon historical volatility of our shares using weekly price observations over an observation period that approximates the expected life of the options 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve rate in effect at the time of grant for periods similar to the expected option life 
the estimated forfeiture rate included in the option valuation was zero 
management estimates are necessary in determining compensation expense for stock options with performance based vesting criteria 
compensation expense for this type of stock based award is recognized over the period from the date the performance conditions are determined to be probable of occurring through the date the applicable conditions are expected to be met 
if the performance conditions are not considered probable of being achieved  no expense is recognized until such time as the performance conditions are considered probable of being met  if ever 
management evaluates whether performance conditions are probable of occurring on a quarterly basis 
revenue recognition revenue from product shipments  including shipping and handling fees  is recognized once delivery has occurred provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
sales to international distributors are recognized in the same manner 
if title does not pass until the product reaches the customer s delivery site  then revenue recognition is deferred until that time 
there are no formal sales incentives offered to any of the company s customers 
volume discounts may be offered from time to time to customers purchasing large quantities on a per transaction basis 
there are no special post shipment obligations or acceptance provisions that exist with any sales arrangements 
inventories raw material inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
finished goods and work in process are valued at average cost of production  which includes material  labor and manufacturing expenses 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a key consideration in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts has been  and will continue to be  our customer s payment history and aging of its accounts receivable balance 
income taxes the company records deferred taxes in accordance with asc  accounting for income taxes 
this asc requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements  based upon the enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the company establishes a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the company periodically assesses the value of its deferred tax asset  a majority of which has been generated by the disposition of willtek  and determines the necessity for a valuation allowance 
the company evaluates which portion  if any  will more likely than not be realized by offsetting future taxable income  taking into consideration any limitations that may exist on its use of its net operating loss carryforwards 
uncertain tax position under asc  the company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements attributable to such position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate resolution of the position 
the company has analyzed its filing positions in all of the federal  state and foreign jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns 
as of december  and  the company has identified its federal tax return  its state tax return in new jersey and its foreign return in germany as major tax jurisdictions  as defined  in which it is required to file income tax returns 
based on the evaluations noted above  the company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition or disclosure in its consolidated financial statements 
based on a review of tax positions for all open years and contingencies as set out in the company s notes to the consolidated financial statements  no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to asc during the years ended december  and  and the company does not anticipate that it is reasonably possible that any material increase or decrease in its unrecognized tax benefits will occur within twelve months 
valuation of goodwill the company reviews the goodwill of its subsidiary  microlab  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also reviews microlab s goodwill annually in accordance with asc  accounting for business combinations  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is ongoing  subjective and requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future cash flows and forecasts 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over fair value of net assets acquired 
testing for the impairment of goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test requires the comparing of a reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value is less than the fair value  no impairment exists and the second step is not performed 
if the carrying value is higher than the fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by estimating the fair values of all recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit and comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that unit s goodwill 
as noted above  goodwill is attributable to one of the company s reporting units  microlab 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that management expects to hold for sale is based on the fair value of the assets 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell

if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount  the two step impairment test would be required 
otherwise  further testing would not be needed 
asu will be effective for fiscal and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
this update eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requires all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements
