we conduct a significant portion of our operations in foreign countries 
approximately and of our consolidated service revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively  were from non us operations 
because our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on our operating results 
for the fiscal year  approximately of total consolidated service revenue was from euro denominated contracts and approximately of total consolidated service revenue was from pounds sterling denominated contracts 
for the fiscal year  approximately of total consolidated service revenue was from euro denominated contracts and approximately of total consolidated service revenue was from pounds sterling denominated contracts 
approximately of our contracts are fixed price  with some variable components  and range in duration from a few months to several years 
cash flows from these contracts typically consist of a down payment required at the time of contract execution with the balance due in installments over the contract s duration  usually on a milestone achievement basis 
revenue from these contracts is recognized generally as work is performed 
as a result  the timing of client billing and cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred and revenue recognized on contracts 
generally  our clients can either terminate their contracts with us upon thirty to sixty days notice or delay execution of services 
clients may terminate or delay contracts for a variety of reasons  including merger or potential merger related activities involving the client  the failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria  unexpected or undesired clinical results of the product  client cost reductions as a result of budgetary limits or changing priorities  the client s decision to forego a particular study  insufficient patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  or clinical drug manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of the product 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regard an accounting estimate underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate if the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved  or the susceptibility of such matter to change  and if the impact of the estimate or assumption on financial condition or operating performance is material 
we believe that the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results revenue recognition we derive revenue from the delivery of service or software solutions to clients in the worldwide pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and medical device industries 
in general  we recognize revenue as services are performed when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service offering has been delivered to the client  the collection of fees is probable  and the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable 
our client arrangements in crs generally involve multiple service deliverables  where bundled service deliverables are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  multiple element arrangements 
we determined that each of our service deliverables has standalone value and base the selling price upon third party evidence tpe 
tpe is established for each of our arrangement deliverables based on the price we charge for equivalent services when sold to other similar customers as well as our knowledge of market pricing from the competitive bidding process for customer contracts offering similar services to comparably situated customers 
within perceptive s clinphone rtsm business  we offer selected software solutions through a hosted application delivered through a standard web browser 
we recognize revenue from application hosting services in accordance with asc  revenue recognition in the software industry and asc as our customers do not have the right to take possession of the software 
revenue resulting from these hosting services consists of three stages set up client specification and workflow  hosting and support services  and closeout reporting 
critical management estimates may be involved in the determination of hosting period  and other revenue elements 
changes to these elements could affect the amount and timing of revenue recognition 
billed and unbilled accounts receivable billed accounts receivable represent amounts for which invoices have been sent to clients based upon contract terms 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been sent to clients 
we maintain a provision for losses on receivables based on historical collectability and specific identification of potential problem accounts 
critical management estimates may be involved in the determination of collectability and the amounts required to be recorded as provisions for losses on receivables 
income taxes our global provision for corporate income taxes is determined in accordance with asc  income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that future tax benefits from the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before tax among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate  adjusted as required by the tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction 
changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of asc  which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions  as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances 
in addition  asc requires financial statement disclosure about uncertainty in income tax reporting positions 
we are subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities that may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is based on judgment 
we believe we have adequately provided for any uncertain tax positions 
however  future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition and is subject to annual impairment testing or more frequent testing if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying value 
our impairment testing for goodwill involves assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill 
this assessment requires management judgment on the potential impact of each qualitative factor 
our impairment testing for our indefinite lived intangible  the clinphone tradename  requires management judgment and the use of estimates in our royalty relief methodology used in estimating fair value 
these estimates include future growth rates and discount factors 
based on our fiscal year qualitative assessment of impairment for goodwill and our quantitative royalty relief fair value assessment for our tradename  we concluded that neither were impaired 
results of operations note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k provides a summary of our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the years ended june  and analysis by segment we evaluate our segment performance and allocate resources based on service revenue and gross profit service revenue less direct costs  while other operating costs are allocated and evaluated on a geographic basis 
accordingly  we do not include the impact of selling  general  and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  interest income expense  other income loss  and income tax expense benefit in segment profitability 
we attribute revenue to individual countries based upon the cost of services performed in the respective countries and inter segment transactions are not included in service revenue 
furthermore  we have a global infrastructure supporting our business segments and therefore  assets are not identified by reportable segment

on a segment basis  crs service revenue increased by million  or  to  million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase was attributable to a million improvement in our phase ii iii pace business  partly offset by a million decrease in early phase including a million decrease due to the disposition of two south african facilities 
the increase in phase ii iii pace was due to our success in winning new business awards and the continued positive impact of strategic partnerships

pcms service revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase was due primarily to a million increase in consulting services associated with growth in start up phase ii iii activities and growth in strategic compliance work

perceptive service revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the growth was due primarily to a million increase in clinphone rtsm services  a million increase in medical imaging  and million in other eclinical services

this decrease in operating margin was due primarily to the increases in direct costs described above 
other expense  net we recorded net other expense of million for fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year the million decrease was due primarily to a million decrease in interest expense and a million decrease in miscellaneous expense 
miscellaneous expense for fiscal year of million was primarily attributable to million of unrealized losses related to derivatives contracts and million of losses from asset disposals and loan write offs  partly offset by million in foreign exchange gains from certain foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
miscellaneous expense for fiscal year of million was primarily attributable to million of losses in foreign exchange from certain foreign denominated assets and liabilities and a million charge for the impairment of certain long lived assets  partly offset by million of unrealized gains related to derivatives contracts 
the higher than anticipated net loss was caused  in part  by short term disruptions associated with the implementation of our new project accounting and billing system which adversely impacted cash flow and delayed the settlement of certain intercompany transactions 
taxes for fiscal year and fiscal year  we had effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
the low tax rate for fiscal year was primarily the result of the release of income tax reserves and associated accruals for interest and penalties resulting from settlements with tax authorities and the expiration of statutes of limitations in europe 
the low tax rate for fiscal year was primarily attributable to reductions in valuation allowances resulting from profitability improvements in the united states and the united kingdom

the increases were due primarily to strong new business growth in crs  especially in the asia pacific region

in the past  we recognized revenue in respective regions based upon the work performed therein 
on a segment basis  crs service revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase was attributable to a million improvement in our phase ii iii pace business and million related to the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  partly offset by a decrease in early phase

however  it has taken longer for backlog related to strategic partnerships to convert into revenue than work awarded to us by traditional clients 
pcms service revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for the same period in the increase was due primarily to a million increase in strategic compliance related services due to increased regulatory challenges that our clients have encountered

taxes for fiscal year and fiscal year  we had effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
the decrease in tax rate is primarily attributable to the favorable impact of a change in the geographic distribution of earnings  a reduction in non deductible expenses outside of the united states  and a reduction in valuation reserves in the united kingdom and the united states 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations and growth with cash flow from operations  proceeds from the sale of equity securities  and credit facilities to fund business acquisitions and working capital 
investing activities primarily reflect capital expenditures for information systems enhancements and leasehold improvements 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  of which the majority is held in foreign countries since excess cash generated in the us is primarily used to repay our debt obligations 
foreign cash balances include unremitted foreign earnings  which are invested indefinitely outside of the us our cash and cash equivalents are held in deposit accounts and money market funds  which provide us with immediate and unlimited access to the funds 
repatriation of funds to the us from us entities may be subject to taxation or certain legal restrictions 
nevertheless  most of our cash resides in countries with few or no such restrictions 
days sales outstanding our operating cash flow is heavily influenced by changes in the levels of billed and unbilled receivables and deferred revenue 
these account balances as well as days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable  net of deferred revenue  can vary based on contractual milestones and the timing and size of cash receipts 
we calculate dso by adding the end of period balances for billed and unbilled account receivables  net of deferred revenue short term and long term and the provision for losses on receivables  then dividing the resulting amount by the sum of total revenue plus investigator fees billed for the most recent quarter  and multiplying the resulting fraction by the number of days in the quarter 
the following table presents the dso  account receivables balances  and deferred revenue as of june  and june  in millions june  june  billed accounts receivable  net unbilled accounts receivable  net total accounts receivable deferred revenue net receivables dso in days the decrease in dso for the quarter ended june  compared to the quarter ended june   was due primarily to improvements in billing and collections 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for fiscal year the million increase in operating cash flows primarily reflects the effects of improved customer billings and collections  increased client advances  and other changes to working capital requirements 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase of million was due primarily to capital expenditures for computer hardware and software and less proceeds from the sale of marketable securities 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal year as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal year the million decrease was due primarily to net repayments of debt in fiscal year compared to net borrowing in fiscal year  as a result of strong collections 
lines of credit credit agreement on june   we entered into an unsecured senior credit facility the credit agreement providing for a five year term loan of million and a revolving credit facility in the principal amount of up to million 
the borrowings all carry a variable interest rate based on libor  prime  or a similar index  plus a margin margin not to exceed a per annum rate of 
in september  we entered into an interest rate swap and an interest rate cap agreement 
these interest rate hedges were deemed to be fully effective in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging  and  as such  unrealized gains and losses related to these derivatives are recorded as other comprehensive income 
principal in the amount of million under the credit agreement has been hedged with an interest rate swap agreement and carries a fixed interest rate of plus an applicable margin 
principal in the amount of million has been hedged with an interest rate cap arrangement with an interest rate cap of plus an applicable margin 
as of june   we had million of principal borrowed under the revolving credit facility  million of principal borrowed under the term loan  and borrowing availability of million under the revolving credit facility 
our debt under the credit agreement  including the million of principal hedged with an interest swap agreement  carried an average annualized interest rate of during the twelve months ended june   we made principal payments of million on the term loan 
the remaining term loan scheduled repayments under the credit agreement increase over time million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year additional lines of credit we have an unsecured line of credit with jp morgan uk in the amount of million that bears interest at an annual rate ranging between and 
we entered into this line of credit to facilitate business transactions 
at june   we had million available under this line of credit 
we have a cash pool facility with rbs nederland  nv in the amount of million euros that bears interest at an annual rate ranging between and 
we entered into this line of credit to facilitate business transactions 
at june   we had million euros available under this line of credit 
we have a cash pooling arrangement with rbs nederland  nv 
pooling which occurs when debit balances are offset against credit balances and the overall net position is used as a basis by the bank for calculating the overall pool interest amount 
each legal entity owned by us and party to this arrangement remains the owner of either a credit deposit or a debit overdraft balance 
therefore  interest income is earned by legal entities with credit balances  while interest expense is charged to legal entities with debit balances 
based on the pool s aggregate balance  the bank then recalculates the overall interest to be charged or earned  compares this amount with the sum of previously charged earned interest amounts per account and additionally pays charges the difference 
the gross overdraft balance related to this pooling arrangement was million and million at june  and june   respectively  and was included in cash and cash equivalents 
financing needs our primary cash needs are for operating expenses  such as salaries and fringe benefits  hiring and recruiting  business development and facilities  business acquisitions  capital expenditures  and repayment of principal and interest on our borrowings 
our requirements for cash to pay principal and interest on our borrowings will increase significantly in future periods because we borrowed million in fiscal year under the credit agreement to refinance our prior debt facilities and to provide working capital 
our primary committed external source of funds is under the credit agreement  described above 
our principal source of cash is from the performance of services under contracts with our clients 
if we were unable to generate new contracts with existing and new clients or if the level of contract cancellations increased  our revenue and cash flow would be adversely affected see part i  item a risk factors for further detail 
absent a material adverse change in the level of our new business bookings or contract cancellations  we believe that our existing capital resources together with cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs over the next twelve months and on a longer term basis 
depending upon our revenue and cash flow from operations  it is possible that we will require external funds to repay amounts outstanding under our credit agreement upon maturity in we expect to continue to acquire businesses to enhance our service and product offerings  expand our therapeutic expertise  and or increase our global presence 
depending on their size  any future acquisitions may require additional external financing  and we may from time to time seek to obtain funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
we may be unable to secure such financing at all or on terms acceptable to us  as a result of our outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement 
in addition  under the terms of the credit agreement  interest rates are fixed based on market indices at the time of borrowing and  depending upon the interest mechanism selected by us  may float thereafter 
as a result  the amount of interest payable by us on our borrowings may increase if market interest rates change 
however  we expect to mitigate the risk of increasing market interest rates with our hedging programs described below 
we made capital expenditures of million during the fiscal year  primarily for computer software  hardware  and leasehold improvements 
we expect capital expenditures to total approximately million to million in fiscal year  primarily for computer software and hardware and leasehold improvements 
on august   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
there is no set expiration date for the program 
the timing and amount of repurchases will be determined by certain members of our management team based on a variety of factors such as trading price  corporate requirements  and overall market conditions  and will be subject to applicable legal requirements including federal and state securities laws 
purchases may be made in open market transactions effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices  in block trades  in accelerated share repurchase transactions  or in privately negotiated transactions 
shares may also be purchased pursuant to a trading plan meeting the requirements of rule b under the securities exchange act of  as amen ded  which would permit shares to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws 
we intend to use cash on hand  cash generated from operations  existing credit facilities  or other financing to fund the share repurchase program 
we had approximately million remaining under a previous stock repurchase program  which has now been canceled 
debt  contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and guarantees the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at june  in thousands less than year years years more than years total debt obligations principal operating leases purchase obligations total includes commitments to purchase software  hardware  and services 
the above table does not include approximately million of potential tax liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information 
we have letter of credit agreements with banks  totaling approximately million  guaranteeing performance under various operating leases and vendor agreements 
borrowings under the credit agreement are guaranteed by certain of our us subsidiaries 
we periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business 
we believe  after consultation with counsel  that no matters currently pending would  in the event of an adverse outcome  either individually or in the aggregate  have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial position  changes in financial position  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our investors 
restructuring plans in april  we adopted a plan to restructure our operations to reduce expenses  better align costs with current and future geographic sources of revenue  and improve operating efficiencies the restructuring plan 
during fiscal year  we recorded million in restructuring charges relating the the plan  including approximately million in employee separation benefits  million in costs related to the abandonment of certain property leases  and million in impairment charges related to exited facilities 
during fiscal year  we recorded million in restructuring charges related to the restructuring plan  including million in severance costs and million in facility related costs 
the total cost of the restructuring plan was approximately million and included the elimination of approximately managerial and staff positions and costs related to the abandonment of certain property leases 
in october  we adopted a plan to restructure our operations to reduce expenses  better align costs with current and future geographic sources of revenue  and improve operating efficiencies 
during fiscal year  we recorded million in restructuring charges related to this plan  including approximately million in employee separation benefits associated with the elimination of managerial and staff positions and million in costs related to the abandonment of certain property leases 
during fiscal year  we recorded million of provision adjustments  related primarily to employee severance costs 
we believe that all costs associated with this restructuring plan have been recorded as of june  for restructuring plans established prior to fiscal year  we recorded million of restructuring charges in fiscal year  primarily for a change in estimate for our ability to sub lease certain abandoned properties 
inflation we believe the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 which deferred the guidance requiring entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement where net income is presented and the statement where other comprehensive income is presented for both interim and annual financial statements 
asu reinstated the requirements for the presentation of reclassifications that were in place prior to the issuance of asu and did not change the effective date for asu we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and other relevant market rates or price changes 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to market risk resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes 
our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the costs and availability of appropriate financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we derived approximately of our consolidated service revenue for the twelve months ended june  from operations outside of the united states and of our consolidated service revenue for the twelve months ended june  from operations outside of the united states 
in addition  was denominated in euros and was denominated in pounds sterling for the twelve months ended june  while was denominated in euros and was denominated in pounds sterling for the twelve months ended june  we have no significant operations in any country in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary 
our financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the translation of financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
it is our policy to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
accordingly  we have instituted foreign currency hedging programs and an interest rate swap cap program 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information on our hedging programs and interest rate swap program 
as of june   the programs with derivatives designated as hedging instruments under asc were deemed effective and the notional values of the derivatives were approximately million  including interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements with a total notional value of million executed in connection with the borrowings under our credit agreement 
under certain circumstances  such as the occurrence of significant differences between actual cash receipts and forecasted cash receipts  the asc programs could be deemed ineffective 
in that event  the unrealized gains and losses related to these derivatives  which are currently reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  would be recognized in earnings 
as of june   the estimated amount that could be recognized in earnings was a loss of approximately million  net of tax 
as of june   the notional value of derivatives that were not designated as hedging instruments under asc was approximately million 
during the twelve months ended june  and june   we recorded foreign currency exchange losses of million and million  respectively 
we also have exposure to additional foreign exchange risk as it relates to assets and liabilities that are not part of the economic hedge or designated hedging programs  but quantification of this risk is difficult to assess at any given point in time 
our exposure to interest rate changes relates primarily to the amount of our short term and long term debt 
short term debt was million at june  and million at june  long term debt was million at june  and million million at june  based on average short term and long term debt for the twelve months ended june   an increase in the average interest rate of basis points would decrease our pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million on an annual basis
