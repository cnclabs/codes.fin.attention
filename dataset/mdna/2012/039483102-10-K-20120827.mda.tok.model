item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview this md a should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company is principally engaged in procuring  transporting  storing  processing  and merchandising agricultural commodities and products 
the company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities  connecting to markets in more than countries 
the company also processes corn  oilseeds  wheat and cocoa into products for food  animal feed  chemical and energy uses 
the company uses its global asset network  business acumen  and its relationships with suppliers and customers to efficiently connect the harvest to the home thereby generating returns for our shareholders  principally from margins earned on these activities 
the company s operations are organized  managed and classified into three reportable business segments oilseeds processing  corn processing  and agricultural services 
each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered 
the company s remaining operations are not reportable segments  as defined by the applicable accounting standard  and are classified as other 
during fiscal  the company reorganized and streamlined its business unit reporting structure and broadened management spans of control 
starting with this annual report on form k the oilseeds processing reportable segment includes cocoa processing operations while the agricultural services reportable segment includes wheat processing operations 
the corn processing reportable segment  which includes sweeteners and starches and bioproducts  remains unchanged 
the company s remaining operations  which primarily include its financial business units  will continue to be classified as other 
previously  cocoa and wheat processing operations were included in other 
also  during fiscal  the company discontinued the allocation of interest expense from corporate to the operating segments 
throughout this annual report on form k  prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current period segment presentation 
the oilseeds processing segment includes global activities related to the origination  merchandising  crushing  and further processing of oilseeds such as soybeans and soft seeds cottonseed  sunflower seed  canola  rapeseed  and flaxseed into vegetable oils and protein meals 
oilseeds products produced and marketed by the company include ingredients for the food  feed  energy  and industrial products industries 
crude vegetable oils produced by the segment s crushing activities are sold as is or are further processed by refining  blending  bleaching  and deodorizing into salad oils 
salad oils are sold as is or are further processed by hydrogenating and or interesterifying into margarine  shortening  and other food products 
partially refined oils are used to produce biodiesel or are sold to other manufacturers for use in chemicals  paints  and other industrial products 
oilseed protein meals are principally sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in commercial livestock and poultry feeds 
in europe and south america  the oilseeds processing segment includes origination and merchandising activities as adjuncts to its oilseeds processing assets 
these activities include a network of grain elevators  port facilities  and transportation assets used to buy  store  clean  and transport grains and oilseeds 
the oilseeds processing segment produces natural health and nutrition products and other specialty food and feed ingredients 
the oilseeds processing segment is a major supplier of peanuts and peanut derived ingredients to both the us and export markets 
in north america  cottonseed flour is produced and sold primarily to the pharmaceutical industry and cotton cellulose pulp is manufactured and sold to the chemical  paper  and filter markets 
in south america  the oilseeds processing segment operates fertilizer blending facilities 
the oilseeds processing segment also includes activities related to the procurement  transportation and processing of cocoa beans into cocoa liquor  cocoa butter  cocoa powder  chocolate  and various compounds in north america  south america  europe  asia  and africa for the food processing industry 
the oilseeds processing segment also includes the company s share of the results of its equity investment in wilmar and its share of results for its stratas foods llc and edible oils limited joint ventures 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s corn processing segment is engaged in corn wet milling and dry milling activities  with its asset base primarily located in the central part of the united states 
the corn processing segment converts corn into sweeteners and starches  and bioproducts 
its products include ingredients used in the food and beverage industry including sweeteners  starch  syrup  glucose  and dextrose 
dextrose and starch are used by the corn processing segment as feedstocks for its bioproducts operations 
by fermentation of dextrose  the corn processing segment produces alcohol  amino acids  and other specialty food and animal feed ingredients 
ethyl alcohol is produced by the company for industrial use as ethanol or as beverage grade 
ethanol  in gasoline  increases octane and is used as an extender and oxygenate 
bioproducts also include amino acids such as lysine and threonine that are vital compounds used in swine feeds to produce leaner animals and in poultry feeds to enhance the speed and efficiency of poultry production 
corn gluten feed and meal  as well as distillers grains  are produced for use as animal feed ingredients 
corn germ  a by product of the wet milling process  is further processed into vegetable oil and protein meal 
other corn processing products include citric and lactic acids  lactates  sorbitol  xanthan gum  and glycols which are used in various food and industrial products 
the corn processing segment includes the activities of a propylene and ethylene glycol facility and the company s brazilian sugarcane ethanol plant and related operations 
in fiscal  the company ended its commercial alliance with metabolix  inc as a result of this decision  telles llc  the sales and marketing commercial alliance created to commercialize mirel  a bio based plastic  will be dissolved and the production of mirel on behalf of telles llc has ended 
this segment also includes the company s share of the results of its equity investments in almidones mexicanos sa  eaststarch cv  and red star yeast company llc 
the agricultural services segment utilizes its extensive us grain elevator  global transportation network  and port operations to buy  store  clean  and transport agricultural commodities  such as oilseeds  corn  wheat  milo  oats  rice  and barley  and resells these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients and as raw materials for the agricultural processing industry 
agricultural services grain sourcing  handling  and transportation network provides reliable and efficient services to the company s customers and agricultural processing operations 
agricultural services transportation network capabilities include barge  ocean going vessel  truck  and rail freight services 
agricultural services segment also includes the activities related to the processing of wheat into wheat flour  the processing and distribution of formula feeds  animal health and nutrition products  and the procurement  processing  and distribution of edible beans 
the agricultural services segment includes the activities of alfred c 
toepfer international  an owned global merchant of agricultural commodities and processed products 
the agricultural services segment also includes the company s share of the results of its kalama export company joint venture and its equity investment in gruma sab de sab other includes the company s remaining operations  primarily its financial business units  related principally to futures commission merchant activities and captive insurance 
on september   the company sold a majority ownership interest of the bank 
the bank was deconsolidated from the company s consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of fiscal resulting in no material effect to adm s earnings 
the company accounts for its remaining ownership interest in the bank under the equity method 
corporate results principally include the impact of lifo related inventory adjustments  unallocated corporate expenses  and interest cost net of investment income 
prior to january   corporate results included the after tax elimination of income attributable to mandatorily redeemable interests in consolidated subsidiaries 
upon expiration of the put options related to these interests  the results were included in noncontrolling interest 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operating performance indicators the company s oilseeds processing and agricultural services operations are principally agricultural commodity based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity based agricultural raw materials 
therefore  changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both net sales and other operating income and cost of products sold 
thus  changes in margins and gross profit of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in net sales and other operating income amounts 
the company s corn processing operations and certain other food and animal feed processing operations also utilize agricultural commodities or products derived from agricultural commodities as raw materials 
in these operations  agricultural commodity market price changes can result in significant fluctuations in cost of products sold  and such price changes cannot necessarily be passed directly through to the selling price of the finished products 
the company has consolidated subsidiaries in over countries 
for the majority of the company s subsidiaries located outside the united states  the local currency is the functional currency 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods 
for the majority of the company s business activities in brazil  the functional currency is the us dollar  however  certain transactions  including taxes  occur in local currency and require conversion to the functional currency 
fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies  primarily the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  and brazilian real  as compared to the us dollar can result in corresponding fluctuations in the us dollar value of revenues and expenses reported by the company 
the company measures the performance of its business segments using key financial metrics such as segment operating profit  return on invested capital  and cost per metric ton 
the company s operating results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices  weather conditions  crop plantings  government programs and policies  changes in global demand  general global economic conditions  changes in standards of living  and global production of similar and competitive crops 
due to these unpredictable factors  the company does not provide forward looking information in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
compared to as an agricultural commodity based business  the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the company s operating results 
from a demand perspective  global protein meal consumption has continued to grow although at a slower rate 
excess industry crushing production capacity has pressured oilseeds margins  and the company has adjusted production rates regionally to balance supply with current market demand 
biodiesel markets supported global demand for refined and crude vegetable oils 
in the us  high biodiesel inventories associated with the december   expiration of blender s incentives dampened margins in the second half of the fiscal year 
us corn sweetener exports continue to support sales volumes and margins 
ethanol sales volumes were supported by favorable gasoline blending economics in the us however  excess industry production of ethanol  together with recently reduced us ethanol export demand  have negatively impacted ethanol margins 
from a supply perspective  crop supplies in certain key growing regions at the beginning of this fiscal year  including south america and the black sea region  were adequate  but a smaller than normal harvest in north america last fall resulted in low us carryover stocks for corn and soybeans 
because of the smaller than expected current year south american harvest  global supplies of corn and soybeans are more dependent on this year s north american harvest 
while plantings of corn increased this year in the us  the drought conditions late in the fiscal year have decreased expectations for the size of the current year harvest 
these factors  combined with concerns about the european debt situation and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties  contributed to volatile commodity market price movements during this fiscal year 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net earnings attributable to controlling interests decreased billion to billion 
segment operating profit declined billion to billion amid more challenging conditions generally affecting all reportable segments 
segment operating profit in fiscal included million of asset impairment charges and exit costs comprised of million to exit the company s clinton  ia  bioplastics plant and million to shut down its walhalla  nd  ethanol dry mill 
earnings before income taxes included a credit of million from the effect on lifo inventory valuation reserves  including the liquidation of lifo inventory layers  partially offset by increasing agricultural commodity prices  compared to charges of million in the prior year 
fiscal unallocated corporate expenses included million of charges related to the company s global workforce reduction program 
income taxes decreased billion due to lower earnings before income taxes and a lower effective income tax rate 
the company s effective income tax rate declined to compared to in the prior year primarily due to income tax benefits associated with foreign currency re measurement of non monetary assets partially offset by a geographic mix of earnings that shifted more to foreign jurisdictions 
analysis of statements of earnings net sales and other operating income by segment are as follows change in millions oilseeds processing crushing and origination refining  packaging  biodiesel  and other cocoa and other asia total oilseeds processing corn processing sweeteners and starches bioproducts total corn processing agricultural services merchandising and handling transportation milling and other total agricultural services other financial total other total item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net sales and other operating income increased billion due to higher average selling prices  primarily related to higher underlying commodity costs  and billion due to increased sales volumes  including sales volumes from acquisitions  partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of billion 
oilseeds processing sales increased to billion due principally to higher average selling prices of vegetable oils  merchandised commodities  protein meal  and biodiesel and increased sales volumes of biodiesel  protein meal  and peanuts  in part due to the acquisition of golden peanut in december corn processing sales increased to billion due principally to higher average selling prices of ethanol and sweeteners as well as higher sales volumes of sugar and ethanol 
agricultural services sales increased to billion  due to higher average selling prices of corn and wheat flour partially offset by lower sales volumes  in part due to lower export volumes from the us cost of products sold increased to billion due principally to higher costs of agricultural commodities and  to a lesser extent  increased sales volumes 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced current year cost of products sold by billion 
manufacturing expenses increased billion due to higher costs for maintenance  employee and benefit related expenses  energy  and chemicals 
these higher costs were primarily due to higher production volumes  acquisitions  and higher unit costs for fuels and certain chemicals 
partially offsetting these higher costs was lower depreciation expense  in part due to the company s change in estimated service lives for machinery and equipment during the second quarter of fiscal selling  general  and administrative expenses remained steady at billion 
loss provisions mainly due to an unfavorable arbitration award in the company s agricultural services operating segment were partially offset by lower overhead expenses 
asset impairment  exit  and restructuring costs of million were comprised of million in the corn processing segment related to the company s exit from its clinton  ia  bioplastics business and ethanol dry mill in walhalla  nd  million in corporate for the global workforce reduction  and million in corporate for investment writedown and other facility exit related costs 
interest expense decreased to million primarily due to lower long term debt balances  higher interest expense capitalized on construction projects in progress  and lower interest expense related to uncertain income tax positions 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased to million principally due to decreased equity earnings from the company s equity investee  gruma  which included a million gain in the prior year related to gruma s disposal of certain assets 
interest income declined to million primarily related to the sale and deconsolidation of the bank  effective september  other income net declined million to million due primarily to the absence of income recognized in the prior year period of million for the golden peanut gain and million for gains on interest rate swaps

crushing and origination operating profit decreased million to million primarily due to weaker results in european softseeds  lower results in north american softseeds  and lower north american positioning results 
partially offsetting these lower results  were higher grain origination results in south america driven by higher volumes and favorable positioning 
poor european softseeds results were driven by a small prior year rapeseed crop  positioning losses  and weaker demand for protein meal and oils 
north american softseed results declined primarily as a result of lower margins generated from a tight cottonseed supply 
refining  packaging  biodiesel  and other results declined million to million due primarily to declines in biodiesel margins in south america and europe and lower margins for specialty fats and oils in europe 
these declines were partially offset by improved north american protein specialties and natural health and nutrition results due to higher margins and volumes 
cocoa and other results declined million to million 
current year results in cocoa and other were reduced by million for net unrealized mark to market losses related to certain forward purchase and sales commitments accounted for as derivatives 
last year included million of net unrealized mark to market losses 
excluding these timing effects  cocoa results improved in the current year driven by improved press margins caused by strong cocoa powder demand 
the prior year included the million golden peanut gain which was partially offset this year by higher earnings in the company s peanut business in part due to the first full year of consolidated results for golden peanut being reported by the company in fiscal asia results remained steady at million  principally reflecting the company s share of its results from equity investee  wilmar 
corn processing operating results decreased million to million due principally to poor ethanol margins and million in asset impairment charges and exit costs 
excluding the asset impairment and exit costs related to the company s bioplastics business and walhalla  nd  ethanol dry grind facility  corn processing operating profit of million in the current year represents a decline of million compared to the prior year 
processed volumes were up percent while net corn costs increased compared to last year 
sweeteners and starches operating profit increased million to million  as higher average selling prices more than offset higher net corn costs 
bioproducts profit decreased million to a loss of million  including the million asset impairment and exit charges 
lower ethanol margins were caused by excess supply as previously offline production restarted while industry demand declined  in part due to slowing export demand 
prior year bioproducts results were enhanced by favorable corn ownership positions  which lowered net corn costs in that period 
bioproducts results in the prior year were negatively impacted by startup costs of million related to the company s new dry grind ethanol  bioplastic  and glycol plants 
agricultural services operating profits decreased million to million 
merchandising and handling earnings decreased primarily due to lower results from us operations 
lower sales volumes were principally the result of the relatively higher cost of us grains and oilseeds in the global market due to lower stocks caused by a smaller us harvest in this relatively weaker position led to reduced us grain exports 
in the prior year  merchandising and handling results were positively impacted by higher quantities of us grain exports by the company 
in addition  fiscal included million of increased loss provisions mainly due to an unfavorable arbitration award 
earnings from transportation were steady 
last year s operating results in milling and other operations included a million gain related to gruma s disposal of certain assets 
other financial operating profit decreased million to million mainly due to higher loss provisions at the company s captive insurance subsidiary related to property and crop risk reserves 
corporate expenses declined million to million this year 
the effects of a liquidation of lifo inventory layers partially offset by increasing commodity prices on lifo inventory valuations resulted in a credit of million in the current year compared to a charge of million in the prior year primarily due to higher prices 
corporate interest expense decreased million primarily due to lower interest expense on lower long term debt balances 
unallocated corporate costs include million of costs related to the global workforce reduction program 
excluding these costs  unallocated corporate costs declined million due primarily to lower administrative costs 
corporate other income increased due to higher investment income partially offset by million for investment writedown and facility exit related costs 
also  in the prior year the company recognized million of gains on interest rate swaps 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued compared to as an agricultural commodity based business  the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the company s operating results 
in  prices for certain agricultural commodities were higher in response to growing global demand and tighter crop supplies 
the projections of lower carryover stocks for certain key commodities  coupled with regional crop supply dislocations for certain commodities  also led to high commodity price volatility 
global demand for agricultural commodities grew in  resulting in increased sales volumes for most of the company s products 
the large north american harvest resulted in global merchandising  handling  and processing opportunities 
protein meal markets for commercial livestock producers in the us  particularly poultry producers  faced challenging conditions 
biodiesel markets in europe and south america  together with the extension of the us biodiesel blender s credit  helped support global demand for refined and crude vegetable oils 
sweeteners and starches demand remained strong in due primarily to us exports of sweeteners and improved demand for industrial starches 
ethanol sales volumes  including increased volumes as the company s new dry mills ramped up  were supported by favorable gasoline blending economics in the us and good export demand 
net earnings increased million to billion due principally to a million increase in segment operating profit partially offset by a negative impact from changing lifo inventory valuations and higher income taxes 
in  the company successfully managed through significant increases in market prices for most of its agricultural commodity raw materials  resulting in increased segment operating profit 
earnings before income taxes includes charges of million from the effect of increasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves  compared to credits of million in the prior year caused by decreasing agricultural commodity prices 
income taxes increased million due to a higher effective income tax rate and higher earnings before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate of for was the result of changes in the geographic mix of earnings and unfavorable specific tax items 
the fully diluted earnings per share calculation for was impacted by the completion of the company s debt remarketing related to the billion equity units 
while the approximately million new common shares related to the billion equity units were not issued until june   the if converted method of accounting for diluted earnings per share required diluted eps to be calculated as if the company issued the shares on january   and this assumption resulted in a dilutive impact of on earnings per share see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cost of products sold increased to billion due to higher costs of agricultural commodities  negative impacts resulting from changes in lifo inventory valuations  and higher manufacturing costs 
cost of products sold includes charges of million from the effect of increasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves  compared to credits of million in the prior year caused by decreasing agricultural commodity prices 
manufacturing expenses increased million due primarily to higher processed volumes  including the volumes of the company s new greenfield operations coming on line  and higher average unit costs for certain chemicals and fuels used in the company s processing and transportation operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company updated its estimates for service lives of certain of its machinery and equipment assets 
this change in estimate resulted in a million decrease in depreciation expense compared to the amount of depreciation expense the company would have recorded using the previously estimated service lives 
manufacturing expenses included million in fiscal related to the start up of new plants compared to million in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to billion 
this increase was due to higher employee related costs and higher administrative expenses 
higher employee related costs principally reflect the increase in number of employees during the year and included higher salaries and wages  higher accruals for performance based compensation and higher benefit expenses 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates declined to million 
the decline in earnings from the company s equity investee  wilmar  was partially offset by higher earnings of the company s equity investee  gruma  in part due to a gain on gruma s disposition of certain assets

bioproducts results included startup costs related to the company s new plants of million in compared to million in the prior year 
agricultural services operating profit increased to billion 
merchandising and handling results increased due to higher corn and wheat sales volumes and higher margins 
a large us harvest combined with strong international demand resulted in higher us export shipments 
merchandising and handling results in included an insurance recovery of million related to property damage and business interruption resulting from an october explosion at the company s destrehan  la  export facility 
international merchandising results were weaker in part due to positions impacted by unexpected shifts in crop supply caused by weather conditions and government actions in the black sea region 
transportation results increased million to million primarily due to higher barge freight rates and higher barge utilization levels  in part due to higher us export volumes 
milling and other results improved due principally to increased equity earnings from the company s equity investee  gruma which include a million gain related to gruma s disposal of certain assets 
other financial operating profit decreased to million primarily due to higher captive insurance loss provisions principally related to a million loss related to the company s destrehan  la  export facility insurance claim
