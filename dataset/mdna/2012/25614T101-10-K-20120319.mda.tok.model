results of operations for the fiscal years ended december  and revenue year ended year ended december  december  change revenue printing   packaging   plastic ids and cards   licensing and digital solutions   total revenue   revenue for the year ended december   revenue was approximately million  nearly identical to revenue for the year ended december  printing revenue declined which was primarily the result of a significant decline in external sales at the company s commercial printing division  driven by the general decline in the company s commercial printing business that began in the second half of caused by the loss of a large direct mail customer along with a strategic reduction in the level of low profit margin commercial printing that the company has determined does not fit its long term business model 
in addition  the company increased the usage of its production capacity for the internal printing for its packaging division 
the company s packaging revenue increased during as compared to while the company s plastics division revenue increased

as a result  gross profit increased during the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the significant increases in gross profits in the company s packaging and plastics divisions due to favorable product sales mixes for each  along with a decrease in equipment lease costs which further favorably impacted the plastics division 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in gross profits from the company s printing division  which reflects the impact of the significant declines in commercial printing revenues causing fixed costs of sales to be a much larger percentage of cost of sales than comparable levels 
gross profits from licensing and digital sales increased primarily due to the addition of gross profits from the company s new acquisition  extradev  which occurred in may operating expenses year ended december  year ended december  change operating expenses sales  general and administrative compensation  professional fees   sales and marketing   research and development   rent and utilities   other   other operating expenses depreciation and software amortization   stock based compensation   impairment of patents  amortization of intangibles   total operating expenses   sales  general and administrative compensation costs were higher during as compared to which reflect additions in sales and marketing personnel made during along with the addition of seven people from the company s digital division

amortization of intangibles expense decreased in as compared to due to the reduction in the company s net capitalized patent acquisition and defense costs asset and completion of amortization of intangibles in the plastics division early in  offset by increases in intangible asset amortization as a result of the acquisition of other intangible assets in conjunction with the company s acquisition of extradev in may other income and expenses year ended december  year ended december  change other income expense change in fair value of derivative liability  interest expense   amortizaton of note discount  loss in equity investment  other income  other income expense  net   change in fair value of derivative liability in late  the company issued various financial instruments to an investor in connection with a stock purchase agreement which contained certain provisions that resulted in a derivative liability 
on february  the company entered into certain amendments with the investor for the purpose of modifying the terms of the financial instruments that among other things eliminated the provisions of the financial instruments that had created the derivative liabilities 
as a result  the company determined the fair value of the derivative liability as of the modification date of february  and recorded the change in fair value of the derivative liability from december  of  in the statement of operations 
interest expense during  interest expense decreased as a result of a decreased in interest rates achieved by the company due to the refinancing and paydowns of certain debts during  with the highest rates of interest 
amortization of note discount during  the company entered into two convertible notes that had conversion features at below fair value and therefore  a beneficial conversion feature 
accordingly  the company determined that a total of approximately  of note discount had been created as a result of the beneficial conversion features and a warrant issued with the debt 
the company was amortizing this expense over the expected life of the convertible notes

net loss and loss per share year ended december  year ended december  change net loss   net loss per share  basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding  basic and diluted during  the company had a net loss of  representing a decrease from the net loss of the decrease in net loss was primarily the result of an increase in the company s gross profit due to an improved product sales mix and an increase in net other income  offset by an increase in operating expenses and a significant decrease in deferred tax benefit 
without the impact of the difference in deferred tax benefit between and  the company s net loss would have reflected a year over year decrease of approximately

the company agreed to extend the maturity date of the note until july   and to structure the note as a convertible note under which the investor has a right to convert the principal and any accrued interest due thereunder into shares of the company s common stock  at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon the happening of certain corporate events set forth in the transaction agreements 
the company s purpose for entering into the transaction was to provide the possibility that the indebtedness under the original note would be converted to equity in the near future 
operating cash flow during  the company used approximately million of cash for operations  a increase from our use of cash for operations in  which generally reflected the company s paydown of accounts payables and an increase in payments for inventory

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  an effect on our financial condition  financial statements  revenues or expenses 
inflation although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions  we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during or as we are generally able to pass the increase in our material and labor costs to our customers  or absorb them as we improve the efficiency of our operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  goodwill impairments  inventory allowances  revenue recognition  stock based compensation valuations  the valuation of intangible assets  and allocation of assets in business combinations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the assets 
fixed assets are carried at cost 
depreciation is computed over the estimated useful life of five to seven years using the straight line depreciation method 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful life or the lease term 
intangible assets consist primarily of royalty rights  contractual rights  customer list  and patent acquisition  application and defense costs 
amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of five to twenty years using the straight line depreciation method 
for patent related assets  the remaining legal life of the patent is used as the estimate useful life unless circumstances determine that the useful life will be less than the legal life 
long lived assets to be held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets based on estimated future cash flows from and the estimated fair value of such long lived assets  and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicated the carrying amount may be impaired 
asc topic provides an entity with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
if the two step impairment test is necessary  a fair value based test is applied at the reporting unit level  which is generally one level below the operating segment level 
the test compares the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
this test requires various judgments and estimates 
the company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit using a market approach in combination with a discounted operating cash flow approach 
impairment of goodwill is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the fair values of recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
an adjustment to goodwill will be recorded for any goodwill that is determined to be impaired 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually in conjunction with preparation of its annual business plan  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
asu modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the company performed the annual assessment and has determined that no impairment is necessary during the years ended december  and other intangible assets and patent defense costs other intangible assets consists of costs associated with the application  acquisition and defense of the company s patents  contractual rights to patents and trade secrets associated with the company s technologies  a non exclusive licensing agreement  and customer lists obtained as a result of acquisitions 
the company s patents and trade secrets are for document anti counterfeiting and anti scanning technologies and processes that form the basis of the company s document security business 
patent application costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the patent  which generally approximates its legal life 
external legal costs incurred to defend the company s patents are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patents and an expected successful outcome 
patent defense costs are expensed at the point when it is determined that the outcome is expected to be unsuccessful 
the company capitalizes the cost of an appeal until it is determined that the appeal will be unsuccessful 
the company s capitalized patent defense costs expenses are analyzed for impairment based on the expected eventual outcome of the legal action and recoverability of proceeds or added economic value of the patent in excess of the costs 
legal actions related to the same patent defense case are unified into one asset group for the purposes on the impairment analysis 
the company amortizes its other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
patents are amortized over the remaining legal life  up to years 
intangible asset amortization expense is generally classified as an operating expense 
the company believes that the decision to incur patent costs is discretionary as the associated products or services can be sold prior to or during the application process 
the company accounts for other intangible amortization as an operating expense  unless the underlying asset is directly associated with the production or delivery of a product 
to date  the amount of related amortization expense for other intangible assets directly attributable to revenue recognized is not material 
there was no impairment charges during the year ended december  impairment of patent acquisition costs of  was recognized in the fourth quarter of as a result of adverse decisions in the company s patent infringement case against the ecb which caused the company to reduce the estimated cash flows that supported the company s capitalized patent acquisition based intangible asset 
conventional convertible debt when the convertible feature of the conventional convertible debt provides for a rate of conversion that is below market value  this feature is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature bcf 
prior to the determination of the bcf  the proceeds from the debt instrument were first allocated between the convertible debt and any embedded or detachable free standing instruments that are included  such as common stock warrants 
we record a bcf as a debt discount pursuant to fasb asc topic in those circumstances  the convertible debt will be recorded net of the discount related to the bcf 
we amortize the discount to interest expense over the life of the debt using the effective interest method 
revenue recognition sales of security and commercial printing products  packaging  and plastic cards are recognized when a product or service is delivered  shipped or provided to the customer and all material conditions relating to the sale have been substantially performed 
the company recognizes revenue from printing technology licenses once all the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the right and ability to use the product or technology has been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment  and collection of the amounts due is reasonably assured 
for digital solutions sales  revenue is recognized in accordance with the fasb asc accordingly  revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service or product has been provided to the customer  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable  and the collection of our fees is reasonably assured 
we recognize cloud computing revenue  including data backup  recovery and security services  on a monthly basis  beginning on the date the customer commences use of our services 
professional services are recognized in the period services are provided 
business combinations business combinations and non controlling interests are recorded in accordance with the business combination topic of the fasb asc 
under the guidance  the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values is recorded as goodwill 
if the fair value of the assets acquired exceeds the purchase price and the liabilities assumed then a gain on acquisition is recorded 
under the guidance  all acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and in process research and development costs are recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset 
the application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
share based payments we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation expense over the service period for which awards are expected to vest 
the company uses the black scholes merton option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
the black scholes merton model requires the use of subjective assumptions which determine the fair value of stock based awards  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services the company determines the measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued at the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or ii the date at which the consultant or vendor s performance is complete 
in the case of equity instruments issued to consultants  the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant utilizing the black scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table 
year ended december  volatility expected option term years years risk free interest rate expected forfeiture rate expected dividend yield income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
fasb asc requires that a valuation allowance be established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets on an annual basis and a valuation allowance is provided or released  as necessary 
since the company has had cumulative losses in recent years  the accounting guidance suggest that we should not look to future earnings to support the realizability of the net deferred tax asset 
as a result  as of the years ended december  and  the company has elected to record a valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to zero 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to deferred tax valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates because the need for valuation allowance is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to changes in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances  the need for valuation allowance is susceptible to actual operating results and changes in the tax valuation allowance can have a material impact on the tax provisions benefit in the consolidated statements of operations and on deferred income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets 
investment valuation and deconsolidation on october   the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with internet media services whereby the company sold the assets and liabilities of legalstore  a division of the company  in exchange for  shares of common stock of internet media services 
the company recorded its investment in internet media services as an equity method investment at the fair market value of the business sold 
management determined that the transaction did not qualify as a non monetary exchange due to the exception noted in fasb asc a transfer of assets to an entity in exchange for an equity interest in that entity 
management determined that the transaction qualified as a derecoginition of a subsidiary under fasb asc therefore  the company accounted for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary the business by recording the consideration received at fair market value and recognizing a gain in net income measured as the difference between the fair value of the consideration received  shares of common stock of internet media services or a interest and the carrying value of the assets and liabilities sold 
given that the consideration received was not readily measurable because of the lack of activity in internet media services shares prior to the transaction  the company determined that the value of the business transferred was more readily measurable by determining the fair market value of the business transferred based on a discounted cash flow model 
the company recorded the equity method investment at fair value 
under the equity method investment the company is required to account for the difference between the cost of an investment and the amount of the underlying equity in net assets of an investee as if the investee were a consolidated subsidiary 
if the investor is unable to relate the difference to specific accounts of the investee eg  property and equipment  the difference should be considered to be the same as goodwill 
investors should not amortize goodwill associated with equity method investments after the date fasb asc is initially applied by the entity in its entirety 
the company determined that given the lack of activity in internet media services shares prior to the transaction  the difference between the cost of the investment fair market value and the underlying equity interest is attributable to goodwill 
the company reported the activity in operating loss and not as discontinued operations because the operations and cash flows of the component had not been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the equity method investment and because the company had significant continuing involvement in the operations of internet media services after the disposal transaction because of its ownership percentage and board representation 
on september   the company s board of directors declared a dividend which provided for the distribution by the company to its stockholders of record on october   on a pro rata basis  of its  shares of stock in internet media services 
the dividend was recorded at approximately  which was the book value of the investment as of september  fair value of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the fair value measurement topic of the fasb asc establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions  such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable 
the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the immediate or short term maturity of these financial instruments 
the fair value of revolving credit lines  notes payable and long term debt approximates their carrying value as the stated or discounted rates of the debt reflect recent market conditions 
derivative instruments are recorded as assets and liabilities at estimated fair value based on available market information 
derivative instruments the company maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate swap contracts to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility 
the company has two interest rate swaps that change variable rates into fixed rates on two term loans 
these swaps qualify as level fair value financial instruments 
these swap agreements are not held for trading purposes and the company does not intend to sell the derivative swap financial instruments 
the company records the interest swap agreements on the balance sheet at fair value because the agreements qualify as a cash flow hedges under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income loss until the underlying transaction is recorded in earnings 
when the hedged item is realized  gains or losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci to the consolidated statement of operations on the same line item as the underlying transaction 
the valuations of the interest rate swaps have been derived from proprietary models of the bank based upon recognized financial principles and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions and may reflect certain other financial factors such as anticipated profit or hedging  transactional  and other costs 
the notional amounts of the swaps decrease over the life of the agreements 
the company is exposed to a credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties to the interest rate swap agreements 
however  the company does not anticipate non performance by the counter parties 
the cumulative net loss attributable to this cash flow hedge recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and other liabilities at december   was approximately   december  
the company has notional amounts of approximately  as of december  on its interest rate swap agreements for its citizens bank debt 
the company has two interest rate swaps that change variable rates into fixed rates on two term loans and the terms of these instruments are as follows notional amount variable rate fixed cost maturity date  february   august  the company accounts for warrants and other rights to acquire capital stock with exercise price reset features  or down round provisions  as derivative liabilities 
similarly  down round provisions for issuances of common stock are also accounted for as derivative liabilities 
these derivative liabilities are measured at fair value with the changes in fair value at the end of each period reflected in current period income or loss 
the fair value of derivative liabilities is estimated using a binomial model or monte carlo simulation to model the financial characteristics  depending on the complexity of the derivative being measured 
a monte carlo simulation provides a more accurate valuation than standard option valuation methodologies such as the black scholes merton binomial option models when derivatives include changing exercise prices or different alternatives depending on average future price targets 
in computing the fair value of the derivatives  the company uses significant judgments  which  if incorrect  could have a significant negative impact to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the input values for determining the fair value of the derivatives include observable market indices such as interest rates  and equity indices as well as unobservable model specific input values such as certain volatility parameters 
future changes in the fair value of the derivatives liabilities  if any  will be recorded in the statement of operations as gains or losses from derivative liabilities 
the derivative liability resulting from the warrant is classified as a level measurement

 intangibles goodwill and other topic  testing goodwill for impairment 
the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
under this standard  the company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  performing the two step impairment test under topic is unnecessary 
however  if the company concludes otherwise  it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test  as described in topic if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value under the first step  the company is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the company also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and to proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
the company may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
this standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   and early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
