see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
healthcare operations we are organized into four operating divisions the hospital division  the nursing center division  the rehabilitation division and the home health and hospice division 
the expansion of our home health and hospice operations and changes to our organizational structure have led us to segregate our home health and hospice business into a separate division 
our home health and hospice business was previously included in the rehabilitation division 
for more information about our operating divisions  as well as financial information  see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the hospital division operates ltac hospitals and irfs 
the nursing center division operates nursing and rehabilitation centers and assisted living facilities 
the rehabilitation division provides rehabilitation services primarily in hospitals and long term care settings 
the home health and hospice division provides home health  hospice and private duty services to patients in a variety of settings  including homes  skilled nursing facilities and other residential settings 
we believe that the independent focus of each division on the unique aspects of its business enhances its ability to attract patients  residents and non affiliated customers  improve the quality of its operations and achieve operating efficiencies 
based upon the authoritative guidance for business segments and after giving consideration to our business segments after the rehabcare merger  our operating divisions represent five reportable operating segments  including i hospitals  ii skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers  iii skilled nursing based rehabilitation contract therapy services srs  iv hospital based rehabilitation contract therapy services hrs and v home health and hospice services 
the srs and hrs operating segments are both contained within the rehabilitation division 
prior period business segment information has been restated to conform with the current period presentation 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
competitive strengths we believe that several competitive strengths support our business strategy  including well diversified service offerings across the post acute continuum 
through our organic development and acquisitions  we have created a well diversified portfolio of service offerings 
the rehabcare merger added irfs to our existing service offerings as well as significantly increased the scale of our contract rehabilitation services business and ltac hospital business 
following the rehabcare merger  kindred operates the largest network of ltac hospitals and irfs and is the largest operator of skilled nursing contract rehabilitation therapy services in the united states based upon revenues 
we also are the fourth largest operator of skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers in the united states 
this array of services creates multiple earnings streams and multiple avenues for growth and further development 

table of contents uniquely positioned for bundled or episodic payment environment 
as healthcare reform is implemented  we believe that healthcare providers that can operate with scale across the continuum of care will have a competitive advantage in an episodic payment environment 
our diversified service offerings enable us both to do this effectively and to participate with other healthcare providers in determining the most appropriate setting for patients as they continue their care throughout a post acute episode 
with the completion of the rehabcare merger  we are a leader in four critical segments of the post acute continuum  well positioned to enhance our cluster market strategy of delivering the right care at the right site of service 
we also are positioned to become a valuable partner to short term acute care hospitals and managed care organizations  which are seeking to increase care coordination and more effectively manage healthcare costs 
strong asset base including owned real estate 
we have been focused on adding high quality assets to our balance sheet through opportunistic acquisitions and development of state of the art ltac hospitals and transitional care centers in our skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers 
we own the real estate of ltac hospitals  one irf  nursing and rehabilitation centers and two assisted living facilities  a significant increase from the facilities we owned in strong cash flow generation 
we have demonstrated the ability to generate strong operating cash flows in a highly regulated environment 
our operating cash flows offer opportunities to fund our acquisition and development strategies as well as reduce our leverage over time 
proven and experienced management team 
we have an industry leading management team with strong executive leadership and experience in executing and integrating strategic acquisitions 
paul j 
diaz  president and chief executive officer  has over years experience in the healthcare industry 
with the inclusion of key operating officers from rehabcare  we believe our management team has demonstrated the ability to adapt and respond to an ever changing healthcare environment 
our strategy we believe that we are the largest diversified post acute provider in the united states  and accordingly  are well positioned to grow and succeed in what will be an increasingly integrated healthcare delivery system 
the core of our strategy is to provide superior clinical outcomes and quality care with an approach that is patient centered and focused on lowering costs by reducing lengths of stay in short term acute care hospitals and transitioning patients to their homes at the highest possible level of function 
the key elements of our operating strategy include provide quality  clinical based care 
we are committed to maintaining and improving the quality of our patient care by dedicating appropriate resources at each facility and continuing to refine our clinical initiatives and objectives 
we also have implemented technology enhancements and clinical protocols that promote best practices 
improve operating efficiency 
we are continually focused on improving operating efficiency and controlling costs  while maintaining quality patient care  by standardizing key operating procedures and optimizing the skill mix of our staff based upon the clinical needs of each patient or resident 
we have implemented specialized programs and technology enhancements to improve our quality and to make our caregivers more efficient 
increase patient and resident volumes  particularly commercial patients 
we continue to expand our sales and marketing functions in our hospital and nursing center divisions to grow same facility admissions and to take advantage of available capacity 
given the relatively higher reimbursement rates from commercial insurers as a group  as compared to medicare and medicaid  we continue to focus on expanding our relationships 
table of contents with insurers and enhancing their understanding of our services in order to increase commercial patient volume 
since  we have grown our annual non government admissions in our hospitals by approximately and increased our non government patient days in our nursing and rehabilitation centers by approximately 
we believe that our expanded service offerings and scope of operations will be attractive to commercial payors 
improve and expand relationships with referring providers 
substantially all of the patients and residents admitted to our hospitals and nursing and rehabilitation centers are referred to us by other healthcare providers such as general short term acute care hospitals  intensive care units  managed care programs  physicians  and other healthcare providers 
accordingly  we are focused on maintaining strong relationships with these providers as well as developing more comprehensive relationships with physician groups

in  we acquired a home health company that operates in locations 
we intend to expand our home health and hospice operations through additional acquisitions or de novo sites  particularly in cluster markets where we have other healthcare operations 
grow through development in cluster markets 
our hospitals and nursing center divisions are increasingly focused on the opportunities available in markets where we operate multiple hospitals or have affiliated hospitals or nursing and rehabilitation centers 
these cluster markets present opportunities for our hospitals and nursing and rehabilitation centers to share centralized business office operations and collaborate on their sales and marketing and managed care strategies 
our expanded rehabilitation business and home health and hospice operations furthers the continuum of care we can provide in these cluster markets 
these cluster markets also allow us to better coordinate and manage the continuum of care for our patients  implement physician services strategies and reduce re hospitalizations 
re deploy assets and management time to higher margin growth businesses 
we intend to concentrate our efforts on higher margin businesses such as home health and hospice and contract rehabilitation 
in addition  we continue to allocate capital to the development of ltac hospitals  irfs and transitional care centers  particularly in cluster markets where we have other healthcare operations 
we also continue to review our hospital and nursing and rehabilitation center operations to divest or eliminate under performing facilities 
grow through selective acquisitions 
we seek growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions in selected target markets  particularly where an acquisition  such as the rehabcare merger and the professional acquisition  may assist us in scaling our operations more rapidly and efficiently than internal growth 
in  our acquisition of rehabcare significantly expanded the scope of our hospital and rehabilitation operations as well as added irfs to our post acute continuum 
we also completed the professional acquisition which significantly expanded our home health and hospice operations 
in  we acquired four freestanding ltac hospitals and one ltac hospital within a host hospital hih with a total of hospital beds  four nursing and rehabilitation centers with a total of nursing and rehabilitation center beds and one assisted living facility with assisted living beds 
grow our hospital division through business development 
our hospital growth strategy is also focused on the development and expansion of our services freestanding hospitals and irfs 
at december   we operated freestanding hospitals  licensed beds and five irfs licensed beds 
during  we opened one freestanding hospital which added a total of licensed beds 
during  we opened one freestanding hospital and two replacement hospitals which added a total of licensed beds 
at december   we have under development two replacement hospitals which will add licensed beds and one new irf and one replacement irf which will add licensed beds to our capacity 

table of contents sub acute units 
we are well positioned to develop sub acute units in several of our hospitals to broaden our scope of services  promote higher quality care and take advantage of unused capacity 
at december   we operated nine sub acute units with licensed beds  have three hospital based sub acute units with licensed beds under development  and plan to expand one existing sub acute unit by licensed beds 
hospital in hospital units 
we have contracts with non kindred short term acute care and other hospitals to operate hihs 
under these arrangements  we lease space and purchase certain ancillary services from the host hospital and provide it with the option to discharge a portion of its clinically appropriate patients into the care of our hospital 
these hihs also receive patients from other general short term acute care hospitals 
during  we acquired one hih with licensed beds 
at december   we operated hihs with  licensed beds 
expand program development of our hospital division 
we are a leading provider of long term acute care to patients with pulmonary dysfunction 
in addition  we have developed and continue to expand other inpatient and outpatient service areas such as wound care  post surgical care  acute rehabilitation  pain management  as well as new intensive care units  where we believe opportunities exist to position our hospitals as centers of excellence in certain markets 
we also continue to expand our sub acute programs in selected markets where we believe there is a need for our services and where we have unused capacity 
improve portfolio of nursing and rehabilitation centers 
our nursing center division continually seeks to improve its existing portfolio 
we have opened a newly constructed transitional care center with nursing and rehabilitation center beds during  acquired four nursing and rehabilitation centers with a total of nursing and rehabilitation center beds and one assisted living facility with assisted living beds during  expanded our transitional care centers and transitional care units to address the needs of more medicare and managed care short term patients  announced our intention to allow the leases for nursing and rehabilitation centers with  licensed beds to expire in  and divested or did not renew leases for nine underperforming nursing and rehabilitation centers with approximately  licensed beds in the last three years 
continue effective recruiting and retention of qualified therapists 
our rehabilitation division continuously strives to recruit and retain qualified therapists in an industry wide employment environment characterized by a shortage of qualified personnel 
we offer competitive incentive and recognition programs for our therapists and have increased our recruiting infrastructure to reduce open positions  decrease contract labor and improve productivity 
we also promote continuing education opportunities to enhance the personal knowledge and growth of our therapists and encourage our therapists participation in nurturing a culture of quality and customer service 
grow through business development and external contract sales

table of contents hospital division our hospital division provides long term acute care services to medically complex patients through the operation of a national network of ltac hospitals with  licensed beds and five irfs with licensed beds in states as of december  we operate the largest network of ltac hospitals and irfs in the united states based upon fiscal revenues 
as a result of our commitment to the hospital business  we have developed a comprehensive program of care for medically complex patients that allows us to deliver high quality care in a cost effective manner 
a number of our hospitals also provide skilled nursing  sub acute and outpatient services 
outpatient services may include diagnostic services  rehabilitation therapy  ct scanning  one day surgery and laboratory 
in our ltac hospitals  we treat medically complex patients  including the critically ill  suffering from multiple organ system failures  most commonly of the cardiovascular  pulmonary  kidney  gastro intestinal and cutaneous skin systems 
in particular  we have a core competency in treating patients with cardio pulmonary disorders  skin and wound conditions  and life threatening infections 
prior to being admitted to one of our ltac hospitals  many of our patients have undergone a major surgical procedure or developed a neurological disorder following head and spinal cord injury  cerebrovascular incident or metabolic instability 
our expertise lies in the ability to simultaneously deliver comprehensive and coordinated medical interventions directed at all affected organ systems  while maintaining a patient centered  integrated care plan 
medically complex patients are characteristically dependent on technology for continued life support  including mechanical ventilation  total parenteral nutrition  respiratory or cardiac monitors and kidney dialysis machines 
during  the average length of stay for patients in our hospitals was approximately days 
our ltac hospital patients generally have conditions that require a high level of monitoring and specialized care  yet may not need the services of a traditional intensive care unit 
these patients are not clinically appropriate for admission to other post acute settings because their severe medical conditions are periodically or chronically unstable 
by providing a range of services required for the care of medically complex patients  we believe that our ltac hospitals provide our patients with high quality  cost effective care 
our ltac hospitals employ a comprehensive program of care for their patients that draws upon the talents of interdisciplinary teams  including physician specialists 
the teams evaluate patients upon admission to determine treatment programs 
our hospital division has developed specialized treatment programs focused on the needs of medically complex patients 
in addition to traditional medical services  most of our ltac hospital patients receive individualized treatment plans  which may include rehabilitation  skin integrity management and clinical pharmacology services 
where appropriate  the treatment programs may involve the services of several disciplines  such as pulmonary medicine  infectious disease and physical medicine 
our irfs provide services to patients who require intensive inpatient rehabilitative care 
our irf patients typically experience significant physical disabilities due to various medical conditions  such as head injury  spinal cord injury  stroke  hip fractures  certain orthopedic problems  and neuromuscular disease  and require rehabilitative healthcare services in an inpatient setting 
our nurses and physical  occupational  and speech therapists work with physicians with the goal of returning patients to home and work 
patient care is provided by nursing and therapy staff as directed by physician orders 
our irfs provide an interdisciplinary approach to treatment that leads to a higher level of care and superior outcomes 
the medical  nursing  therapy  and ancillary services provided by our irfs comply with local  state  and federal regulations  as well as other accreditation standards

table of contents quality assessment and improvement the hospital division maintains a clinical outcomes and customer service program which includes a review of its patient population measured against utilization and quality standards  clinical outcomes data collection and patient family  employee and physician satisfaction surveys 
in addition  our hospitals have integrated quality assurance and improvement programs administered by a director of quality management  which encompass quality improvement  infection control and risk management 
the objective of these programs is to ensure that patients are managed appropriately in our hospitals and that quality healthcare is provided in a cost effective manner 
the hospital division has implemented a program whereby its ltac hospitals and irfs are reviewed by internal quality auditors for compliance with standards of the joint commission or the american osteopathic association the aoa 
the purposes of this internal review process are to ensure ongoing compliance with industry recognized standards for hospitals  assist management in analyzing each hospital s operations and provide consulting and educational programs for each hospital to identify opportunities to improve patient care 
hospital division management and operations each of our ltac hospitals has a fully credentialed  multi specialty medical staff to meet the needs of the medically complex  long term acute patient 
our ltac hospitals offer a broad range of physician services including pulmonology  internal medicine  infectious diseases  neurology  nephrology  cardiology  radiology and pathology 
in addition  our ltac hospitals have a multi disciplinary team of healthcare professionals  including a professional nursing staff trained to care for long term acute patients  respiratory  physical  occupational and speech therapists  pharmacists  registered dietitians and social workers  to address the needs of medically complex patients 
each ltac hospital utilizes a pre admission assessment system to evaluate clinical needs and other information in determining the appropriateness of each potential patient admission 
after admission  each patient s case is reviewed by the ltac hospital s interdisciplinary team to determine a care plan 
typically  and where appropriate  the care plan involves the services of several disciplines  such as pulmonary medicine  infectious disease and physical medicine 
a hospital chief executive officer or administrator supervises and is responsible for the day to day operations at each of our hospitals 
each hospital or network of hospitals also employs a chief financial officer who monitors the financial matters of such hospital or network 
within selected markets having a significant concentration of hospitals  administrative functions such as billing and collections may be shared to improve efficiency 
in addition  each hospital or network of hospitals employs a chief clinical officer to oversee the clinical operations and a director of quality management to oversee our quality assurance programs 
we provide centralized services in the areas of information systems design and development  training  reimbursement expertise  legal advice  tax  technical accounting support  purchasing and facilities management to each of our hospitals 
we believe that this centralization improves efficiency  promotes the standardization of certain processes and allows staff in our hospitals to focus more attention on patient care 
a division president and a chief financial officer manage the hospital division 
the operations of the hospital division are divided into a central region  a southeast region and a west region  each headed by a senior officer of the division who reports to the division president 
the clinical issues and quality concerns of the hospital division are managed by the division s chief medical officer and senior vice president of clinical operations 

table of contents hospital division competition in each geographic market that we serve  there are generally several competitors that provide similar services to those provided by our hospital division 
in addition  several of the markets in which the hospital division operates have other ltac hospitals and irfs that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals 
certain competing hospitals are operated by not for profit  non taxpaying or governmental agencies  which can finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis and receive funds and charitable contributions unavailable to our hospital division 
competition for patients covered by non government reimbursement sources is intense 
the primary competitive factors in the ltac hospital and irf business include quality of services  charges for services and responsiveness to the needs of patients  families  payors and physicians 
other companies have entered the ltac hospital and irf business with licensed hospitals that compete with our hospitals 
the competitive position of any ltac hospital and irf also is affected by the ability of its management to negotiate contracts with purchasers of  and to receive referrals from  group healthcare services  including managed care companies  preferred provider organizations and health maintenance organizations 
such organizations attempt to obtain discounts from established charges  as well as to limit their overall expenditures by compressing average lengths of stay 
the importance of obtaining contracts with preferred provider organizations  health maintenance organizations and other organizations that finance healthcare varies from market to market  depending on the number and market strength of such organizations 
nursing center division our nursing center division provides quality  cost effective care through the operation of a national network of nursing and rehabilitation centers  licensed beds and six assisted living facilities licensed beds located in states as of december  we are the largest publicly held operator of nursing and rehabilitation centers in the united states based upon our fiscal revenues of approximately billion 
through our nursing and rehabilitation centers  we provide short stay patients and long stay residents with a full range of medical  nursing  rehabilitative  pharmacy and routine services  including daily dietary  social and recreational services 
consistent with industry trends  patients and residents admitted to our nursing and rehabilitation centers arrive with greater medical complexity and require a more extensive and costly level of care 
this is particularly true with our medicare population for whom the average length of stay in was days 
to appropriately care for a higher acuity short stay patient population and a more frail and unstable long stay resident population  we are taking steps to improve the delivery of the clinical and hospitality services offered to our patients and residents by adjusting the level of clinical and hospitality staffing  assisting physician oversight through the selective use of nurse practitioners  enhancing nursing skills via ongoing education and competency evaluations and improving clinical case management through the employment of clinical case managers 
we operate transitional care units at of our nursing and rehabilitation centers

our transitional care units enhance our ability to care for the higher acuity short term patients typically associated with medicare  medicare advantage and commercial insurance payors 
several of our nursing and rehabilitation centers have clinical programs focused primarily upon the patient population arriving for recovery  recuperation and rehabilitation 
we refer to this patient population as transitional care patients and the nursing and rehabilitation centers providing these higher level clinical services as transitional care centers 
we currently classify of our nursing and rehabilitation centers as transitional care centers 

table of contents at a number of our nursing and rehabilitation centers  we offer specialized programs for residents with alzheimer s disease and other dementias through our reflections units 
we have developed specific certification criteria for these units 
these units are operated by teams of professionals that are dedicated to addressing the unique problems experienced by residents with alzheimer s disease or other dementias 
we believe that we are a leading provider of nursing care to residents with alzheimer s disease and dementia based upon the specialization and size of our program 
we also monitor and enhance the quality of care and customer service at our nursing and rehabilitation centers through the use of performance improvement committees and family satisfaction surveys 
our performance improvement committees oversee resident healthcare needs and resident and staff safety 
physician medical directors serve on these committees and advise on healthcare policies and practices 
we regularly conduct surveys of residents and their families  and these surveys are reviewed by our performance improvement committees at each center to promote quality care and customer service 
an increasingly important performance improvement initiative is a division wide focus on reducing potentially avoidable hospitalizations 
the clinical leadership of each center is actively engaged in improving nursing competencies and communication skills  developing specific clinical programs to address acute care needs that may arise on site and working collaboratively with the medical community to coordinate monitoring and treatment 
substantially all of our nursing and rehabilitation centers are certified to provide services under the medicare and medicaid programs 
our nursing and rehabilitation centers have been certified because the quality of our services  accommodations  equipment  safety  personnel  physical environment and policies and procedures meet or exceed the standards of certification set by those programs

table of contents sources of nursing and rehabilitation center revenues nursing and rehabilitation center revenues are derived principally from the medicare and medicaid programs and private and other payors 
consistent with the nursing center industry  changes in the mix of the patient and resident population among these categories significantly affect the profitability of our nursing and rehabilitation center operations 
although higher acuity patients generally produce the most revenue per patient day  profitability with respect to higher acuity patients is impacted by the costs associated with the higher level of nursing care and other services generally required 
in addition  these patients usually have a significantly shorter length of stay 
the following table sets forth the approximate percentages of nursing and rehabilitation center patient days and revenues derived from the payor sources indicated medicare medicaid medicare advantage private and other year ended december  patient days revenues patient days revenues patient days revenues patient days revenues for the year ended december   revenues of the nursing center division totaled approximately billion or of our total revenues before eliminations

these programs are designed to maintain high levels of quality patient and resident care  with an orientation towards regulatory compliance 
substantially all of our nursing and rehabilitation centers are certified to provide services under the medicare and medicaid programs 
a nursing center s qualification to participate in such programs depends upon many factors  such as accommodations  equipment  clinical services  safety  personnel  physical environment and adequacy of policies and procedures 
nursing center division competition our nursing and rehabilitation centers compete with other nursing centers and similar long term care facilities primarily on the basis of quality of care  reputation  location and physical appearance and  in the case of private payment residents  the charges for our services 
our nursing and rehabilitation centers also compete on a local and regional basis with other facilities providing similar services  including hospitals  extended care centers  assisted living facilities  home health agencies and similar institutions 
some competitors may operate newer facilities and may provide services that we do not offer 
our competitors include government owned  religious organization owned  secular not for profit and for profit institutions 
many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
although there is limited  if any  price competition with respect to medicare and medicaid residents since revenues received for services provided to these residents are based generally on fixed rates  there is substantial price competition for private payment residents

we are organized into two operating segments skilled nursing rehabilitation services srs and hospital rehabilitation services hrs 
our srs operations provide contract therapy services primarily to freestanding skilled nursing centers 
as of december   our srs segment provided rehabilitative services to  nursing centers in states 
our hrs operations provide program management and therapy services on an inpatient basis in hospital based inpatient rehabilitation units  ltac hospitals  sub acute or skilled nursing units  as well as on an outpatient basis to hospital based and other satellite programs 
as of december   our hrs segment operated hospital based inpatient rehabilitation units and provided rehabilitation services in ltac hospitals  sub acute or skilled nursing units  and outpatient clinics 
srs operations our srs operations involve therapy management services provided primarily to freestanding skilled nursing centers allowing our customers to fulfill their continuing need for therapists on a full time or part time basis without the need to hire and retain full time staff 
as of december   srs managed  contract therapy programs 
we are the largest contract therapy company in the united states based upon fiscal revenues of approximately million 
srs provides specialized rehabilitation programs designed to meet the individual needs of the residents and patients we serve 
our specialized care programs address complex medical needs  such as wound care  pain management  and cognitive retraining  in addition to programs for neurologic  orthopedic  cardiac and pulmonary conditions such as stroke  fractures and other orthopedic conditions 
we also provide clinical education and programming which is developed and supported by our clinical experts 
these programs are implemented in an effort to ensure clinical practices that support the provision of quality rehabilitation services in accordance with applicable standards of care 
srs recruits and retains qualified professionals with the clinical expertise to provide quality patient care and measurable rehabilitation outcomes 
our rehabilitation division also provides regulatory guidance and compliance support that benefits our clients and their residents and patients 
hrs operations our hrs operations provide program management and therapy services on an inpatient basis in hospital based inpatient rehabilitation units  ltac hospitals  sub acute or skilled nursing units  as well as on an outpatient basis to hospital based and other satellite programs 
hospital based inpatient rehabilitation units 
we are a leading operator of hospital based inpatient rehabilitation units on a contract basis 
as of december   we managed hospital based inpatient rehabilitation units 
the hospital based inpatient rehabilitation units we operate provide high acuity rehabilitation for patients recovering from strokes  orthopedic conditions and head injuries 
we establish hospital based inpatient rehabilitation units in acute care hospitals that have vacant space and unmet rehabilitation needs in their markets 
we also work with acute care hospitals that currently operate hospital based inpatient rehabilitation units to improve the delivery of clinical services to patients by implementing our scheduling  clinical protocol and outcome systems  as well as through time management training for existing staff 
in the case of acute care hospitals that do not operate hospital based inpatient rehabilitation units  we review their historical and existing hospital population  as well as the demographics of the geographic region  to determine the optimal size of the proposed hospital based inpatient rehabilitation units and the potential of the new facility under our management to attract patients and generate revenues sufficient to cover anticipated expenses 
our relationships with these hospitals are customarily in the form of contracts for management services which are typically three to five years in duration 

table of contents a hospital based acute rehabilitation unit within a hospital affords the hospital the ability to offer rehabilitation services to patients who might otherwise be discharged to a setting outside the acute care hospital  thus improving the ability to provide a full continuum of care and consistency in clinical services and outcomes 
a hospital based acute rehabilitation unit within a hospital typically consists of beds and is staffed with a program director  a rehabilitation physician or medical director  and clinical staff  which may include a psychologist  physical and occupational therapists  a speech language pathologist  a social worker  a case manager and other appropriate support personnel 
ltac hospitals 
we also provide rehabilitation and program management services  including physical and occupational therapies and speech pathology services  to ltac hospitals 
we provide specialized care programs that support patients with complex medical needs  such as wound care  pain management and cognitive deficits  in addition to programs for neurologic  orthopedic  cardiac and pulmonary recovery 
as of december   we managed therapy programs in ltac hospitals 
we also provide ltac hospitals with clinical education and programming supported by our clinical experts in an effort to ensure that clinical practices support the provision of quality rehabilitation services in accordance with applicable standards of care 
sub acute units 
as of december   we managed sub acute or skilled nursing units 
these units provide lower intensity rehabilitation for medically complex patients 
patients diagnoses typically require long term care and cover approximately clinical conditions  including stroke  post surgical conditions  pulmonary disease  cancer  congestive heart failure  burns and wounds 
the hospital based sub acute unit enables patients to remain in a hospital setting where emergency needs can be met quickly as opposed to being sent to a freestanding skilled nursing facility 
these types of units are typically located within the acute care hospital and are separately licensed or under the hospital s license as permitted by applicable laws 
the hospital benefits by retaining patients who otherwise would be discharged to another setting  capturing additional revenue and utilizing idle space 
outpatient 
we also manage outpatient therapy programs that provide therapy services to patients with a variety of orthopedic and neurological conditions that may be related to work or sports injuries 
as of december   we managed hospital based and satellite outpatient therapy programs 
an outpatient therapy program complements the hospital s occupational medicine initiatives and allows therapy to be continued for patients discharged from inpatient rehabilitation facilities and medical surgical beds 
an outpatient therapy program also attracts patients into the hospital and is operated either on the hospital s campus or in satellite locations controlled by the hospital 
we believe our management of outpatient therapy programs enables the efficient delivery of therapy services through our scheduling  clinical protocol and outcome systems  as well as through time management training for our therapy personnel 
we also provide our customers with guidance on compliance and quality assurance objectives 
we typically are paid by outpatient therapy customers on the basis of a negotiated fee per unit of service

home health and hospice division our home health and hospice division provides home health  hospice and private duty services to patients in a variety of settings  including homes  skilled nursing facilities and other residential settings 
as of december   our home health and hospice division operated locations in eight states  employing approximately  caregivers to serve the needs of over  patients on a daily basis 
the division generated revenues of approximately million in our home health operations offer medical care and other services to patients in their homes or other residential settings 
experienced nurses  therapists and home health aides work with the patient and his or her family members to maximize the patient s ability to handle a wide variety of daily activities and to educate the patient regarding medications and medical conditions

governmental regulation various healthcare reform provisions became law upon enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act enacted on march  and the healthcare education and reconciliation act enacted on march  collectively  the aca 
the reforms contained in the aca will impact each of our businesses in some manner 
several of the reforms are very significant and could ultimately change the nature of our services  the methods of payment for our services and the underlying regulatory environment 
the reforms include possible modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment  bundling payments to cover both 
table of contents acute and post acute care and the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers 
the aca creates a series of robust transparency and reporting requirements for skilled nursing facilities including requirements to disclose information on organizational structures  financial  clinical and other related data as well as information on officers  directors  trustees or managing employees 
skilled nursing facilities are required to certify to the secretary of the us department of health and human services hhs and the us department of health and human services office of inspector general the oig that the information submitted is accurate and current 
in addition  the primary goals of healthcare reform are to increase quality and reduce costs 
the aca includes reductions in the reimbursement paid to us and other healthcare providers as well as additional reductions for failure to meet certain quality standards 
moreover  healthcare reform could negatively impact insurance companies  other third party payors  our customers  as well as other healthcare providers  which may in turn negatively impact our business 
as such  these healthcare reforms or other similar healthcare reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
medicare and medicaid medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age and over and certain disabled persons 
medicaid is a medical assistance program administered by each state funded with federal and state funds pursuant to which healthcare benefits are available to certain indigent or disabled patients 
within the medicare and medicaid statutory framework  there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings  interpretations and discretion that may affect payments made under medicare and medicaid 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from patients covered by the medicare and medicaid programs 
we could be affected adversely by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third party payors to contain healthcare costs 
we cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental and private third party payor programs  including medicare supplemental insurance policies  will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to these programs 
medicare reimbursement in ltac hospitals  irfs and nursing centers is subject to fixed payments under the medicare prospective payment systems 
in accordance with medicare laws  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms makes annual adjustments to medicare payment rates in many prospective payment systems under what is commonly known as a market basket update 
each year  the medicare payment advisory commission  a commission chartered by congress to advise it on medicare payment issues medpac  makes payment policy recommendations to congress for a variety of medicare payment systems 
congress is not obligated to adopt medpac recommendations  and  based upon outcomes in previous years  there can be no assurance that congress will adopt medpac s recommendations in a given year 
medicaid reimbursement rates in many states in which we operate nursing and rehabilitation centers also are based upon fixed payment systems 
generally  these rates are adjusted annually for inflation 
however  these adjustments may not reflect the actual increase in the costs of providing healthcare services 
in addition  medicaid reimbursement can be impacted negatively by state budgetary pressures  which may lead to reduced reimbursement or delays in receiving payments 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the facilities operated by us  or the provision of goods and services offered by us  will meet the requirements for participation in such programs 
healthcare reforms under the aca will affect each of our businesses and are directed in large part at cost reduction 
these changes could reduce the payments for our services and negatively impact insurance companies and other third party payors 
the reforms also include possible modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment  bundling payments to cover both acute and post acute care and enrollment limitations on new providers 
the aca includes reductions to the annual market basket payment updates for ltac hospitals and irfs  which could reduce the update to less than zero resulting in lower reimbursement than in the preceding year 
in addition to specific market basket reductions  the annual market basket payment update for ltac hospitals  irfs and nursing centers must be reduced for a productivity adjustment determined annually by cms that began being implemented on october  the aca also requires implementation of quality indicators 

table of contents the aca requires reductions to updates in the standard federal rate to ltac hospitals that began in the rate year and productivity adjustment reductions in updates to payments for ltac hospitals and nursing and rehabilitation centers beginning in fiscal year  which in each case may cause reimbursement to be less than in the prior year 
in addition  under the aca  beginning in fiscal year  medicare payments to hospitals  including ltac hospitals and irfs  will be reduced if the hospital fails to meet certain quality data or fails to comply with new value based purchasing demonstration project programs 
nursing and rehabilitation centers also will be subject to reductions in reimbursement beginning in fiscal year if they fail to meet the quality data reporting or standards in new value based purchasing demonstration project programs 
on july   cms issued final rules which  among other things  significantly reduced medicare payments to nursing centers and changed the reimbursement for the provision of group rehabilitation therapy services to medicare beneficiaries beginning october  the cms rules 
the cms rules impose a negative adjustment to rugs iv therapy rates  and a net market basket increase of consisting of a a market basket inflation increase  less b a adjustment to account for the effect of a productivity adjustment  beginning on october  cms has projected the impact of these changes will result in an decrease in payments to skilled nursing centers 
in addition to these rate changes  the cms rules introduced additional changes to rug calculations along with adding additional patient assessments 
under the cms rules  group therapy is defined as therapy sessions with four patients who are performing similar therapy activities 
in addition  for purposes of assigning patients to rugs iv payment categories  the minutes of group therapy are divided by four with of the minutes being allocated to each patient 
the cms rules also clarify the circumstances for reporting breaks in care of three or more days of therapy and also implement a new change of therapy assessment that is designed to allocate the patient to the rug level that represents the treatment provided in the last seven days 
both changes are likely to produce alterations in the rug scores billed for the patient along with generating additional patient assessments 
we believe that the cms rules could reduce our annual revenues by approximately million to million in our nursing center business and negatively impact our rehabilitation therapy business by approximately million to million on an annual basis 
the budget control act of  enacted on august   increased the united states debt ceiling in connection with deficit reductions over the next ten years 
the budget control act of also established a member joint committee of congress known as the joint select committee on deficit reduction 
the goal of the joint select committee on deficit reduction was to propose legislation to reduce the united states federal deficit by trillion for fiscal years to however  legislation was not enacted by the december  deadline  and therefore trillion in domestic and defense spending reductions will automatically begin february   split evenly between domestic and defense spending 
payments to medicare providers are subject to these automatic spending reductions  subject to a cap 
at this time  we believe this will result in an automatic reduction on each claim submitted to medicare beginning february  reductions to medicare and medicaid reimbursement resulting from the budget control act of could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we cannot predict the adjustments to medicare payment rates that congress or cms may make in the future 
congress  medpac  and cms will continue to address reimbursement rates for a variety of healthcare settings 
for example  the aca requires that cms establish new quality data reporting for all ltac hospitals and irfs to begin in fiscal year and failure to comply will result in a reduction of in the market basket update for the applicable fiscal year 
any downward adjustment to rates  or another pricing roll back  for the types of facilities we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  there are continuing efforts to reform governmental healthcare programs that could result in major changes in the healthcare delivery and reimbursement systems on a national and state level and we cannot 
table of contents assure you that healthcare reform  future healthcare legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental healthcare programs will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
see item a risk factors risk factors relating to reimbursement and regulation of our business changes in the reimbursement rates or methods or timing of payment from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs  or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursement for our services and products could result in a substantial reduction in our revenues and operating margins 
federal  state and local regulations the extensive federal  state and local regulations affecting the healthcare industry include  but are not limited to  regulations relating to licensure  conduct of operations  ownership of facilities  addition of facilities  allowable costs  services and prices for services  facility staffing requirements  and the privacy and security of health related information 
in addition  various anti fraud and abuse laws  including physician self referral laws  anti kickback laws and laws regarding filing of false claims  codified under the social security act and other statutes  prohibit certain business practices and relationships in connection with healthcare services for patients whose care will be paid by medicare  medicaid or other governmental programs 
sanctions for violating these anti fraud and abuse laws include criminal penalties  civil penalties and possible exclusion from government programs such as medicare and medicaid 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are subject regularly to inquiries  investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee applicable healthcare program participation and payment regulations 
audits may include enhanced medical necessity review of hospital cases pursuant to the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act of the schip extension act and audits under the cms recovery audit contractor rac program which was expanded pursuant to the tax relief and health care act of we believe that the regulatory environment surrounding most segments of the healthcare industry remains intense 
federal and state governments continue to impose intensive enforcement policies resulting in a significant number of inspections  citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory penalties including demands for refund of overpayments  terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs  bars on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions and civil monetary penalties 
these enforcement policies  along with the costs incurred to respond to and defend reviews  audits and investigations  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we vigorously contest such penalties where appropriate  however  these cases can involve significant legal and other expenses and consume our resources 
section of the social security act  commonly known as the stark law  provides that a physician may not refer a medicare or medicaid patient for a designated health service to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship unless the financial arrangement meets an exception under the stark law or its regulations 
designated health services include inpatient and outpatient hospital services  physical  occupational  and speech therapy  durable medical equipment  prosthetics  orthotics and supplies  diagnostic imaging  enteral and parenteral feeding and supplies  home health services  and clinical laboratory services 
under the stark law  a financial relationship is defined as an ownership or investment interest or a compensation arrangement 
if such a financial relationship exists and does not meet a stark law exception  the entity is prohibited from submitting or claiming payment under the medicare or medicaid programs or from collecting from the patient or other payor 
many of the compensation arrangements exceptions permit referrals if  among other things  the arrangement is set forth in a written agreement signed by the parties  the compensation to be paid is set in advance  is consistent with fair market value and is not determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or other business generated between the parties 
exceptions may have other requirements 
any funds collected for an item or service resulting from a referral that violates the stark law must be repaid to medicare or medicaid  any other third party payor and the patient 
in addition  a civil monetary penalty of up to  for each service may be imposed for presenting or 
table of contents causing to be presented  a claim for a service rendered in violation of the stark law 
many states have enacted healthcare provider referral laws that go beyond physician self referrals or apply to a greater range of services than just the designated health services under the stark law 
the anti kickback statute  section b of the social security act the anti kickback statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any remuneration  directly or indirectly  overtly or covertly  in cash or in kind  to induce the referral of an individual  in return for recommending  or to arrange for  the referral of an individual for any item or service payable under any federal healthcare program  including medicare or medicaid 
the oig has issued regulations that create safe harbors for certain conduct and business relationships that are deemed protected under the anti kickback statute 
in order to receive safe harbor protection  all of the requirements of a safe harbor must be met 
the fact that a given business arrangement does not fall within one of these safe harbors  however  does not render the arrangement per se illegal 
business arrangements of healthcare service providers that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria  if investigated  will be evaluated based upon all facts and circumstances and risk increased scrutiny and possible sanctions by enforcement authorities 
the anti kickback statute is a criminal statute  with penalties of up to  up to five years in prison  or both 
the oig can pursue a civil claim for violation of the anti kickback statute under the civil monetary penalty statute of up to  per claim and up to three times the amount received from the government for the items or services 
we believe that business practices of providers and financial relationships between providers have become subject to increased scrutiny as healthcare reform efforts continue on the federal and state levels 
state medicaid programs are required to enact an anti kickback statute 
many states have adopted or are considering similar legislative proposals  some of which extend beyond the medicaid program  to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients regardless of the source of payment for the care 
the us department of justice the doj may bring an action under the federal false claims act the fca  alleging that a healthcare provider has defrauded the government by submitting a claim for items or services not rendered as claimed  which may include coding errors  billing for services not provided and submitting false or erroneous cost reports 
the fraud enforcement and recovery act of expanded the scope of the fca by  among other things  creating liability for knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and broadening protections for whistleblowers 
the aca clarifies that if an item or service is provided in violation of the anti kickback statute  the claim submitted for those items or services is a false claim that may be prosecuted under the fca as a false claim 
civil penalties under the fca are between  and  for each claim and up to three times of the amount claimed 
under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the fca  a private individual with knowledge of fraud may bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and receive a percentage of the federal government s recovery 
due to these whistleblower incentives  lawsuits have become more frequent 
in addition to the penalties described above  violation of any of these laws may subject us to exclusion from participation in any federal or state healthcare program 
these fraud and abuse laws and regulations are complex  and we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations 
while we do not believe our arrangements are in violation of these prohibitions  we cannot assure you that governmental officials charged with the responsibility for enforcing the provisions of these prohibitions will not assert that one or more of our arrangements are in violation of the provisions of such laws and regulations 
the balanced budget act of the balanced budget act also includes a number of anti fraud and abuse provisions 
the balanced budget act contains additional civil monetary penalties for violations of the anti kickback statute discussed above and imposes an affirmative duty on healthcare providers to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the medicare program 
the balanced budget act also provides a minimum ten year period for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs for persons or entities convicted of a prior healthcare offense 

table of contents various states in which we operate hospitals and nursing and rehabilitation centers have established minimum staffing requirements or may establish minimum staffing requirements in the future 
the implementation of these staffing requirements in some states is not contingent upon any additional appropriation of state funds in any budget act or other statute 
our ability to satisfy such staffing requirements will depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified healthcare professionals  including nurses  certified nurse s assistants  therapists and other staff 
failure to comply with such minimum staffing requirements may result in the imposition of fines or other sanctions 
if states do not appropriate sufficient additional funds to pay for any additional operating costs resulting from such minimum staffing requirements  our profitability may be materially adversely affected 
the international classification of diseases icd is a classification system for diseases and signs  symptoms  abnormal findings  complaints  social circumstances and external causes of injury or diseases  promulgated by the world health organization 
hhs initially mandated that healthcare payors and providers and their vendors must convert from the current icd coding system to the materially different icd coding system by october  hhs subsequently announced its intent to delay the conversion date  but has not yet determined the new date by which conversion to icd must be completed 
icd is the first major change in diagnosis and procedure coding in three decades 
hipaa 
the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of  commonly known as hipaa  among other requirements  broadened the scope of existing fraud and abuse laws and mandated the adoption of administrative simplification regulations aimed at standardizing transaction formats and billing codes for documenting medical services  dealing with claims submissions and protecting the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information 
hipaa regulations that standardize transactions and code sets require standard formatting for healthcare providers  like us  that submit claims electronically 
the hipaa privacy regulations apply to protected health information  which is defined generally as individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained in any form or medium  excluding certain types of records such as education records 
the privacy regulations seek to limit the use and disclosure of most paper and oral communications  as well as those in electronic form  regarding an individual s past  present or future physical or mental health or condition  or relating to the provision of healthcare to the individual or payment for that healthcare  if the individual can or may be identified by such information 
hipaa provides for the imposition of civil and or criminal penalties if protected health information is improperly disclosed 
hipaa s security regulations require us to ensure the confidentiality  integrity  and availability of all electronically protected health information that we create  receive  maintain or transmit 
we must protect against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security of such information and the unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
the hipaa unique health identifier standards require us to obtain and use national provider identifiers 
the health information technology for economic and clinical health act  commonly known as the hitech act  was passed in and instituted new hipaa requirements regarding providing individuals with notification of breaches of their unsecured protected health information and reporting to the media of violations involving more than individuals in a single jurisdiction  as well as immediate reporting to hhs of any violation involving individuals or more for publication on the hhs website 
the hitech act also imposed new requirements on hipaa business associates and strengthened hipaa enforcement provisions  including civil monetary penalty amounts 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with the hipaa regulations 
we cannot assure you that potential non compliance by us with hipaa regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
certificates of need and state licensing 
certificate of need  or con  regulations control the development and expansion of healthcare services and facilities in certain states 
certain states also require regulatory approval 
table of contents prior to certain changes in ownership of a hospital or nursing center 
certain states that do not have con programs may have other laws or regulations that limit or restrict the development or expansion of healthcare facilities 
we operate hospitals in states and nursing and rehabilitation centers in states that require state approval for the expansion of our facilities and services under con programs 
to the extent that cons or other similar approvals are required for expansion of the operations of our hospitals or nursing and rehabilitation centers  either through facility acquisitions  expansion or provision of new services or other changes  such expansion could be affected adversely by the failure or inability to obtain the necessary approvals  changes in the standards applicable to such approvals or possible delays and expenses associated with obtaining such approvals 
we are required to obtain state licenses to operate each of our hospitals and nursing and rehabilitation centers and to ensure their participation in government programs 
some states require similar licenses for home health and hospice operations 
once a hospital or nursing and rehabilitation center becomes licensed and operational  it must continue to comply with federal  state and local licensing requirements in addition to local building and life safety codes 
all of our hospitals  nursing and rehabilitation centers and home health and hospice operations have the necessary licenses 
failure of our hospitals  nursing and rehabilitation centers and home health and hospice operations to satisfy applicable licensure and certification requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
hospital division general regulations 
the hospital division is subject to various federal and state regulations 
in order to receive medicare reimbursement  each hospital must meet the applicable conditions of participation set forth by hhs relating to the type of hospital  its equipment  personnel and standard of medical care  as well as comply with state and local laws and regulations 
we have developed a management system to facilitate our compliance with these various standards and requirements 
among other things  each hospital employs a person who is responsible for leading an ongoing quality assessment and improvement program 
hospitals undergo periodic on site medicare certification surveys  which generally are limited in frequency if the hospital is accredited by the joint commission or the aoa  national organizations that establish standards relating to the physical plant  administration  quality of patient care and operation of medical staffs of hospitals 
as of december   hospitals operated by the hospital division were certified as medicare ltac providers and five hospitals were certified as an irf provider 
in addition  hospitals also were certified by their respective state medicaid programs 
loss of certification could affect adversely a hospital s ability to receive payments from the medicare and medicaid programs 
as noted above  the hospital division also is subject to federal and state laws that govern financial and other arrangements between healthcare providers 
these laws prohibit  among other things  certain direct and indirect payments for the referral of patients  certain referrals by physicians if they or their immediate family members have a financial relationship with the hospital  or fee splitting arrangements between healthcare providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to  or the recommendation of  a particular provider for medical products and services 
such laws include the anti kickback statute  the stark law and the fca 
in addition  some states restrict certain business relationships between physicians and ancillary service providers and some states prohibit business corporations from providing  or holding themselves out as a provider of  medical care 
possible sanctions for violation of any of these restrictions or prohibitions include loss of licensure or eligibility to participate in reimbursement programs as well as civil and criminal penalties 
these laws vary considerably from state to state 
nine of our ltac hospitals are owned in part by physician investors 
under amendments to the stark law passed in the aca  the percentage of physician ownership in a hospital to which the physician investors refer medicare or medicaid patients may not increase and these hospitals may not expand their bed capacity or number of operating rooms or procedure rooms except for certain hospitals that meet stated requirements and receive permission from cms to expand under regulations that have not yet been published 

table of contents accreditation by the joint commission or the aoa 
hospitals may receive accreditation from the joint commission or the aoa 
with respect to accreditation by the joint commission  hospitals and certain other healthcare facilities are generally required to have been in operation at least four months in order to be eligible 
after conducting on site surveys  the joint commission awards accreditation for up to three years to hospitals found to be in substantial compliance with joint commission standards 
accredited hospitals also are periodically resurveyed  at the option of the joint commission  upon a major change in facilities or organization and after merger or consolidation 
with respect to the aoa  the accreditation process includes an in depth review of both open and closed patient records as well as on site surveys  including direct observation of the care being provided 
as of december   all of the ltac hospitals and irfs operated by the hospital division were accredited by either the joint commission or the aoa or were in the process of seeking accreditation 
the hospital division intends to seek and obtain joint commission or aoa accreditation for any additional hospitals it may operate in the future 
peer review 
federal regulations provide that admission to and utilization of hospitals by medicare and medicaid patients must be reviewed by peer review organizations or quality improvement organizations in order to ensure efficient utilization of hospitals and services 
a quality improvement organization may conduct such review either prospectively or retrospectively and may  as appropriate  recommend denial of payments for services provided to a patient 
the review is subject to administrative and judicial appeals 
each of the hospitals operated by our hospital division employs a clinical professional to administer the hospital s integrated quality assurance and improvement program 
denials by third party utilization review organizations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the hospital division s operating results 
overview of hospital division reimbursement medicare reimbursement of short term acute care hospitals medicare reimburses general short term acute care hospitals under a prospective payment system ipps 
under ipps  medicare inpatient costs are reimbursed based upon a fixed payment amount per discharge using medical severity diagnostic related groups ms drgs 
the ms drg payment under ipps is based upon the national average cost of treating a medicare patient s condition adjusted for regional wage variations 
although the average length of stay varies for each ms drg  we believe that the average stay for all medicare patients subject to ipps is approximately six days 
an additional outlier payment is made for patients with higher treatment costs but these payments are designed only to cover marginal costs 
hospitals that are certified by medicare as ltac hospitals and irfs are excluded from ipps 
medicare reimbursement of ltac hospitals since october  the medicare payment system for ltac hospitals has been based upon the long term acute care prospective payment system ltac pps  a prospective payment system specifically for ltac hospitals 
ltac pps maintains ltac hospitals as a distinct provider type  separate from short term acute care hospitals 
only providers certified as ltac hospitals may be paid under this system 
to maintain certification under ltac pps  the average length of stay of medicare patients must be greater than days 
as of january   medicare advantage patients will be included with medicare fee for service patients in order to determine compliance with the day average length of stay requirement 
cms has  for a number of years  considered the development of facility and patient certification criteria for ltac hospitals  potentially as an alternative to the current certification system pursuant to which ltac hospitals must maintain an average medicare length of stay of days 
in  medpac recommended to congress the adoption by cms of new facility staffing and services criteria and patient clinical characteristics and treatment requirements for ltac hospitals in order to ensure that only appropriate patients are admitted to these facilities 
since the medpac recommendation  cms has initiated studies to examine such recommendations and those studies are ongoing 
implementation of additional criteria that may limit the population of patients eligible for our hospital services or change the basis on which we are paid could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 

table of contents on august   cms issued final regulations regarding medicare hospital inpatient payments to short term acute care hospitals as well as certain provisions affecting ltac hospitals 
these regulations adopt a new system for ltac hospitals for classifying patients into diagnostic categories called medicare severity diagnosis related groups or more specifically  for ltac hospitals  ms ltc drgs 
ltac pps is based upon discharged based ms ltc drgs similar to the system used to pay short term acute care hospitals 
this new ms ltc drg system replaced the previous diagnostic related group system for ltac hospitals and became effective for discharges occurring on or after october  the ms ltc drg system created additional severity adjusted categories for most diagnoses 
while the clinical system which groups procedures and diagnoses is identical to the prospective payment system for short term acute care hospitals  ltac pps utilizes different rates and formulas 
three types of payments are used in this system a short stay outlier payment  which provides for patients whose length of stay is less than th of the geometric mean length of stay for that ms ltc drg  based upon the lesser of a per diem based upon the average payment for that ms ltc drg  the estimated costs  the full ms ltc drg payment  or a blend of an amount comparable to what would otherwise be paid under ipps computed as a per diem  capped at the full ipps ms drg comparable payment amount and a per diem based upon the average payment for that ms ltc drg under ltac pps  b ms ltc drg fixed payment  which provides a single payment for all patients with a given ms ltc drg  regardless of length of stay  cost of care or place of discharge  and c high cost outlier payment which provides a partial coverage of costs for patients whose cost of care far exceeds the ms ltc drg reimbursement 
for patients in the high cost outlier category  medicare will reimburse of the costs incurred above a threshold  defined as the ms ltc drg reimbursement plus a fixed loss amount per discharge 
on july   cms issued final regulations regarding the re weighting of ms ltc drgs for discharges occurring on or after october  cms announced that this update was made in a budget neutral manner  and that estimated aggregate ltac medicare payments would be unaffected by these regulations 
based upon our experience under these final regulations  it appears that the re weighting increased payments for the care of higher acuity patients 
on may   cms issued an interim final rule that revised the october  payment weights 
effective june   cms reduced ms ltc drg payment weights by  resulting in approximately a reduction of the estimated total ltac pps payments in the federal fiscal year ending september  no retroactive adjustments to payments were made 
on july   cms finalized this interim rule 
ltac pps provides for an adjustment for differences in area wages resulting from salary and benefit variations 
there also are additional rules for payment for patients who are transferred from a ltac hospital to another healthcare setting and are subsequently re admitted to the ltac hospital 
the ltac pps payment rates also are subject to annual adjustments 
medicare regulations require that when two or more hospital facilities share the same provider number and are considered to be a single hospital  the remote or satellite facility must meet certain criteria with respect to the main facility 
these criteria relate largely to demonstrating a high level of integration between the two facilities 
if the criteria are not met  each facility would need to meet all medicare requirements independently  including  for example  the minimum average length of patient stay for ltac hospital qualification 
it is advantageous for certain satellite facilities that may not independently be able to meet these medicare requirements to maintain provider based status so that they will be reimbursed at the higher rate for ltac hospitals under medicare 
if cms determines that facilities claiming to be provider based and being reimbursed accordingly do not meet the integration requirements of the regulations  cms may recover the amount of any excess reimbursements based upon that claimed status 
we have several hospitals in which multiple facilities share a medicare provider number  and the failure of any one or more of them to meet the provider based status regulations could materially and adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 

table of contents the ltac pps system is subject to significant change 
slight variations in patient acuity or length of stay could significantly change medicare revenues generated under ltac pps 
in addition  our ltac hospitals may not be able to appropriately adjust their operating costs to changes in patient acuity and length of stay or to changes in reimbursement rates 
in addition  we cannot assure you that ltac pps will not have a material adverse effect on revenues from commercial third party payors 
various factors  including a reduction in average length of stay  have negatively impacted revenues from commercial third party payors in recent years 
cms has regulations governing payments to ltac hospitals that are co located with another hospital  such as a hih 
the rules generally limit medicare payments to the hih if the medicare admissions to the hih from its co located hospital exceed of the total medicare discharges for the hih s cost reporting period  the percent rule 
there are limited exceptions for admissions from rural  urban single and msa dominant as defined below hospitals 
admissions that exceed this percent rule are paid using ipps 
patients transferred after they have reached the short term acute care outlier payment status are not counted toward the admission threshold 
patients admitted prior to meeting the admission threshold  as well as medicare patients admitted from a non co located hospital  are eligible for the full payment under ltac pps 
if the hih s admissions from the co located hospital exceed the limit in a cost reporting period  medicare will pay the lesser of the amount payable under ltac pps  or the amount payable under ipps 
at december   we operated hihs with  licensed beds 
on may   cms issued regulatory changes regarding medicare reimbursement for ltac hospitals the final rule 
in the final rule  the policy known as the percent rule was expanded to all ltac hospitals  regardless of whether they are co located with another hospital 
under the final rule  all ltac hospitals were to be paid ltac pps rates for admissions from a single referral source up to of aggregate medicare admissions 
patients reaching high cost outlier status in the short term hospital were not to be counted when computing the limit 
admissions beyond the threshold were to be paid at a lower amount based upon ipps rates 
however  as set forth below  the schip extension act initially placed a three year moratorium on the expansion of the percent rule to freestanding hospitals that was further extended by aca 
schip extension act 
the schip extension act became law on december  this legislation provides for  among other things a mandated study by the secretary of hhs on the establishment of ltac hospital certification criteria  enhanced medical necessity review of ltac hospital cases  a three year moratorium on the establishment of a ltac hospital or satellite facility  subject to exceptions for facilities under development  a three year moratorium on an increase in the number of licensed beds at a ltac hospital or satellite facility  subject to exceptions for states where there is only one other ltac hospital and upon request following the closure or decrease in the number of licensed beds at a ltac hospital within the state  a three year moratorium on the application of a one time budget neutrality adjustment to payment rates to ltac hospitals under ltac pps  a three year moratorium on very short stay outlier payment reductions to ltac hospitals initially implemented on may   a three year moratorium on the application of the so called percent rule to freestanding ltac hospitals  a three year period during which ltac hospitals that are co located with another hospital may admit up to of their patients from their co located hospital and still be paid according to ltac pps  
table of contents a three year period during which ltac hospitals that are co located with an urban single hospital or a hospital that generates more than of the medicare discharges in a metropolitan statistical area msa dominant hospital may admit up to of their patients from such urban single hospital or msa dominant hospital and still be paid according to ltac pps  and the elimination of the july  market basket increase in the standard federal payment rate of  effective for discharges occurring on or after april  the three year moratorium beginning on december  on the establishment and classification of new ltac hospitals  ltac satellite facilities and ltac beds in existing ltac hospitals or satellite hospitals does not apply to ltac hospitals that  before december   began the qualifying period for payment under ltac pps  had a written agreement with an unrelated party for the construction  renovation  lease or demolition for a ltac hospital and had expended at least of the estimated cost of the project or  or had obtained an approved certificate of need 
the moratorium also does not apply to an increase in beds in an existing hospital or satellite facility if the ltac hospital is located in a state where there is only one other ltac hospital and the ltac hospital requests an increase in beds following the closure or the decrease in the number of beds of the other ltac hospital 
the aca revised certain provisions of the schip extension act 
the moratoriums on the establishment of new ltac hospitals or satellites and bed increases at ltac hospitals or satellites  the application of a one time budget neutrality adjustment to rates  and the payment reductions due to the very short stay outlier provisions were extended from three years to five years 
this extension period will expire on december  the moratorium on the application of the percent rule to freestanding hospitals was extended from three to five years under the aca 
the moratorium on the percent rule threshold payment adjustment for freestanding hospitals and grandfathered hospitals with a host hospital will expire for cost reporting periods beginning on or after july  in addition  the schip extension act initially provided for a three year period during which ltac hospitals may admit up to of their patients from their co located hospitals and still be paid according to ltac pps  and ltac hospitals that are co located with an urban single hospital or a msa dominant hospital may admit up to of their patients from such urban single or msa dominant hospital and still be paid according to ltac pps 
those periods also were extended to five years under the aca 
the expansion of the admission limit to for non grandfathered ltac hospitals from their co located hospital will expire for cost reports beginning on or after october   the same time at which the limit for msa dominant hospitals will expire 
other recent medicare rate adjustments 
on july   cms issued final regulations regarding medicare reimbursement for ltac hospitals for the fiscal year beginning october  included in those final regulations is a market basket increase to the standard federal payment rate of  an offset of applied to the standard federal payment rate to account for the effect of documentation and coding changes  adjustments to area wage indexes  and a decrease in the high cost outlier threshold per discharge to  these final regulations also include a recalibration of the ms ltc drg payment weights 
cms indicated that all of these changes will result in a increase to average medicare payments to ltac hospitals 
the annualized reduction that resulted from a recalibration of ms ltc drg payment weights on june  is incorporated into the final october  payment weights 
on april   cms reduced the october  standard federal payment rate by as mandated by the aca 
in addition to specific market basket reductions  congress has mandated that the annual market basket payment update for a variety of providers  including ltac hospitals  be reduced for a productivity adjustment determined by cms 
these productivity adjustments may vary and will be determined annually by cms 
as discussed below  the productivity adjustments for ltac hospitals began being implemented on october  
table of contents on july   cms issued final regulations regarding medicare reimbursement for ltac hospitals for the fiscal year beginning october  included in those final regulations is a market basket increase to the standard federal payment rate of  an offset of applied to the standard federal payment rate to account for the effect of documentation and coding changes  an offset of applied to the standard federal payment rate as mandated by the aca  adjustments to area wage indexes  and an increase in the high cost outlier threshold per discharge to  cms indicated that all of these changes will result in a increase to average medicare payments to ltac hospitals

we believe that the impact of these proposed changes to ltac pps will result in an approximate increase in payments to our ltac hospitals 
beginning february   the budget control act of will automatically reduce federal spending by approximately trillion split evenly between domestic and defense spending 
payments to medicare providers are subject to these automatic spending reductions  subject to a cap 
at this time  we believe this will result in an automatic reduction on each claim submitted to medicare beginning february  reductions to medicare and medicaid reimbursement resulting from the budget control act of could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
on august   the long term care hospital improvement act of was introduced into the united states senate the ltac legislation 
if enacted  the ltac legislation would implement new patient and facility criteria for ltac hospitals and alleviate the negative impact of various scheduled medicare reimbursement adjustments 
the ltac legislation provides for patient criteria to ensure that ltac hospital patients are physician screened prior to admission and throughout their stay for the appropriateness of their stay in a ltac hospital 
in addition  facility criteria would establish common requirements for the programmatic  personnel and clinical operations of a ltac hospital 
the ltac legislation further provides that at least of patients must be medically complex in order for a hospital to maintain its medicare certification as a ltac hospital 
the ltac legislation also would repeal the percent rule for all ltac hospitals  the scheduled very short stay outlier payment reductions and the one time budget neutrality adjustment requirement 
there can be no assurances that the ltac legislation will be enacted in its current form or at all 
the aca requires a quality reporting system for ltac hospitals beginning in fiscal year under which any market basket update would be reduced by for any ltac hospital that does not meet the quality reporting standards 
the final regulations issued on august  include three quality reporting measures  catheter related infections associated with urinary tract infections and central line caused blood stream infections  and pressure ulcers 
cms also listed additional quality measures that it was considering for future adoption 
cms has indicated that data collection associated with these events could begin as early as october the ltac pps system is subject to significant change 
slight variations in patient acuity or length of stay could significantly change medicare revenues generated under ltac pps 
in addition  our hospitals may not be able to appropriately adjust their operating costs to changes in patient acuity and length of stay or to changes in reimbursement rates 
in addition  we cannot assure you that ltac pps will not have a material adverse effect on revenues from commercial third party payors 
various factors  including a reduction in average length of stay  have negatively impacted revenues from commercial third party payors in recent years 
in february  congress passed the middle class tax relief and job creation act of the job creation act of which provides for reductions in reimbursement of medicare bad debts at our hospitals 

table of contents commencing with cost reporting periods beginning on or after october   the rate of reimbursement for these bad debts will be reduced from to 
overview of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals reimbursement our irfs receive fixed payment reimbursement amounts per discharge under the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system irf pps based upon certain rehabilitation impairment categories established by hhs 
under the irf pps  cms is required to adjust the payment rates based upon a market basket index  known as the rehabilitation  psychiatric  and long term care hospital market basket 
the market basket update is designed to reflect changes over time in the prices of a mix of goods and services provided by rehabilitation hospitals and hospital based inpatient rehabilitation units 
over the last several years  changes in regulations governing inpatient rehabilitation reimbursement have created challenges for irf providers 
many of these changes have resulted in limitations on  and in some cases  reductions in  the levels of payments to irfs 
on may   cms issued a final rule  known as the rule  stipulating that to qualify as an irf under the medicare program a facility must show that a certain percentage of its patients are treated for at least one of a specified and limited list of medical conditions 
under the rule  any irf that failed to meet its requirements would be subject to prospective reclassification as an acute care hospital  with lower acute care payment rates for rehabilitative services 
the schip extension act reduced the compliance threshold to instead of and allowed hospitals to continue using a patient s secondary medical conditions  or comorbidities  to determine whether a patient qualifies for inpatient rehabilitative care under the rule 
the long term impact of the freeze at the compliance threshold is positive because it allowed patient volumes to stabilize 
in addition  the schip extension act included an elimination of the irf pps market basket adjustment for the period from april  through september  causing a reduction in medicare reimbursement 
on august   cms issued final regulations for medicare reimbursement for irfs 
the pricing changes were effective for medicare discharges between october  and september  and included a market basket update 
the aca reduced this market basket update to from april  through september  the coverage requirements  or specifications as to what conditions must be met to qualify for reimbursement under medicare  under this rule apply to discharges occurring on or after january  and include requirements for preadmission screening  post admission evaluations  and individual treatment planning that all delineate the role of physicians in ordering and overseeing patient care 
although these changes have not resulted in material modifications to our clinical or business models  they have resulted in significantly increased procedural and documentation requirements for all irfs 
in addition  due to the complexity of the changes within this rule  cms continues to clarify these revised coverage requirements 
on july   cms issued final regulations regarding medicare reimbursement for irfs for the fiscal year beginning on october  the pricing changes in this rule include a market basket update that has been reduced to under the requirements of the aca 
effective october   the aca also began implementing a productivity adjustment determined by cms to the market basket update on an annual basis 
on july   cms issued final regulations regarding medicare reimbursement for irfs for the fiscal year beginning october  included in these final regulations are a market basket increase to the standard payment conversion factor of  offsets to the standard payment conversion factor mandated by the aca of a to account for the effect of a productivity adjustment  and b as required by statute  a wage level budget neutrality factor of applied to the standard payment conversion factor  a case mix group budget neutrality factor of applied to the standard payment conversion factor  adjustments to area wage indexes  and a decrease in the high cost outlier threshold per discharge to  cms has projected the impact of these proposed changes will result in a increase to average medicare payments to irfs 
beginning february   the budget control act of will automatically reduce federal spending by approximately trillion split evenly between domestic and defense spending 
payments to medicare providers

similar to ltac hospitals  the aca requires a quality reporting system for irfs beginning in fiscal year in which any market basket update would be reduced by for any irf that does not meet quality reporting standards 
the final regulations issued on july  include two quality reporting measures  urinary catheter related infections and pressure ulcers  and cms indicated that it is still developing a day comprehensive all risk standardized readmission measure that is expected to be standardized in the near future 
cms also listed additional quality measures that it was considering for future adoption 
cms has indicated that data collection associated with these events could begin as early as october medicaid reimbursement of ltac hospitals and irfs the medicaid program is designed to provide medical assistance to individuals unable to afford care 
medicaid payments are made under a number of different systems  which include cost based reimbursement  prospective payment systems or programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals 
medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations of policy by state agencies and certain government funding limitations  all of which may increase or decrease the level of payments to our hospitals 
non government payments the hospital division seeks to maximize the number of non government payment patients admitted to its hospitals  including those covered under commercial insurance and managed care health plans 
non government payment patients typically have financial resources including insurance coverages to pay for their services and do not rely on government programs for support 
it is important to our business to establish relationships with commercial insurers  managed care health plans and other private payors and to maintain our reputation with such payors as a provider of quality patient care 
we negotiate contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services  including private employers  commercial insurers and managed care companies 
some payor organizations attempt to obtain discounts from established charges 
we focus on demonstrating to these payors how our services can provide them and their customers with the most viable pricing arrangements in circumstances where they may otherwise be faced with funding treatment at higher rates at other healthcare providers 
the importance of obtaining contracts with commercial insurers  managed care health plans and other private payors varies among markets  depending on such factors as the number of commercial payors and their relative market strength 
failure to obtain contracts with certain commercial insurers and managed care health plans or reductions in payments for our services provided to individuals covered by commercial insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
nursing center division general regulations 
the development and operation of nursing and rehabilitation centers and the provision of healthcare services are subject to federal  state and local laws relating to the adequacy of medical care  equipment  personnel  operating policies  fire prevention  rate setting and compliance with building codes and environmental laws 
nursing and rehabilitation centers are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to ensure continued compliance with various standards  continued licensing under state law  certification under the medicare and medicaid programs and continued participation in the veterans administration program 
the failure to obtain  maintain or renew any required regulatory approvals or licenses could adversely affect nursing center division operations including its financial results 
as noted above  the nursing center division also is subject to federal and state laws that govern financial and other arrangements between healthcare providers 
these laws prohibit  among other things  certain direct and indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between healthcare providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to  or the recommendation of  a particular provider for medical products and services and prohibit referrals from physicians that have certain financial relationships with the provider 
such 
table of contents laws include the anti kickback statute  the stark law and the fca 
in addition  some states restrict certain business relationships between physicians and ancillary service providers and some states prohibit business corporations from providing  or holding themselves out as a provider of  medical care 
possible sanctions for violation of any of these restrictions or prohibitions include loss of licensure or eligibility to participate in reimbursement programs as well as civil and criminal penalties 
these laws vary considerably from state to state 
in certain circumstances  federal law mandates that conviction for certain abusive or fraudulent behavior with respect to one nursing center may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to disqualification from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
in addition  some regulations provide that all nursing and rehabilitation centers under common control or ownership within a state are subject to being delicensed if any one or more of such facilities are delicensed 
licensure and requirements for participation 
the nursing and rehabilitation centers operated and managed by the nursing center division are licensed either on an annual or bi annual basis and generally are certified annually for participation in medicare and medicaid programs through various regulatory agencies that determine compliance with federal  state and local laws 
these legal requirements relate to compliance with the laws and regulations governing the operation of nursing and rehabilitation centers including the quality of nursing care  the qualifications of the administrative and nursing personnel  and the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment 
federal regulations determine the survey process for nursing and rehabilitation centers that is followed by state survey agencies 
the state survey agencies recommend to cms the imposition of federal sanctions and impose state sanctions on facilities for noncompliance with certain requirements 
available sanctions include  but are not limited to  imposition of civil monetary penalties  temporary suspension of payment for new admissions  appointment of a temporary manager  suspension of payment for eligible patients and suspension or decertification from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
we believe that substantially all of our nursing and rehabilitation centers are in substantial compliance with applicable medicare and medicaid requirements of participation 
in the ordinary course of business  however  our nursing and rehabilitation centers periodically receive statements of deficiencies from regulatory agencies 
in response  the nursing and rehabilitation centers implement plans of correction to address the alleged deficiencies 
in most instances  the regulatory agency accepts the nursing and rehabilitation center s plan of correction and places the nursing and rehabilitation center back into compliance with regulatory requirements 
in some cases  the regulatory agency may take a number of adverse actions against a nursing and rehabilitation center  including the imposition of fines  temporary suspension of payment for admission of new residents to the nursing and rehabilitation center  decertification from participation in the medicaid and or medicare programs and  in extreme circumstances  revocation of the nursing and rehabilitation center s license 
overview of nursing center division reimbursement medicare the medicare part a program provides reimbursement for extended care services furnished to medicare beneficiaries who are admitted to nursing and rehabilitation centers after at least a three day stay in an acute care hospital 
covered services include supervised nursing care  room and board  social services  physical  speech and occupational therapies  certain pharmaceuticals and supplies and other necessary services provided by nursing and rehabilitation centers 
medicare payments to our nursing and rehabilitation centers are based upon certain resource utilization grouping rug payment rates developed by cms that provide various levels of reimbursement based upon patient acuity 
the balanced budget act established a medicare prospective payment system pps for nursing centers for cost reporting periods beginning on or after july  the payments received under pps cover substantially all services for medicare residents including all ancillary services  such as respiratory therapy  physical therapy  occupational therapy  speech therapy and certain covered pharmaceuticals 
medicare part b provides reimbursement for certain physician services  limited drug coverage and other outpatient services  such as therapy and other services  outside of a medicare part a covered patient stay 
payment for these services is determined according to the medicare physician fee schedule mpfs 
annually 
table of contents since  the mpfs has been subject to a sustainable growth rate adjustment sgr intended to keep spending growth in line with allowable spending 
each year since the sgr was enacted  this adjustment produced a scheduled negative update to payment for physicians  therapists and other healthcare providers paid under the mpfs 
annually  since  congress has stepped in with so called doc fix legislation to stop payment cuts to physicians 
in december  congress passed the medicare and medicaid extenders act of mmea which suspended the payment cut for in december  congress passed the temporary payroll tax cut continuation act of the payroll tax cut act which again suspended the payment cut until february  in february  congress passed the job creation act of which further suspended the payment cut until december  since  federal legislation has provided for an annual medicare part b outpatient therapy cap 
in succeeding years  cms increased the amount of the therapy cap 
legislation also was passed that required cms to implement a broad process for reviewing medically necessary therapy claims  creating an exception to the cap 
legislation has annually extended the medicare part b outpatient therapy cap exception process 
the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of  enacted on july   extended the therapy cap exception process from july  to december  the aca provided that the exception process remain in effect from january  through december  mmea extended the therapy cap exception process through december  the payroll tax cut act extended the therapy cap exception process through february  the job creation act of further extended the therapy cap exception process through december  patients in our facilities whose stay is not reimbursed by medicare must seek reimbursement for their therapy under medicare part b and are subject to the therapy cap 
on january   the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of medicare part d implemented a major expansion of the medicare program through the introduction of a prescription drug benefit 
under medicare part d  dual eligible patients have their outpatient prescription drug costs covered by this new medicare benefit  subject to certain limitations 
most of our nursing and rehabilitation center patients whose drug costs were previously covered by state medicaid programs are dual eligible patients who qualify for the medicare drug benefit 
accordingly  medicaid is no longer a primary payor for the pharmacy services provided to these residents 
recent medicare rate adjustments on july   cms issued final regulations regarding medicare reimbursement for nursing centers for the fiscal year beginning october  included in these regulations are a market basket increase to the federal payment rates of  updates to the wage indexes which adjust the federal payment  and a reduction in the rug indexes attributed to a cms forecast error in a prior year  resulting in a reduction in payments 
cms estimated that these changes will result in a net decrease in medicare payments to nursing and rehabilitation centers of 
in addition to specific market basket reductions  congress has mandated that the annual market basket payment update for a variety of providers  including nursing centers  be reduced for a productivity adjustment determined by cms 
these productivity adjustments may vary and will be determined annually by cms 
the productivity adjustments for nursing centers began being implemented on october  on july   cms issued a notice that updates the payment rates for nursing centers for the fiscal year beginning october  that notice provided for an increase in rates of  which is comprised of a market basket increase of less a forecast error adjustment of 
in addition  for the fiscal year beginning october   cms increased the number of rug categories for nursing centers from to ie  rugs iv and amended the criteria  including the provision of therapy services  used to classify patients into these categories 
cms indicated that these changes would be enacted in a budget neutral manner 
cms began paying claims using the rugs iv system effective october  based upon our experience  these final regulations resulted in increased payments to the company for the federal fiscal year ending september  under rugs iv  among other requirements  providers must allocate therapy minutes among the patients being served during concurrent therapy sessions  and a therapist assistant may treat concurrently only two patients 
these changes have required us to employ more therapists to provide additional individual therapy minutes 

table of contents effective january   reimbursement rates for medicare part b therapy services included in the mpfs were reduced for secondary procedures when multiple therapy services are provided on the same day 
cms projected that the rule would result in an approximate rate reduction for medicare part b therapy services in calendar year we estimate that this rule reduced our medicare revenues related to part b therapy services by approximately million for the therapy time requirements to qualify for rehabilitation rug categories are unchanged under rugs iv  however the regulatory changes altered how minutes were allocated to calculate the rugs scores using the most recent clinical assessment tool of the minimum data set mds 
rather than count all therapy time that a nursing center patient receives  rehabilitation providers must now allocate therapy minutes between the patients being served during concurrent therapy sessions 
in addition  the number of patients that a therapist assistant may treat concurrently is limited to two patients 
under the cms rules  group therapy is defined as therapy sessions with four patients who are performing similar therapy activities 
irrespective of the number of patients ultimately treated in a group therapy session  rehabilitation providers must allocate therapy minutes during such sessions as if four patients are being served 
our rehabilitation division has hired additional therapists to facilitate the provision of additional individual minutes to address patient needs 
cms issued the cms rules on july  updating medicare payment rates for skilled nursing centers effective october  the cms rules impose a negative adjustment to rugs iv therapy rates  and a net market basket increase of consisting of a a market basket inflation increase  less b a adjustment to account for the effect of a productivity adjustment  beginning on october  cms has projected the impact of these changes will result in an decrease in payments to skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers 
in addition to these rate changes  the cms rules introduced additional changes to rug calculations along with adding additional patient assessments 
under the cms rules  group therapy is defined as therapy sessions with four patients who are performing similar therapy activities 
in addition  for purposes of assigning patients to rugs iv payment categories  the minutes of group therapy are divided by four with of the minutes being allocated to each patient 
the cms rules also clarify the circumstances for reporting breaks in care of three or more days of therapy and also implement a new change of therapy assessment that is designed to allocate the patient to the rug level that represents the treatment provided in the last seven days 
both changes are likely to produce alterations in the rug scores billed for the patient along with generating additional patient assessments 
we believe that the cms rules could reduce our annual revenues by approximately million to million in our nursing center business and negatively impact our rehabilitation therapy business by approximately million to million on an annual basis 
beginning february   the budget control act of will automatically reduce federal spending by approximately trillion split evenly between domestic and defense spending 
payments to medicare providers are subject to these automatic spending reductions  subject to a cap 
at this time  we believe this will result in an automatic reduction on each claim submitted to medicare beginning february  reductions to medicare and medicaid reimbursement resulting from the budget control act of could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
in february  congress passed the job creation act of which provides for reductions in reimbursement of medicare bad debts at our nursing and rehabilitation centers 
the job creation act of provides for a phase in of the reduction in the rate of reimbursement for bad debts of patients that are dually eligible for medicare and medicaid 
the rate of reimbursement will be reduced from to  then and then for cost reporting periods beginning on or after october   october   and october   respectively 
the rate of reimbursement for patients not dually eligible for both medicare and medicaid will be reduced from to  effective with cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  approximately of our medicare bad debt reimbursements are associated with patients that are dually eligible 

table of contents medicaid medicaid is a state administered program financed by state funds and matching federal funds 
the program provides for medical assistance to the indigent and certain other eligible persons 
although administered under broad federal regulations  states are given flexibility to construct programs and payment methods consistent with their individual goals 
accordingly  these programs differ in many respects from state to state 
the nursing center division provides to eligible individuals medicaid covered services consisting of nursing care  room and board and social services 
in addition  states may at their option cover other services such as physical  occupational and speech therapies and pharmaceuticals 
medicaid programs also are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations of policy by the state agencies and certain government funding limitations  all of which may materially increase or decrease the level of program payments to nursing and rehabilitation centers operated by the nursing center division 
we believe that the payments under many of these programs may not be sufficient on an overall basis to cover the costs of serving certain patients participating in these programs 
in addition  the downturn in the united states economy over the past few years has accentuated budgetary pressures impacting state fiscal budgets  thereby further reducing medicaid payments to our nursing and rehabilitation centers from current levels 
under the american recovery reinvestment act of  state medicaid programs were granted a temporary increase in federal medical assistance percentage fmap funding 
as a result of the economic downturn experienced by most states  the practical effect of the increase in fmap funding meant the payments for services in nursing and rehabilitation centers in most states were either frozen or increased nominally relative to annual adjustments normally associated with the medicaid budget process 
after various legislative extensions  the enhanced fmap rate expired june  as a result  state medicaid programs will have less federal funds to support the payments for our services 
there continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals that would impose further limitations on government and private payments to providers of healthcare services 
the balanced budget act eased existing impediments on the ability of states to reduce their medicaid reimbursement levels 
many states are considering or have enacted measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures and to make certain changes to private healthcare insurance 
as states face budgetary issues  we anticipate further pressure on medicaid rates that could negatively impact payments to our nursing and rehabilitation centers 
in addition  some states seek to increase the levels of funding contributed by the federal government to their medicaid programs through a mechanism known as a provider tax 
under these programs  states levy a tax on healthcare providers  which increases the amount of state revenue available to expend on the medicaid program 
this increase in program revenues increases the payment made by the federal government to the state in the form of matching funds 
consequently  the state then has more funds available to support medicaid rates for providers of medicaid covered services 
however  states may not necessarily use these funds to increase payments to nursing center providers 
provider tax plans are subject to approval by the federal government and were included as a provision in the tax relief and health care act of  codifying the maximum medicaid provider tax rate at through fiscal year effective october   the maximum medicaid provider tax rate was restored to 
although these plans have been approved in the past  we cannot assure you that such plans will be approved by the federal government in the future 
non government payments the nursing center division seeks to maximize the number of non government payment residents admitted to our nursing and rehabilitation centers  including those covered under private insurance and managed care health plans 
non government payment residents typically have financial resources including insurance coverages to pay for their services and do not rely on government programs for support 
it is important to our business to establish relationships with commercial insurers  managed care health plans and other private payors and to maintain our reputation with such payors as a provider of quality patient and resident care 
we negotiate contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services  including private employers  commercial insurers and managed care companies 
most payor organizations attempt to obtain discounts from established charges 
we focus on demonstrating to these payors how our services can provide them and their customers with the most viable pricing arrangements in circumstances where they may otherwise be faced with funding treatment at higher rates at other healthcare providers 
the importance 
table of contents of obtaining contracts with commercial insurers  managed care health plans and other private payors varies among markets  depending on such factors as the number of commercial payors and their relative market strength 
failure to obtain contracts with certain commercial insurers and managed care health plans or reductions in payments for our services provided to individuals covered by commercial insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
rehabilitation division general regulations 
the rehabilitation division is subject to various federal and state regulations 
therapists and other healthcare professionals that we employ are required to be individually licensed or certified pursuant to applicable state and federal laws 
we have processes in place in an effort to ensure that our therapists and other healthcare professionals are licensed or certified in accordance with applicable federal and state laws 
in addition  we require our therapists and other employees to participate in continuing education programs 
the failure of a therapist or other healthcare professional to obtain  maintain or renew required licenses or certifications could adversely affect a customer s and our operations  including negatively impacting our financial results 
as noted above  the rehabilitation division is subject to federal and state laws that govern financial and other arrangements between healthcare providers 
these laws prohibit  among other things  certain direct and indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between healthcare providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to  or the recommendation of  a particular provider for medical products and services 
such laws include the anti kickback statute  the stark law and the fca discussed previously 
in addition  some states restrict certain business relationships between physicians and ancillary service providers 
some states also prohibit for profit corporations from providing rehabilitation services through therapists who are directly employed by the corporation or otherwise providing  or holding themselves out as a provider of  clinical care 
possible sanctions for violation of any of these restrictions or prohibitions include loss of eligibility to contract with long term care facilities  hospitals and other providers participating in medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs as well as civil and criminal penalties 
these laws vary considerably from state to state 
overview of rehabilitation division revenues the rehabilitation division receives payment for the rehabilitation and program management services it provides to residents  patients and customers 
the basis for payment varies depending upon the type of service provided 
customers in the srs segment generally pay on the basis of a negotiated patient per diem rate or a negotiated fee schedule based upon the type of service rendered 
in the hrs segment  our hospital based inpatient rehabilitation unit customers generally pay on the basis of a negotiated fee per month or fee per discharge 
our ltac hospital customers pay based upon a negotiated per patient day rate 
our sub acute rehabilitation customers pay based upon a flat monthly fee or a negotiated fee per patient day 
our outpatient therapy clients typically pay us on the basis of a negotiated fee per unit of service 
as noted above  various federal and state laws and regulations govern reimbursement to nursing centers  hospitals and other healthcare providers participating in medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs 
though these laws and regulations are generally not directly applicable to our rehabilitation division  they are applicable to our customers 
if our customers fail to comply with these laws and regulations they could be subject to possible sanctions  including loss of licensure or eligibility to participate in reimbursement programs as well as civil and criminal penalties  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
if our arrangements with our customers are found to violate the anti kickback statute or other fraud and abuse laws  we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties as well as exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs 
in addition  there continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals to contain healthcare costs by imposing further limitations on government and private payments to providers of healthcare services 
medicare part b provides reimbursement for certain physician services  limited drug coverage and other outpatient services  such as therapy and other services  outside of a medicare part a covered patient stay 

table of contents payment for these services is determined according to the mpfs 
annually since  the mpfs has been subject to the sgr  intended to keep spending growth in line with allowable spending 
each year since the sgr was enacted  this adjustment produced a scheduled negative update to payment for physicians  therapists and other healthcare providers paid under the mpfs 
annually  since  congress has stepped in with so called doc fix legislation to stop payment cuts to physicians 
in december  congress passed mmea which suspended the payment cut for in december  congress passed the payroll tax cut act which again suspended the payment cut until february  in february  congress passed the job creation act of which further suspended the payment cut until december  since  federal legislation has provided for an annual medicare part b outpatient therapy cap 
in succeeding years  cms subsequently increased the amount of the therapy cap 
legislation also was passed that required cms to implement a broad process for reviewing medically necessary therapy claims  creating an exception to the cap 
legislation has annually extended the medicare part b outpatient therapy cap exception process 
the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of  enacted on july   extended the therapy cap exception process from july  to december  the aca provided that the exception process remain in effect from january  through december  mmea extended the therapy cap exception process through december  the payroll tax cut act extended the therapy cap exception process through february  the job creation act of further extended the therapy cap exception process through december  patients in our facilities whose stay is not reimbursed by medicare must seek reimbursement for their therapy under medicare part b and are subject to the therapy cap 
effective january   reimbursement rates for medicare part b therapy services included in the mpfs were reduced for secondary procedures when multiple therapy services are provided on the same day 
cms projected that the rule would result in an approximate rate reduction for medicare part b therapy services in calendar year we estimate that this rule reduced our medicare revenues related to part b therapy services by approximately million for in addition  for the fiscal year beginning october   cms finalized provisions that increase the number of rug categories for nursing centers from to ie  rugs iv and amend the criteria  including the provision of therapy services  used to classify patients into these categories 
cms indicated that these changes would be enacted in a budget neutral manner 
effective october   cms began paying claims using the rugs iv system 
the therapy time requirements to qualify for rehabilitation rug categories are unchanged under rugs iv  however the regulatory changes altered how minutes were allocated to calculate the rugs scores using mds rather than count all therapy time that a nursing center patient receives  rehabilitation providers must now allocate therapy minutes between the patients being served during concurrent therapy sessions 
in addition  the number of patients that a therapist assistant may treat concurrently is limited to two patients

both changes are likely to produce alterations in the rug scores billed for the patient along with generating additional patient assessments 
we believe that the cms rules could reduce our annual revenues by approximately million to million in our nursing center business and negatively impact our rehabilitation therapy business by approximately million to million on an annual basis 
reductions in the reimbursement provided to our customers by medicare or medicaid could negatively impact the demand and price for our services  impair our ability to collect for our services from customers and could have a material adverse effect on our rehabilitation revenues and growth prospects 
although reductions or changes in reimbursement from governmental or third party payors and regulatory changes affecting our business represent one of the most significant challenges to our business  our operations are also affected by coverage rules and determinations 
medicare providers like us can be negatively affected by the adoption of coverage policies  either at the national or local level  that determine whether an item or service is covered and under what clinical circumstances it is considered to be reasonable  necessary  and appropriate 
current cms coverage rules require inpatient rehabilitation services to be ordered by a qualified rehabilitation physician and be coordinated by an interdisciplinary team 
the interdisciplinary team must meet weekly to review patient status and make any needed adjustments to the individualized plan of care 
qualified personnel must provide required rehabilitation nursing  physical therapy  occupational therapy  speech language pathology  social services  psychological services  and prosthetic and orthotic services 
cms has also noted that it is considering specific standards governing the use of group therapies 
for individual claims  medicare contractors make coverage determinations regarding medical necessity which can represent more restrictive interpretations of the cms coverage rules 
we cannot predict how future cms coverage rule interpretations or any new local coverage determinations will affect us 
home health and hospice division general regulations 
the home health and hospice division is subject to various federal and state regulations 
many states require the entity through which home health or hospice services are provided to obtain a license or certification from one or more state agencies 
in addition  of our home health and hospice agencies achieved and or maintain certification through the medicare deeming authority of one of the three private accreditation bodies the joint commission  the accreditation commission for health care  and the community health accreditation program 
the therapists and other healthcare professionals employed by the home health and hospice division are required to be individually licensed or certified pursuant to applicable state and federal laws 
we have processes in place to ensure that our home health and hospice providers and the therapists and other healthcare professionals that we employ are licensed or certified in accordance with applicable federal and state laws 
in addition  we require our therapists and other employees to participate in continuing education programs 
the failure to obtain  maintain or renew required licenses or certifications by our home health and hospice agencies or the therapists or other healthcare professionals employed by those agencies could cause a material adverse effect on the home health and hospice division s results of operations 
as noted above  the home health and hospice division also is subject to federal and state laws that govern financial and other arrangements between healthcare providers 
these laws prohibit  among other things  certain direct and indirect payments for the referral of patients  certain referrals by physicians if they or their immediate family members have a financial relationship with the home health or hospice agency  or fee splitting arrangements between healthcare providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to  or the recommendation of  a particular provider for medical products and services

these laws vary considerably from state to state 
overview of home health and hospice division reimbursement medicare home health 
to be eligible to receive medicare payments for home health services  a patient must be homebound cannot leave home without considerable or taxing effort  require periodic skilled nursing or physical or speech therapy services  and receive treatment under a plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a physician based upon a face to face encounter between the patient and the physician 
we receive a standard prospective payment for home health services provided over a base day period  or episode  of care 
there is no limit to the number of episodes a patient may receive as long as he or she remains medicare eligible 
the base episode payment is a flat rate subject to adjustment based upon differences in the expected needs of each patient 
the adjustment is determined by each patient s categorization into one of payment groups  known as home health resource groups  and the costliness of care for patients in each group relative to the average patient 
payment is further adjusted for differences in local prices using the hospital wage index 
the payment also is subject to retroactive adjustment in certain circumstances  including i an outlier adjustment if the patient s care was unusually costly  ii a utilization adjustment if the number of visits to the patient was less than five  iii a partial payment adjustment if the patient transferred to another provider during an episode  iv an adjustment based upon the level of required therapy services  and v an adjustment based upon the number of episodes of care  with episodes three and higher receiving an increased rate 
hospice 
to be eligible to receive hospice care under the medicare program  a patient must have a terminal illness  as certified by two physicians  with a life expectancy of six months or less 
the patient must affirmatively elect hospice treatment to the exclusion of other medicare benefits related to his or her condition 
we receive payment for our hospice services under medicare through a prospective payment system that pays an established payment rate for each day that we provide hospice services to a medicare eligible patient 
the rates we receive from medicare are subject to annual adjustments for inflation and vary based upon the geographic location of the provision of hospice services 
the rate also varies depending upon which of four established levels of care we provide to the medicare patient i routine home care  which is the default level paid for each day a patient is in the hospice program and does not receive one of the higher levels of care  ii general inpatient care  which is paid when a patient needs inpatient services for pain or symptom management for a brief period  iii continuous home care  which is home care provided during a crisis period when the patient requires intensive monitoring and nursing care  and iv respite care  which allows a patient to receive inpatient care for a short period to provide relief for the patient s family and other care givers from the demands of providing care for up to five consecutive days 
the medicare payments we receive for hospice care are subject to two caps 
first  there is the rule providing that if the number of inpatient care days furnished to medicare patients exceeds of the total days of hospice care measured during a month period ending october of each year provided to medicare patients  the excess is only eligible for the routine home care rate 
second  there is a cap based upon an overall average payment per medicare beneficiary 
any payments exceeding the cap must be refunded to medicare 
beginning february   the budget control act of will automatically reduce federal spending by approximately trillion split evenly between domestic and defense spending 
payments to medicare providers are subject to these automatic spending reductions  subject to a cap 
at this time  we believe this will result in an automatic reduction on each claim submitted to medicare beginning february  reductions to medicare and medicaid reimbursement resulting from the budget control act of could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 

table of contents medicaid medicaid reimburses home health and hospice providers for care provided to certain low income patients 
reimbursement varies from state to state and is based upon a number of different systems including cost based  prospective payment and negotiated rate systems

master lease agreements at december   we leased from ventas and its affiliates ltac hospitals and nursing and rehabilitation centers under four master lease agreements as amended  the master lease agreements and one ltac hospital under a separate lease agreement 
under the master lease agreements  ventas has a right to sever properties from the existing leases in order to create additional leases  a device adopted to facilitate its financing flexibility 
in such circumstances  our aggregate lease obligations remain unchanged 
term and renewals each master lease agreement includes land  buildings  structures and other improvements on the land  easements and similar appurtenances to the land and improvements  and permanently affixed equipment  machinery and other fixtures relating to the operation of the leased properties 
there are several bundles of leased properties under each master lease agreement  with each bundle containing approximately six to leased properties 
the master lease agreements require that we renew all or none of the facilities by specified renewal bundles

renewal group in  we entered into agreements with ventas to renew all of the facilities in group for an additional five years 
the current term for the group facilities expires on april  we may further extend the term of the group facilities for two additional five year renewal terms beyond the current renewal term at the greater of the then existing rental rate plus the then existing escalation amount per annum or the then fair market value rental rate 
upon any such renewal  the fair market value rental rate is determined through an appraisal procedure described in the master lease agreements 
potential renewal of group and group facilities as noted above  we have until april  to renew the group and group facilities 
we have announced that we intend to renew three renewal bundles containing nursing and rehabilitation centers and six ltac hospitals from the group and group facilities collectively  the renewal facilities 
the renewal facilities contain  licensed nursing and rehabilitation center beds and licensed hospital beds and generated revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  the current annual rent for the renewal facilities approximates million

the expiring facilities contain  licensed nursing and rehabilitation center beds and  licensed hospital beds and generated revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  the current annual rent for the expiring facilities approximates million 
we will continue to operate the expiring facilities and include the expiring facilities in our results from continuing operations through the expiration of the lease term in april we believe that the divesture of the expiring facilities could reduce our consolidated earnings per diluted share by to in  but will not otherwise materially impact our cash flows or financial position 
this estimate is based upon a number of assumptions  including our estimated impact of the recent and impending medicare reimbursement reductions for nursing centers and ltac hospitals and our ability to achieve overhead savings in connection with these divestitures 
conditions to effectiveness of renewals we may not extend the master lease agreements beyond the base term or any previously exercised renewal term if  at the time we seek such extension and at the time such extension takes effect  an event of default has occurred and is continuing or a medicare medicaid event of default as described below and or a licensed bed event of default as described below has occurred and is continuing with respect to three or more leased

rent appraisal process and our right to revoke such renewals on november   we provided ventas with a notice to renew the leases for nursing and rehabilitation centers and three ltac hospitals 
these facilities are grouped into two separate renewal bundles  one containing six nursing and rehabilitation centers and two ltac hospitals and the other containing seven nursing and rehabilitation centers and one ltac hospital 
under the master lease agreements  ventas initiated an appraisal process to establish a new fair market rental as defined in the master lease agreements fmr for one of these bundles containing six nursing and rehabilitation centers and two ltac hospitals 
under the appraisal process  an independent appraiser determines the fmr for this renewal bundle and each property within such renewal bundle 
once fmr is determined  the appraiser sends to both parties simultaneously the aggregate fmr for this renewal bundle and the fmr for each property within the bundle 
ventas  in its sole discretion  then determines whether to accept the appraised fmr for the renewal bundle in the aggregate or make no changes to the current base rent and contingent annual rent escalator for the renewal bundle 
if ventas selects the new fmr for a renewal bundle  then the new fmr would become effective on may  unless we elect to revoke our renewal as discussed below 
a final independent appraiser has been selected 
the independent appraiser will have until april  to complete its determination of fmr  including the contingent annual rent escalator 
ventas  in its sole discretion  is then permitted to determine with respect to the renewal bundle whether to accept the new fmr or retain the current base rent and contingent annual rent escalator 
since ventas has initiated the appraisal process for this renewal bundle  we may revoke the renewal only for that bundle  whether or not the independent appraiser has completed its determination of fmr 
our renewal revocation can be made at any time until the earlier of july  or days after the independent appraiser s report determining fmr has been completed 
the determination of fmr requires certain levels of subjectivity and judgment related to the many variables that may be considered under the circumstances 
as a result  it is important for investors to consider the possibility of a wide range of outcomes with respect to the appraisal process 
rental amounts and escalators each master lease agreement is commonly known as a triple net lease or an absolute net lease 
accordingly  in addition to rent  we are required to pay the following all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties  certain taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties other than taxes on the income of ventas and all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties

in the event a medicare medicaid event of default and or a licensed bed event of default occurs and is continuing a with respect to not more than two properties at the same time under a master lease agreement that covers or more properties and b with respect to not more than one property at the same time under a master lease agreement that covers to and including properties  ventas may not exercise termination or dispossession remedies against any property other than the property or properties to which the event of default relates 
thus  in the event medicare medicaid events of default and licensed bed events of default would occur and be continuing a with respect to one property under a master lease agreement that covers less than properties  b with respect to two or more properties at the same time under a master lease agreement that covers to and including properties  or c with respect to three or more properties at the same time under a master lease agreement that covers or more properties  then ventas would be entitled to exercise all rights and remedies available to it under the master lease agreements 
assignment and subletting except as noted below  the master lease agreements provide that we may not assign  sublease or otherwise transfer any leased property or any portion of a leased property as a whole or in substantial part  including by virtue of a change of control  without the consent of ventas  which may not be unreasonably withheld if the proposed assignee is a creditworthy entity with sufficient financial stability to satisfy its obligations under the related master lease agreement  has not less than four years experience in operating healthcare facilities for the purpose of the applicable facility s primary intended use  has a favorable business and operational reputation and character  and has all licenses  permits  approvals and authorizations to operate the facility and agrees to comply with the use restrictions in the related master lease agreement 
the obligation of ventas to consent to a subletting or assignment is subject to the reasonable approval rights of any mortgagee and or the lenders under its credit agreement 
we may sublease up to of each leased property for restaurants  gift shops and other stores or services customarily found in hospitals or nursing and rehabilitation centers without the consent of ventas  subject  however  to there being no material alteration in the character of the leased property or in the nature of the business conducted on such leased property 
in addition  each master lease agreement allows us to assign or sublease a without the consent of ventas  of the nursing and rehabilitation center facilities in each master lease agreement and b with ventas consent which consent will not be unreasonably withheld  delayed or conditioned  two hospitals in each master lease agreement  if either i the applicable regulatory authorities have threatened to revoke our medicaid or medicare certification or an authorization necessary to operate such leased property or ii we cannot profitably 
table of contents operate such leased property 
any such proposed assignee sublessee must satisfy the requirements listed above and it must have all licenses  permits  approvals and other authorizations required to operate the leased properties in accordance with the applicable permitted use 
with respect to any assignment or sublease made under this provision  ventas agrees to execute a nondisturbance and attornment agreement with such proposed assignee or subtenant 
upon any assignment or subletting  we will not be released from our obligations under the applicable master lease agreement 
subject to certain exclusions  we must pay to ventas of any consideration received by us on account of an assignment and in the case of existing subleases of sublease rent payments approximately equal to revenue net of specified allowed expenses attributable to a sublease  and specifically defined in the master lease agreements  provided that ventas s right to such payments will be subordinate to that of our lenders 
ventas will have the right to approve the purchaser at a foreclosure of one or more of our leasehold mortgages by our lenders 
such approval will not be unreasonably withheld so long as such purchaser is creditworthy  reputable and has four years experience in operating healthcare facilities 
any dispute regarding whether ventas has unreasonably withheld its consent to such purchaser will be subject to expedited arbitration 
additional information employees as of december   we had approximately  full time and  part time and per diem employees 
we had approximately  unionized employees at of our facilities as of december  the market for qualified nurses  therapists and other healthcare professionals is highly competitive 
we  like other healthcare providers  have experienced difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel such as nurses  certified nurse s assistants  nurse s aides  therapists and other providers of healthcare services 
our hospitals and nursing and rehabilitation centers are particularly dependent on nurses for patient care 
our rehabilitation division continues to seek qualified therapists to fill open positions 
the difficulty we have experienced in hiring and retaining qualified personnel has increased our average wage rates and may force us to increase our use of contract personnel 
we expect to continue to experience increases in our labor costs primarily due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel 
salaries  wages and benefits were approximately of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  our ability to manage labor costs will significantly affect our future operating results 
professional and general liability insurance our healthcare operations are primarily insured for professional and general liability risks by our wholly owned limited purpose insurance subsidiary  cornerstone insurance company cornerstone 
cornerstone insures initial losses up to specified coverage levels per occurrence 
on a per claim basis  coverages for losses in excess of those insured by cornerstone are maintained through unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers 
cornerstone insures all claims in all states up to a per occurrence limit without the benefit of any aggregate coverage limit through unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers  thereby increasing our financial risk 
we believe that our insurance is adequate in amount and coverage 
there can be no assurance that in the future such insurance will be available at a reasonable price or that we will be able to maintain adequate levels of professional and general liability insurance coverage

factors that may affect our plans or results include  without limitation the impact of healthcare reform  which will initiate significant reforms to the united states healthcare system  including potential material changes to the delivery of healthcare services and the reimbursement paid for such services by the government or other third party payors 
healthcare reform will impact each of our businesses in some manner 
due to the substantial regulatory changes that will need to be implemented by cms and others  and the numerous processes required to implement these reforms  we cannot predict which healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level  the timing of any such reforms  or the effect such reforms or any other future legislation or regulation will have on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity  the impact of the cms rules which significantly reduced medicare reimbursement to nursing centers and changed payments for the provision of group therapy services effective october   the impact of the budget control act of which will automatically reduce federal spending by approximately trillion split evenly between domestic and defense spending 
at this time  we believe this will result in an automatic reduction on each claim submitted to medicare beginning february   changes in the reimbursement rates or the methods or timing of payment from third party payors  including commercial payors and the medicare and medicaid programs  changes arising from and related to ltac pps  including potential changes in the medicare payment rules  medicare part d  and changes in medicare and medicaid reimbursements for our nursing and rehabilitation centers  irfs and home health and hospice operations  and the expiration of the medicare part b therapy cap exception process

risk factors relating to reimbursement and regulation of our business healthcare reform has initiated significant reforms to the united states healthcare system 
various healthcare reform provisions became law upon enactment of the aca 
the reforms contained in the aca will impact each of our businesses in some manner 
several of the reforms are very significant and could ultimately change the nature of our services  the methods of payment for our services and the underlying regulatory environment 
the reforms include possible modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment  bundling payments to cover both acute and post acute care and the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers 
the aca creates a series of robust transparency and reporting requirements for skilled nursing facilities including requirements to disclose information on organizational structures  financial  clinical and other related data as well as information on officers  directors  trustees or managing employees 
skilled nursing facilities are required to certify to hhs and the oig that the information submitted is accurate and current 
in addition  a primary goal of healthcare reform is to reduce costs  which includes reductions in the reimbursement paid to us and other healthcare providers 
moreover  healthcare reform could negatively impact insurance companies  other third party payors  our customers  as well as other healthcare providers  which may in turn negatively impact our business 
as such  these healthcare reforms or other similar healthcare reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
changes in the reimbursement rates or methods or timing of payment from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs  or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursement for our services and products could result in a substantial reduction in our revenues and operating margins 
we depend on reimbursement from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs  for substantially all of our revenues 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our total revenues before eliminations from the medicare and medicaid programs and the balance from other third party payors  such as commercial insurance companies  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and contracted providers 
the medicare and medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes 
see part i item business governmental regulation 
there are continuing efforts to reform governmental healthcare programs  both as part of the aca and otherwise  that could result in major changes in the healthcare delivery and reimbursement system on a national and state level 
potential reforms include changes directly impacting the government and private reimbursement systems for each of our businesses 
reforms or other changes to the payment systems  including modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment  bundling payments to cover both acute and post acute care or the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers  may be proposed or could be adopted by congress or cms in the future 

table of contents on july   cms issued the cms rules which  among other things  significantly reduced medicare payments to nursing centers and changed the reimbursement for the provision of group rehabilitation therapy services to medicare beneficiaries beginning october  cms has projected the impact of these changes will result in an decrease in payments to skilled nursing centers 
in addition to these rate changes  the cms rules introduced additional changes to rug calculations along with adding additional patient assessments 
under the cms rules  group therapy is defined as therapy sessions with four patients who are performing similar therapy activities 
in addition  for purposes of assigning patients to rugs iv payment categories  the minutes of group therapy are divided by four with of the minutes being allocated to each patient 
the cms rules also clarify the circumstances for reporting breaks in care of three or more days of therapy and also implement a new change of therapy assessment that is designed to allocate the patient to the rug level that represents the treatment provided in the last seven days 
both changes are likely to produce alterations in the rug scores billed for the patient along with generating additional patient assessments 
we believe that the cms rules could reduce our annual revenues by approximately million to million in our nursing center business and negatively impact our rehabilitation therapy business by approximately million to million on an annual basis 
beginning february   the budget control act of will automatically reduce federal spending by approximately trillion split evenly between domestic and defense spending 
payments to medicare providers are subject to these automatic spending reductions  subject to a cap 
at this time  we believe this will result in an automatic reduction on each claim submitted to medicare beginning february  reductions to medicare and medicaid reimbursement resulting from the budget control act of could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
moreover  weak economic conditions also could adversely affect the budgets of individual states and of the federal government 
this could result in attempts to reduce or eliminate payments for federal and state healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid  and could result in an increase in taxes and assessments on our activities 
in addition  private third party payors are continuing their efforts to control healthcare costs through direct contracts with healthcare providers  increased utilization review and greater enrollment in managed care programs and preferred provider organizations 
these private payors increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures and are requesting that healthcare providers assume more financial risk 
though we cannot predict what reform proposals will be adopted or finally implemented  healthcare reform and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity through  among other things  decreasing funds available for our services or increasing operating costs 
we could be affected adversely by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third party payors to contain healthcare costs 
we cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental and private third party payor programs  including medicare supplemental insurance policies  will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to these programs 
future changes in third party payor reimbursement rates or methods  including the medicare and medicaid programs  or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursement for our services and products could result in a material reduction in our revenues 
our operating margins continue to be under pressure because of deterioration in pricing flexibility  changes in payor mix  changes in length of stay and growth in operating expenses in excess of increases in payments by third party payors 
in addition  as a result of competitive pressures  our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to private patients or commercial payors remains limited 
these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
expiration of the moratorium imposed on certain federal regulations otherwise applicable to ltac hospitals  including hihs and satellite hospitals  will have an adverse effect on our future revenues and profitability 
the schip extension act  among other things  placed a three year moratorium beginning on december  on the application of a one time budget neutrality adjustment to payment rates to ltac hospitals under 
table of contents ltac pps  and the very short stay outlier payment reductions to ltac hospitals 
the aca extended this moratorium to five years 
the expiration of this moratorium on december  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
cms has regulations governing payments to ltac hospitals that are co located with another hospital  such as a hih 
the rules generally limit medicare payments to the hih if the medicare admissions to the hih from its co located hospital exceed of the total medicare discharges for the hih s cost reporting period 
there are limited exceptions for admissions from rural  urban single and msa dominant hospitals 
patients transferred after they have reached the short term acute care outlier payment status are not counted toward the admission threshold 
patients admitted prior to meeting the admission threshold  as well as medicare patients admitted from a non co located hospital  are eligible for the full payment under ltac pps 
if the hih s admissions from the co located hospital exceed the limit in a cost reporting period  medicare will pay the lesser of the amount payable under ltac pps or the amount payable under ipps 
on may   cms issued the final rule 
under the final rule  cms expanded the percent rule to all ltac hospitals  regardless of whether they are co located with another hospital 
under the final rule  all ltac hospitals were to be paid ltac pps rates for admissions from a single referral source up to of aggregate medicare admissions 
patients reaching high cost outlier status in the short term hospital were not to be counted when computing the limit 
admissions beyond the threshold are to be paid at a lower amount based upon ipps rates 
the schip extension act initially placed a three year moratorium on the expansion of the percent rule to freestanding hospitals 
that moratorium was extended to five years by the aca 
the moratorium on the percent rule threshold payment adjustment for freestanding hospitals and grandfathered hospitals with a host hospital will expire for cost reporting periods beginning on or after july  in addition  the schip extension act initially provided for a three year period during which ltac hospitals may admit up to of their patients from their co located hospitals and still be paid according to ltac pps  and ltac hospitals that are co located with an urban single hospital or a msa dominant hospital may admit up to of their patients from such urban single or msa dominant hospital and still be paid according to ltac pps 
those periods also were extended to five years under the aca 
the expansion of the admission limit to for non grandfathered ltac hospitals from their co located hospital will expire for cost reports beginning on or after october   the same time at which the limit for msa dominant hospitals will expire 
since these rules are complex and are based upon the volume of medicare admissions and the source of those admissions  we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on our future revenues or operations from these regulations 
if the percent rule is applied as currently written  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity when the moratorium expires 
future cost containment initiatives undertaken by third party payors may limit our revenues and profitability 
initiatives undertaken by major insurers and managed care companies to contain healthcare costs or to respond to healthcare reform could affect the profitability of our services 
these payors attempt to control healthcare costs by contracting with providers of healthcare to obtain services on a discounted basis 
we believe that this trend will continue and intensify and may further limit reimbursements for healthcare services 
if insurers or managed care companies from whom we receive substantial payments reduce the amounts they pay for services  our profit margins may decline  or we may lose patients if we choose not to renew our contracts with these insurers at lower rates 
these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 

table of contents further consolidation of managed care organizations and other third party payors may adversely affect our profits 
managed care organizations and other third party payors have continued to consolidate in order to enhance their ability to influence the delivery and cost structure of healthcare services 
consequently  the healthcare needs of a large percentage of the united states population are increasingly served by a smaller number of managed care organizations 
these organizations generally enter into service agreements with a limited number of providers for needed services 
in addition  third party payors  including managed care payors  increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures 
to the extent that these organizations terminate us as a preferred provider  engage our competitors as a preferred or exclusive provider or demand discounted fee structures  our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry  and changes in regulations  the enforcement thereof or violations of regulations may result in increased costs or sanctions that reduce our revenues and profitability 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are subject regularly to inquiries and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee applicable healthcare program participation and payment regulations 
we also have been subject to government investigations 
we believe that the regulatory environment surrounding most segments of the healthcare industry will remain intense 
the extensive federal  state and local regulations affecting the healthcare industry include  but are not limited to  regulations relating to licensure  conduct of operations  ownership of facilities  addition of facilities  allowable costs  services and prices for services  facility staffing requirements  qualifications and licensure of staff  environmental and occupational health and safety  and the confidentiality and security of health related information 
in particular  various laws including anti kickback  anti fraud and abuse amendments codified under the social security act prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under medicare and medicaid  including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by medicare or other governmental programs 
sanctions for violating the anti kickback  anti fraud and abuse amendments under the social security act include criminal penalties  civil sanctions  fines and possible exclusion from government programs such as medicare and medicaid 
see part i item business governmental regulation 
federal and state governments continue to pursue intensive enforcement policies resulting in a significant number of inspections  audits  citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory sanctions including demands for refund of overpayments  terminations from the medicare and medicaid programs  bans on medicare and medicaid payments for new admissions and civil monetary penalties or criminal penalties 
rac audits and other audits evaluating the medical necessity of services provided are expected to further intensify the regulatory environment surrounding the healthcare industry as third party firms engaged by cms commence extensive reviews of claims data and medical and other records to identify improper payments to healthcare providers under the medicare program 
if we fail to comply with the extensive laws  regulations and prohibitions applicable to our businesses  we could become ineligible to receive government program reimbursement  suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 
in addition  we could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to investigations  audits or other enforcement actions related to these laws  regulations or prohibitions 
furthermore  should we lose the licenses for one or more of our facilities as a result of regulatory action or otherwise  we could be in default under our master lease agreements  our new credit facilities and indenture governing the notes 
failure of our staff to satisfy applicable licensure requirements  or of our hospitals  irfs  nursing and rehabilitation centers  our rehabilitation operations  and home health and hospice operations  to satisfy applicable licensure and certification requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local regulation or legislation  including medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations  or the intensity of federal and state enforcement actions 

table of contents changes in the regulatory framework  including those associated with healthcare reform  and sanctions from various enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we face and are currently subject to reviews  audits and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies and other payors  and these reviews  audits and investigations could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business 
as a result of our participation in the medicare and medicaid programs  we face and are currently subject to various governmental reviews  audits and investigations to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations 
an increasing level of governmental and private resources is being devoted to the investigation of allegations of fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid programs  and federal and state regulatory authorities are taking an increasingly strict view of the requirements imposed on healthcare providers by the social security act  the medicare and medicaid programs and other applicable laws 
we are routinely subject to audits under various government programs  including the rac program  in which third party firms engaged by cms conduct extensive reviews of claims data and medical and other records to identify potential improper payments to healthcare providers under the medicare program 
in addition  we  like other nursing center operators  are subject to ongoing investigations by the oig into the billing of rehabilitation services provided to medicare patients and general compliance with conditions of participation with medicare and medicaid 
private pay sources also often reserve the right to conduct audits 
our costs to respond to and defend reviews  audits and investigations are significant and are likely to increase in the current enforcement environment 
in the past  some of these audits and investigations have required us to refund or retroactively adjust amounts that have been paid under the relevant program or from other payors 
we may be subject to similar obligations in the future 
moreover  an adverse review  audit or investigation could also result in other adverse consequences  particularly if the underlying conduct is found to be systemic 
these consequences include state or federal agencies imposing fines  penalties and other sanctions on us  loss of our right to participate in the medicare or medicaid programs or one or more third party payor networks  or damage to our reputation in various markets  which could adversely affect our ability to attract patients  residents and employees 
if they were to occur  these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we are subject to extensive and complex federal and state government laws and regulations which govern and restrict our relationships with physicians and other referral sources 
the anti kickback statute  the stark law  the fca and similar state laws materially restrict our relationships with physicians and other referral sources 
we have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our healthcare facilities  and these laws govern those relationships 
the oig has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices deemed protected from prosecution under the anti kickback statute 
while we endeavor to comply with the safe harbors  most of our current arrangements  including with physicians and other referral sources  may not qualify for safe harbor protection 
failure to qualify for a safe harbor does not mean the arrangement necessarily violates the anti kickback statute  but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny 
however  we cannot offer assurance that practices outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti kickback statute 
allegations of violations of the anti kickback statute may be brought under federal civil monetary penalty laws  which require a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws  including the anti kickback statute 
our financial relationships with referring physicians and their immediate family members must comply with the stark law by meeting an exception 
we attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the 
table of contents stark law  but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex  and we cannot provide assurance that every relationship complies fully with the stark law 
unlike the anti kickback statute  failure to meet an exception under the stark law results in a violation of the stark law  even if such violation is technical in nature 
additionally  if we violate the anti kickback statute or the stark law  or if we improperly bill for our services  we may be found to violate the fca  either under a suit brought by the government or by a private person under a qui tam  or whistleblower  lawsuit 
if we fail to comply with the anti kickback statute  the stark law  the fca or other applicable laws and regulations  we could be subjected to liabilities  including civil penalties including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities or healthcare activities  exclusion of one or more facilities or healthcare activities from participation in the medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs and  for violations of certain laws and regulations  and criminal penalties 
we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations 
in the future  different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  services  capital expenditure programs and operating expenses 
a determination that we have violated these laws  or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity  and our business reputation could suffer significantly 
in addition  other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level may be adopted that adversely affect our business 
if our ltac hospitals fail to maintain their certification as ltac hospitals  our profitability would decline 
if our ltac hospitals  satellite ltac facilities or hihs fail to meet or maintain the standards for certification as ltac hospitals  such as average minimum length of patient stay  they will receive payments under the prospective payment system applicable to general acute care hospitals rather than payment under the system applicable to ltac hospitals 
payments at rates applicable to general acute care hospitals would result in our ltac hospitals receiving less medicare reimbursement than they currently receive for patient services and our profitability would decline 
in addition  implementation of additional ltac hospital certification criteria and medical necessity reviews may limit the population of patients eligible for our services or change the basis upon which we are paid  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
implementation of additional patient or facility criteria for ltac hospitals that limit the population of patients eligible for our hospital services or change the basis upon which we are paid could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
cms has  for a number of years  considered the development of facility and patient certification criteria for ltac hospitals  potentially as an alternative to the current payment system under ltac pps 
in  medpac recommended to congress the adoption by cms of new facility staffing and services criteria and patient clinical characteristics and treatment requirements for ltac hospitals in order to ensure that only appropriate patients are admitted to these facilities 
since the medpac recommendation  cms has initiated studies to examine such recommendations and those studies are ongoing 
on august   the ltac legislation was introduced into the united states senate 
if enacted  the ltac legislation would implement new patient and facility criteria for ltac hospitals and alleviate the negative impact of various scheduled medicare reimbursement adjustments 
the ltac legislation provides for patient criteria to ensure that ltac hospital patients are physician screened prior to admission and throughout their stay for the appropriateness of their stay in a ltac hospital 
in addition  facility criteria would establish common requirements for the programmatic  personnel and clinical operations of a ltac hospital 
the ltac 
table of contents legislation further provides that at least of patients must be medically complex in order for a hospital to maintain its medicare certification as a ltac hospital 
the ltac legislation also would repeal the percent rule for all ltac hospitals  the scheduled very short stay outlier payment reductions and the one time budget neutrality adjustment requirement 
there can be no assurances that the ltac legislation will be enacted in its current form or at all 
implementation of additional criteria that may limit the population of patients eligible for our hospital services or change the basis upon which we are paid could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
the temporary moratorium on the medicare certification of new ltac hospitals and beds in existing ltac hospitals will limit our ability to increase ltac hospital bed capacity  expand into new areas or increase services in existing areas we serve 
the schip extension act imposed a three year moratorium beginning on december  on the establishment and classification of new ltac hospitals  ltac satellite facilities and ltac beds in existing ltac hospitals or satellite hospitals 
the aca extended this moratorium to five years 
this extension period will expire on december  the moratorium does not apply to ltac hospitals that  before december   began the qualifying period for payment under ltac pps  had a written agreement with an unrelated party for the construction  renovation  lease or demolition for a ltac hospital and had expended at least of the estimated cost of the project or  or had obtained an approved certificate of need 
the moratorium also does not apply to an increase in beds in an existing hospital or satellite facility if the ltac hospital is located in a state where there is only one other ltac hospital and the ltac hospital requests an increase in beds following the closure or the decrease in the number of beds of the other ltac hospital 
this moratorium may adversely affect our ability to increase ltac bed capacity  expand into new areas or increase bed capacity in existing markets that we serve 
healthcare reform and other regulations could adversely affect the liquidity of our customers  which could have an adverse effect on their ability to make timely payments to us for our products and services 
the aca and other laws and regulations that limit or restrict medicare and medicaid payments to our customers could adversely impact the liquidity of our customers  resulting in their inability to pay us  or to timely pay us  for our products and services 
in addition  if our customers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations they could be subject to possible sanctions  including loss of licensure or eligibility to participate in reimbursement programs as well as civil and criminal penalties 
these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
if we do not manage admissions in the irfs that we operate or manage in compliance with a threshold  reimbursement for services rendered by us in these facilities will be based upon less favorable rates 
irfs are subject to a requirement that or more of the patients admitted to the facilities have one or more of specific conditions in order to qualify for irf pps 
if that compliance threshold is not maintained  the irf will be reimbursed at the lower prospective payment system applicable to acute care hospitals 
that may lead to reduced revenue in the irfs that we operate or manage and also may lead customers of irfs to attempt to renegotiate the terms of their contracts or terminate their contracts  in either case adversely affecting the projected revenues and profitability we expect 
if we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information  we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties  which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business 
there are a number of federal and state laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information  including patient records  and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information 
in 
table of contents particular  the privacy rules under hipaa protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure  giving individuals the right to access  amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limiting most use and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose 
if we are found to be in violation of the privacy or security rules under hipaa or other federal or state laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information  we could be subject to sanctions and civil or criminal penalties  which could increase our liabilities  harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
risk factors relating to the rehabcare merger there are risks associated with our acquisition of rehabcare 
on june   we acquired rehabcare for cash and shares of our common stock 
while we acquired rehabcare because we believe the acquisition will be beneficial to us and our stockholders  there are risks associated with the acquisition  which include the issuance of our shares in the rehabcare merger resulted in dilution of the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders  and any economic benefits that we realize as a result of the acquisition may not be sufficient to offset the ownership dilution  the risks associated with our efforts to integrate the operations of rehabcare with our own and achieve the cost and other synergies we expect  the impact of our increased level of indebtedness after the rehabcare merger on our financial and operating flexibility  our future access to the credit markets and our funding costs  and the possibility that the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of investor perceptions about the terms  benefits or results of the rehabcare merger 
any of these and the other risks discussed below could jeopardize our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the rehabcare merger as and when planned  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our stock price  financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
we may not be able to successfully integrate rehabcare s operations with our own or realize the anticipated benefits of the rehabcare merger  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
we may not be able to successfully integrate rehabcare s operations with our own  and we may not realize all or any of the expected benefits of the rehabcare merger as and when planned 
the integration of rehabcare s operations with our own is complex  costly and time consuming 
it will require significant attention from senior management and will impose substantial demands on our operations and personnel  potentially diverting attention from other important pending projects 
the difficulties and risks associated with the integration of rehabcare include the possibility that we will fail to implement our business plans for the combined company  including as a result of new legislation or regulation in the healthcare industry that affects the timing or costs associated with the operations of the combined company or our integration plan  possible inconsistencies in the standards  controls  procedures  policies and compensation structures of the two companies  the increased scope and complexity of our operations  risks and limitations on our ability to consolidate corporate and administrative infrastructures of the two companies  the possibility that we may have failed to discover liabilities of rehabcare during our due diligence investigation as part of the acquisition for which we  as a successor owner  may be responsible  
table of contents obligations that we will have to joint venture partners and other counterparties of rehabcare that arise as result of the change in control of rehabcare  obligations that we will have to our lenders under the new credit facilities and the holders of the notes  including our obligations to comply with significant new financial covenants  and the possibility of unanticipated delays  costs or inefficiencies associated with the integration of rehabcare s operations with our own 
as a result of these difficulties and risks  we may not accomplish the integration of rehabcare s business smoothly  successfully or within our budgetary expectations and anticipated timetable 
accordingly  we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the rehabcare merger  such as increase in our scale  diversification  cash flows and operational efficiency and meaningful accretion to our diluted earnings per share 
we may be unable to realize anticipated cost synergies or may incur additional and or unexpected costs in order to realize them 
we expect to realize approximately million of cost savings in related to operating synergies associated with the rehabcare merger 
these operating synergies do not include the costs incurred to realize such operating synergies 
we may be unable to realize all of these cost synergies within the timeframe expected  or at all  and we may incur additional and or unexpected costs in order to realize them 
risk factors relating to our indebtedness our indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 
to complete the rehabcare merger we took on significant levels of new indebtedness 
as a result  we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   we had total indebtedness of approximately billion in addition to availability of approximately million subject to a borrowing base and after giving effect to approximately million of letters of credit outstanding on december  under the abl facility 
our substantial amount of indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  expose us to fluctuations in the interest rate environment because the interest rates under the new credit facilities are variable  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities 
our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations  which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations 
the terms of the new credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries  including restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  
table of contents create liens  consolidate or merge  sell assets  including capital stock of our subsidiaries  engage in transactions with our affiliates  create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries  pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem  repurchase or retire our capital stock or indebtedness  and make investments  loans  advances and acquisitions 
the terms of the new credit facilities also include certain additional restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries  including restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries ability to  among other things change the date on which our fiscal years or quarters end  engage in business other than relating to owning  operating or managing healthcare facilities  enter into sale and lease back transactions  modify certain agreements  make or incur capital expenditures  and hold cash and temporary cash investments outside of collateral accounts 
in addition  the new credit facilities require us to comply with financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities 
the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the new credit facilities or the indenture governing the notes 
our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness  including as a result of events beyond our control  could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness  including the new credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes  we may not be able to incur additional indebtedness under the new credit facilities and the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately 
we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as a going concern 
further  if we are unable to repay  refinance or restructure our secured debt  the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness 
in addition  any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument also could result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments or under the master lease agreements 
in addition  counterparties to some of our contracts material to our business may have the right to amend or terminate those contracts if we have an event of default or a declaration of acceleration under certain of our indebtedness  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we  including our subsidiaries  have the ability to incur substantially more indebtedness  including senior secured indebtedness  which could further increase the risks associated with our leverage 
subject to the restrictions in the new credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes  we  including our subsidiaries  have the ability to incur significant additional indebtedness 
as of december  we had million of senior secured indebtedness under the new credit facilities  we had million of senior unsecured indebtedness under the notes  we had approximately million subject to a borrowing base and after giving effect to approximately million of letters of credit outstanding on december  available for borrowing under the abl facility which  if borrowed  would be senior secured indebtedness  subject to our compliance with certain covenants and other conditions  we have the option to incur additional incremental term loans under the term loan facility or increase the asset based revolving credit facility commitments under the abl facility by up to an aggregate of million  which  if borrowed  would be senior secured indebtedness  and subject to our compliance with certain covenants and other conditions  we have the option to incur certain additional secured indebtedness and or additional unsecured indebtedness which would rank pari passu with the notes 
although the terms of the new credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes include restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions  and indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
if we incur significant additional indebtedness  the related risks that we face could increase 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to pay rents related to our leased properties and service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness  which may not be successful 
a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations is dedicated to the payment of rents related to our leased properties as well as principal and interest obligations on our outstanding indebtedness 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control  and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  business  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof  sell assets  reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  we may not be able to effect any of these actions  if necessary  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the terms of existing or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions 
our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time 
any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants  which could further restrict our business operations 
in addition  any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating  which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations  or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all  would have an adverse effect  which could be material  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents in addition  our master lease agreements and or our outstanding indebtedness require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our rent and interest obligations  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate activities  require us to pledge as collateral substantially all of our assets  require us to maintain a certain defined fixed coverage ratio above a specified level and a certain defined total indebtedness ratio below a specified level  thereby reducing our financial flexibility  require us to limit the amount of capital expenditures we can incur in any fiscal year and also limit the aggregate amount we can expend on acquisitions  and restrict our ability to discontinue the operation of any leased property despite its level of profitability and otherwise restrict our operational flexibility 
these provisions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to withstand competitive pressures or adverse economic conditions including adverse regulatory changes  could adversely affect our ability to make material acquisitions  obtain future financing or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise  and could increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business 
our failure to pay rent or otherwise comply with the provisions of any of our master lease agreements could materially adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we lease of our hospitals and of our nursing and rehabilitation centers from ventas under our master lease agreements 
our failure to pay the rent or otherwise comply with the provisions of any of our master lease agreements would result in an event of default under such master lease agreement and also could result in a default under the new credit facilities and  if repayment of the borrowings under the new credit facilities were accelerated  also under the indenture governing the notes 
upon an event of default  remedies available to ventas include  without limitation  terminating such master lease agreement  repossessing and reletting the leased properties and requiring us to remain liable for all obligations under such master lease agreement  including the difference between the rent under such master lease agreement and the rent payable as a result of reletting the leased properties  or requiring us to pay the net present value of the rent due for the balance of the term of such master lease agreement 
the exercise of such remedies would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
for additional information on the master lease agreements  see part i item business master lease agreements 
repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries own a significant portion of our assets and conduct a significant portion of our operations 
accordingly  repayment of our indebtedness is dependent  to a significant extent  on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us  by dividend  debt repayment or otherwise 
certain of our subsidiaries may not be able to  or may not be permitted to  make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness 
each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and  under certain circumstances  legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries 
in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries  we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness 

table of contents an increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability 
borrowings under the new credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 
interest rate changes will not affect our obligation for any debt incurred under the new credit facilities  but could affect the amount of our interest payments  and accordingly  our future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
pursuant to the terms of the new credit facilities  we have entered into an interest rate swap that fixes a portion of our interest rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility  however  any interest rate swaps we enter into do not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 
as a result  an increase in interest rates  whether because of an increase in market interest rates or an increase in our own cost of borrowing  would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could materially reduce our profitability 
for example  a change of one eighth percent in the interest rates for the new credit facilities would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately million 
risks factors relating to our capital and liquidity the condition of the financial markets  including volatility and weakness in the equity  capital and credit markets  could limit the availability and terms of debt and equity financing sources to fund the capital and liquidity requirements of our businesses 
financial markets experienced significant disruptions over the past few years 
these disruptions have impacted liquidity in the debt markets  making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and  in certain cases  significantly reducing the availability of certain types of debt financing 
despite the instability over the past few years within the financial markets nationally and globally  we have not experienced any individual lender limitations to extend credit under our new credit facilities 
however  the obligations of each of the lending institutions in the new credit facilities are separate and the availability of future borrowings under the new credit facilities could be impacted by further volatility and disruptions in the financial credit markets or other events 
we cannot assure you that a prolonged downturn in the credit markets or other circumstances will not impact our ability to access or to refinance the new credit facilities 
our inability to access or refinance the new credit facilities would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
the new credit facilities are collateralized by substantially all of our assets including certain owned real property and is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries 
the terms of the new credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes include financial covenants and certain other provisions that limit acquisitions and annual capital expenditures 
we were in compliance with the terms of the new credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes at december  however  a downturn in operating earnings or events beyond our control could impair our ability to comply with the covenants contained within the new credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes 
if we anticipated a potential financial or other covenant violation  however  we would seek relief from our lenders for the new credit facilities and the holders of the notes  which likely would include costs to us  and such relief may not be on terms as favorable as those in the new credit facilities or the notes  as applicable 
under these circumstances  there is also the potential that our lenders under the new credit facilities or the holders of the notes would not grant relief to us 
a default due to the violation of a financial or other covenant contained within the new credit facilities  the indenture governing the notes or the occurrence of an event of default under the master lease agreements could require us to immediately repay all amounts then outstanding under the new credit facilities and the notes 
if we have future capital needs that cannot be funded from operating cash flows  any future issuances of equity securities may dilute the value of our common stock and any additional issuances of debt may increase our leverage 
though we anticipate that the cash amounts generated internally  together with amounts available under the new credit facilities  will be sufficient to implement our business plan for the foreseeable future  we may need additional capital if a substantial acquisition or other growth opportunity becomes available or if unexpected events occur or opportunities arise 
we cannot assure you that additional capital will be available  or available on 
table of contents terms favorable to us 
if capital is not available  we may not be able to fund internal or external business expansion or respond to competitive pressures or other market conditions 
if available  we may obtain additional capital through the public or private sale of debt or equity securities 
however  our ability to access the public debt or equity capital markets  on terms favorable to us or at all  may be limited by further disruptions in these markets or other events 
if we sell equity securities  the transaction could be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
furthermore  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock 
if we incur additional debt  our leverage may increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
disruptions in the financial markets could negatively impact our investment portfolio 
the financial market disruptions over the past few years have impacted the value of equity investments  bonds and other securities 
we regularly hold cash in depository and money market accounts 
if the financial institutions holding or managing these accounts fail or experience other disruptions  we could lose a portion or all of our cash which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
in addition  we hold a substantial investment portfolio in our limited purpose insurance subsidiary 
investments held in our limited purpose insurance subsidiary consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  debt securities  equities and certificates of deposit that are held to satisfy the payment of claims and expenses related to professional liability and workers compensation risks 
our investment policy governing insurance subsidiary investments precludes the investment portfolio managers from selling any security at a loss without prior authorization from us 
the investment managers also limit the exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of investment 
we intend  and have the ability  to hold insurance subsidiary investments for a long duration without the necessity of selling securities to fund the underwriting needs of our insurance subsidiary 
this ability to hold securities allows sufficient time for recovery of temporary declines in the market value of equity securities and the par value of debt securities as of their stated maturity date 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will recover declines in the market value of our investments 
there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other than temporary impairments may be recorded in the future 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that declines in the market value of our investments will not require us to further capitalize our limited purpose insurance subsidiary or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
our stock price is volatile and fluctuations in our operating results  quarterly earnings and other factors may result in declines in the price of our common stock 
equity markets are prone to  and in the last few years have experienced  extreme price and volume fluctuations 
volatility over the past few years has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies  including us and other companies in the healthcare industry 
if we are unable to operate our businesses as profitably as we have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future  the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when it becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized 
in addition to our operating results  many economic and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock  including general economic conditions  quarterly variations in operating results  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  press releases or negative publicity relating to our competitors or us or relating to trends in healthcare  regulatory changes and adverse outcomes from litigation and government or regulatory investigations  
table of contents sales of stock by insiders  changes in our credit ratings  natural disasters  terrorist attacks and pandemics  and limitations on our ability to repurchase our common stock 
market volatility and declines in the price of our common stock could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain capital or complete acquisitions through the public or private sale or issuance of our equity securities 
in addition  security holders often institute class action litigation following periods of volatility in the price of a company s securities 
if the market value of our common stock experiences adverse fluctuations and we become a party to this type of litigation  regardless of the outcome  we could incur substantial legal costs and our management s attention could be diverted from the operation of our business  causing our business to decline 
risk factors relating to our operations acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances that we have made or may make in the future may use significant resources  may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities 
we intend to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions of  investments in  and strategic alliances with  ltac hospitals  irfs  nursing centers  rehabilitation operations  and home health and hospice operations  particularly where an acquisition may assist us in scaling our operations more rapidly and efficiently than internal growth 
acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures  debt incurrence  additional operating losses  amortization of certain intangible assets of acquired companies  dilutive issuances of equity securities and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances involve numerous risks 
these risks include limitations on our ability to identify acquisitions that meet our target criteria and limitations on our ability to complete such acquisitions on reasonable terms and valuations  limitations on our ability to access equity or capital to fund acquisitions  including difficulty in obtaining financing for acquisitions at a reasonable cost  or that such financing will not contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility or ability to access additional capital when needed  entry into markets or businesses in which we may have limited or no experience  difficulties integrating acquired operations  personnel and information systems  and in realizing projected efficiencies and cost savings  particularly in the case of significant acquisitions  diversion of management s time from existing operations  potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired companies  inaccurate assessment of assets and liabilities and exposure to undisclosed or unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies  including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws  inability to operate acquired facilities profitably or succeed in achieving improvements in their financial performance  and impairment of acquired goodwill and intangible assets 

table of contents we continue to seek acquisitions and other strategic opportunities for each of our businesses that may negatively impact our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we continue to seek acquisitions and other strategic opportunities for each of our businesses  particularly where an acquisition may assist us in scaling our operations more rapidly and efficiently than internal growth 
accordingly  we are often engaged in evaluating potential transactions and other strategic alternatives  some of which may be significant in size  and we engage in preliminary discussions that may result in one or more transactions 
although there is uncertainty that any of our discussions will result in definitive agreements or the timing of announcement or completion of any transaction  our business  short term and long term financial position  results of operations and liquidity may be impacted if we announce or complete any such transaction or if we incur substantial costs or other losses in connection with such transaction  whether or not it is completed 
moreover  although we intend to enter into transactions that enhance long term shareholder value  our ability to achieve this objective would be subject to integration risks  the ability to retain and attract key personnel  the ability to realize synergies and other risks  all of which would be more material with transactions of significant size 
in addition to acquisitions  we also may pursue strategic opportunities involving the construction of new hospitals or nursing and rehabilitation centers 
the construction of new facilities involves numerous risks  including construction delays  cost over runs  and the satisfaction of zoning and other regulatory requirements 
we may be unable to operate newly constructed facilities profitably and such facilities may involve significant cash expenditures  debt incurrence  additional operating losses  and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we operate of our facilities through joint ventures with unrelated parties 
we are the majority owner of each of those joint ventures 
we may enter into additional joint ventures with unrelated parties in the future to acquire  own or operate ltac hospitals  irfs  nursing and rehabilitation centers and or home health and hospice services 
we will typically seek to be the majority owner of any such new joint ventures 
while  as the majority owner  we typically control the day to to activities of these joint ventures  the joint venture agreements with our partners often include provisions reserving certain major actions for super majority approval 
such actions may include entering into a new business activity or ceasing an existing activity  taking on substantial debt  admitting new partners  and terminating the venture 
in addition  the joint venture agreements may restrict our ability to derive cash from the joint venture and affect our ability to transfer our interest in the joint venture 
we may be required to provide additional capital to a joint venture if our partner defaults on its capital obligations 
certain events or circumstances could result in the impairment of our assets or other charges  including  without limitation  impairments of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that result in material charges to earnings 
we regularly review the carrying value of certain long lived assets  finite lived intangible assets and indefinite lived intangible assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate an impairment or an adjustment to the amortization period may be necessary  such as when the market value of our common stock is below book equity value 
on an ongoing basis  we also evaluate  based upon the fair value of our reporting units  whether the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired 
if circumstances suggest that the recorded amounts of any of these assets cannot be recovered based upon estimated future cash flows  the carrying values of such assets are reduced to fair value 
if the carrying value of any of these assets is impaired  we may incur a material charge to earnings 
in the fourth quarter  we took an aggregate pretax impairment charge of million on the value of the certificates of need intangible assets of certain hospitals and co located nursing and rehabilitation centers in massachusetts 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  we also determined that pretax impairment charges aggregating million were necessary  which included million of goodwill and million of property and equipment 
these charges were directly 
table of contents related to the cms rules which significantly reduced medicare payments to our nursing centers and changed the reimbursement for group rehabilitation therapy services 
future adverse changes in the operating environment and related key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets or continued declines in the value of our common stock may result in future impairment charges for a portion or all of these assets 
moreover  the value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets could be negatively impacted by potential healthcare reforms 
any such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
we could experience significant increases to our operating costs due to shortages of qualified nurses  therapists and other healthcare professionals or union activity 
the market for qualified nurses  therapists and other healthcare professionals is highly competitive 
we  like other healthcare providers  have experienced difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel such as nurses  certified nurse s assistants  nurse s aides  therapists and other providers of healthcare services 
our hospitals  nursing and rehabilitation centers and home health and hospice operations are particularly dependent on nurses for patient care 
our rehabilitation division continues to seek qualified therapists to fill open positions 
the difficulty we have experienced in hiring and retaining qualified personnel has increased our average wage rates and may force us to increase our use of contract personnel 
in addition  healthcare providers are continuing to see an increase in the amount of union activity across the country 
at december   approximately  of the employees at of our facilities were unionized 
though we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by future union activity  there are continuing legislative proposals that could result in increased union activity 
we could experience an increase in labor and other costs from such union activity 
furthermore  we could experience a disruption of our operations if our employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage 
we expect to continue to experience increases in our labor costs primarily due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel 
salaries  wages and benefits were approximately of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  our ability to manage labor costs will significantly affect our future operating results 
we could experience significant legal actions  fines and increases in our operating costs if we fail to comply with state minimum staffing requirements 
various states in which we operate hospitals and nursing and rehabilitation centers have established minimum staffing requirements or may establish minimum staffing requirements in the future 
staffing requirements in some states is not contingent upon any additional appropriation of state funds in any budget act or other statute 
our ability to satisfy such staffing requirements will  among other things  depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified healthcare professionals 
while we seek to comply with all applicable staffing requirements  the regulations in this area are complex and we may experience compliance issues from time to time 
failure to comply with such minimum staffing requirements may result in one or more facilities failing to meet the conditions of participation under relevant federal and state healthcare programs and the imposition of fines or other sanctions 
private litigation involving these matters also has become more common  and certain of our facilities are the subject of litigation involving claims brought in that we did not meet relevant staffing requirements from time to time since moreover  a portion of the staffing costs we incur is funded by states through medicaid program appropriations or otherwise 
if states do not appropriate sufficient additional funds to pay for any additional operating costs resulting from such minimum staffing requirements  our profitability may be materially adversely affected 

table of contents if we lose our key management personnel  we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives 
our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to retain and motivate these individuals  including individuals who came to us through the rehabcare merger 
competition for these individuals is intense and there can be no assurance that we will retain our key officers and employees or that we can attract or retain other highly qualified individuals in the future 
if we lose the services of one or more of our key officers or employees  or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives and we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel 
if we lose key personnel  we may be unable to replace them with personnel of comparable experience  reputation in the industry or skills 
the loss of any of our key officers or employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity  as well as on the successful integration of rehabcare into our operations 
if we fail to attract patients and compete effectively with other healthcare providers or if our referral sources fail to view us as an attractive post acute healthcare provider  our revenues and profitability may decline 
the post acute healthcare services industry is highly competitive 
our hospitals face competition from healthcare providers that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals 
many competing hospitals are larger and more established than our hospitals 
we may experience increased competition from existing hospitals as well as hospitals converted  in whole or in part  to specialized care facilities 
our nursing and rehabilitation centers compete on a local and regional basis with other nursing centers and post acute healthcare providers 
some of our competitors operate newer facilities and may offer services not provided by us or are operated by entities having greater financial and other resources than us 
our rehabilitation and home health and hospice divisions compete with national  regional and local rehabilitation service providers within our markets 
several of these competitors may have greater financial and other resources than us  may be more established in the markets in which we compete and may be willing to provide services at lower prices 
we cannot assure you that increased competition in the future will not adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
in addition  we rely significantly on appropriate referrals from physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers in the communities in which we deliver our services to attract appropriate patients and residents 
our referral sources are not obligated to refer business to us and may refer business to other healthcare providers 
we believe many of our referral sources refer patients and residents to us as a result of the quality of our patient services and our efforts to establish and build a relationship with them 
if any of our facilities fail to achieve or maintain a reputation for providing high quality care  or are perceived to provide a lower quality of care than comparable facilities within the same geographic area  or customers of our rehabilitation therapy  home health and hospice services perceive that they could receive higher quality services from other providers  our ability to attract and retain patients and customers could be adversely affected 
we believe that the perception of our quality of care by potential residents or patients or their families seeking our services is influenced by a variety of factors  including physician and other healthcare professional referrals  community information and referral services  newspapers and other print and electronic media  results of patient surveys  recommendations from family and friends  and published quality care statistics compiled by cms or other industry data 
if we lose  or fail to maintain  existing relationships with our referral resources  fail to develop new relationships or if we are perceived by our referral sources for any reason as not providing high quality patient care  our patient volumes and the quality of our patient mix could suffer and our revenue and profitability could decline 

table of contents significant legal actions could subject us to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we incur significant costs to investigate and defend against a variety of claims  including professional liability  wage and hour  and minimum staffing claims  among others  particularly in our hospital and nursing and rehabilitation center operations 
in addition to large compensatory claims  plaintiffs attorneys increasingly are seeking  and have sometimes been successful in obtaining  significant fines and punitive damages and attorneys fees 
furthermore  there are continuing efforts to limit the ability of healthcare providers to utilize arbitration as a process to resolve these claims 
as a result of these factors  our defense costs and potential liability exposure are significant  unpredictable  and likely to increase 
we also are subject to lawsuits under the fca and comparable state laws for submitting fraudulent bills for services to the medicare and medicaid programs 
these lawsuits  which may be initiated by whistleblowers  can involve significant monetary damages  fines  attorneys fees and the award of bounties to private qui tam plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits and to the government programs 
we also are subject to payment obligations under contracts we enter into with our rehabilitation division customers to indemnify them against claim denials associated with our services 
while we are able to insure against certain of these costs and liabilities  such as our professional liability risks described below  we are not able to do so in many other cases 
in the absence of insurance proceeds  we must fund these costs and liabilities from operating cash flows  which can reduce our operating margins and our funds available for investment in our business  and otherwise limit our operating and financial flexibility 
we insure a substantial portion of our professional liability risks primarily through our limited purpose insurance subsidiary 
provisions for loss for our professional liability risks are based upon management s best available information including actuarially determined estimates 
the allowance for professional liability risks includes an estimate of the expected cost to settle reported claims and an amount  based upon past experiences  for losses incurred but not reported 
these liabilities are necessarily based upon estimates and  while management believes that the provision for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of  or less than  the amounts recorded 
changes in the number of professional liability claims and the cost to settle these claims significantly impact the allowance for professional liability risks 
a relatively small variance between our estimated and actual number of claims or average cost per claim could have a material impact  either favorable or unfavorable  on the adequacy of the allowance for professional liability risks 
differences between the ultimate claims costs and our historical provisions for loss and actuarial assumptions and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
our limited purpose insurance subsidiary insures initial losses up to specified coverage levels per occurrence and in the aggregate 
on a per claim basis  coverages for losses in excess of those insured by the limited purpose insurance subsidiary are maintained through unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers 
our limited purpose insurance subsidiary insures all claims in all states up to a per occurrence limit without the benefit of any aggregate coverage limit through unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers  thereby increasing our financial risk 
we maintain professional and general liability insurance in amounts and coverage that management believes are sufficient for our operations 
however  our insurance may not cover all claims against us or the full extent of our liability nor continue to be available at a reasonable cost 
moreover  the cost of insurance coverage maintained with unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers is costly and may continue to increase 
there can be no assurances that in the future insurance will be available at a reasonable price or that we will be able to maintain adequate levels of professional and general liability insurance coverage 
if we are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages that are uninsured  we may be exposed to substantial liabilities 
federal and state employment related laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business and subject us to significant back pay awards  fines and lawsuits 
our operations are subject to a variety of federal and state employment related laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  the us fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages  
table of contents overtime pay  compensable time  recordkeeping and other working conditions  the americans with disabilities act and similar state laws that provide civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment  public accommodations and other areas  the national labor relations act  regulations of the equal employment opportunity commission  regulations of the office of civil rights  regulations of state attorneys general  federal and state wage and hour laws  family leave mandates and a variety of similar laws enacted by the federal and state governments that govern these and other employment related matters 
accordingly  we are currently subject to employee related claims  lawsuits including class action lawsuits and administrative proceedings in connection with our operations  including  but not limited to  those related to wrongful discharge  discrimination or violations of equal employment or federal and state wage and hour laws 
because labor represents such a large portion of our operating costs  compliance with these evolving federal and state laws and regulations could substantially increase our cost of doing business while failure to do so could subject us to significant back pay awards  fines and lawsuits 
in addition  federal proposals to introduce a system of mandated health insurance and flexible work time and other similar initiatives could  if implemented  adversely affect our operations 
our failure to comply with federal and state employment related laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we have limited operational and strategic flexibility since we lease a substantial number of our facilities 
we lease a substantial number of our facilities from ventas and other third parties 
under our leases  we generally are required to operate continuously our leased properties as a provider of healthcare services 
in addition  these leases generally limit or restrict our ability to assign the lease to another party 
our failure to comply with these lease provisions would result in an event of default under the leases and subject us to material damages  including potential defaults under the new credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes 
given these restrictions  we may be forced to continue operating unprofitable facilities to avoid defaults under our leases 
see part i item business master lease agreements 
possible changes in the acuity of residents and patients as well as payor mix and payment methodologies may significantly affect our profitability 
the sources and amount of our revenues are determined by a number of factors  including the occupancy rates of our facilities  length of stay  the payor mix of residents and patients  rates of reimbursement among payors and patient acuity 
changes in patient acuity as well as payor mix among private pay  medicare and medicaid can significantly affect our profitability 
in particular  any significant decrease in our population of high acuity patients or any significant increase in our medicaid population could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity  especially if state medicaid programs continue to limit  or more aggressively seek limits on  reimbursement rates 
we may be unable to reduce costs to offset completely any decreases in our revenues 
reduced levels of occupancy in our facilities and reductions in reimbursements from medicare  medicaid or other payors would adversely impact our revenues and liquidity 
we may be unable to put in place corresponding reductions in costs in response to declines in census or other revenue shortfalls 
the inability to timely adjust our operations to address a decrease in our revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our payors and customers which in the future may cause us to make larger allowances for doubtful accounts or incur bad debt write offs 
due to weak economic conditions  recent medicare reimbursement reductions and other factors  commercial payors and customers may default on their payments to us and individual patients may default on co payments and deductibles for which they are responsible under the terms of either commercial insurance programs or medicare 
although we review the credit risk of our commercial payors and customers regularly  such risks may 
table of contents arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to anticipate or control  such as a general economic downturn 
if our payors or customers default on their payments to us in the future  we may have to record higher provisions for allowances for doubtful accounts or incur bad debt write offs  both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
delays in collection of our accounts receivable could adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
prompt billing and collection are important factors in our liquidity 
billing and collection of our accounts receivable are subject to the complex regulations that govern medicare and medicaid reimbursement and rules imposed by non government payors 
our inability  or the inability of our customers  to bill and collect on a timely basis pursuant to these regulations and rules could subject us to payment delays that could negatively impact our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
in addition  we may experience delays in reimbursement as a result of the failure to receive prompt approvals related to change of ownership applications for acquired or other facilities or from delays caused by our or other third parties information system failures 
significant delays in billing and or collections may adversely affect the borrowing base under the abl facility  potentially limiting the availability of funds under the abl facility 
failure to maintain the security and functionality of our information systems could adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operation and liquidity 
we are dependent on the proper function and availability of our information systems and related software programs 
though we have taken steps to protect the safety and security of our information systems and the patient health information and other data maintained within those systems  there can be no assurance that our safety and security measures and disaster recovery plan will prevent damage  interruption or breach of our information systems and operations 
as a result of our acquisition activities  we have acquired additional information systems 
we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate  have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities  and are gradually migrating to fewer information systems 
our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain  protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in technology  evolving industry and regulatory standards  and changing customer preferences 
in addition  certain software supporting our business and information systems are licensed to us by independent software developers 
our inability  or the inability of these developers  to continue to maintain and upgrade our information systems and software could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations 
in addition  costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems also could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations 
failure to maintain the security and functionality of our information systems and related software could expose the company to a number of adverse consequences  the vast majority of which are not insurable  including but not limited to disruptions in our operations  regulatory and other civil and criminal penalties  breach of patient information  loss of customers  disputes with payors and increased operating expense  which either individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
terrorist attacks  pandemics or natural disasters could negatively impact our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
terrorist attacks  pandemics  or acts of nature  such as floods  fires  hurricanes  tornadoes or earthquakes  may cause damage or disruption to us  our employees and our facilities  which could have an adverse impact on 
table of contents our residents and patients 
in order to provide care for our residents and patients  we are dependent upon consistent and reliable delivery of food  pharmaceuticals  power and other products to our facilities and the availability of employees to provide services at our facilities 
if the delivery of goods or the ability of employees to reach our facilities were interrupted due to a natural disaster  pandemic or a terrorist attack  it could have a significant negative impact on our business 
furthermore  the impact  or impending threat  of a natural disaster has in the past and may in the future require that we evacuate one or more facilities  which would be costly and would involve substantial risks to our operations and potentially to our residents and patients 
the impact of natural disasters  pandemics and terrorist attacks is inherently uncertain 
such events could severely damage or destroy one or more of our facilities  harm our business  reputation and financial performance or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could adversely impact our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
climate change could have a potential economic impact on us and climate change mitigation programs and regulations could increase our costs 
energy costs could be higher as a result of climate change regulations 
our costs could increase if utility companies pass on their costs  such as those associated with carbon taxes  emission cap and trade programs  or renewable portfolio standards 
in addition  climate change may increase the frequency or intensity of natural disasters 
as such  we cannot assure you that climate change will not adversely impact our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
the inability or failure of management in the future to conclude that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  or the inability of our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report of our internal control over financial reporting  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  and our independent registered public accounting firm also must audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis 
if we fail to have  or management or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to conclude that we maintain  effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting  we could be unable to provide timely and reliable financial information which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
different interpretations of accounting principles or changes in generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
generally accepted accounting principles are complex  continually evolving and changing and may be subject to varied interpretation by third parties  including the sec 
such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances 
differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles or changes in generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity

our rehabilitation division provided rehabilitation services primarily in hospitals and long term care settings 
our home health and hospice business provided home health  hospice and private duty services from locations in eight states 
in recent years  we have completed several strategic divestitures to improve our future operating results 
for accounting purposes  the operating results of these businesses and the losses or impairments associated with these transactions have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented 
assets not sold at december  have been measured at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less costs of disposal and have been classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the operating results of acquired businesses have been included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements from the respective acquisition dates 
rehabcare merger on june   we completed the rehabcare merger 
upon consummation of the rehabcare merger  each issued and outstanding share of rehabcare common stock was converted into the right to receive the merger consideration 
we issued approximately million shares of our common stock in connection with the rehabcare merger 
the purchase price totaled million and was comprised of million in cash and million of our common stock at fair value 
we also assumed million of long term debt in the rehabcare merger  of which million was refinanced on june  the operating results of rehabcare have been included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements since june  at the rehabcare merger date  we acquired ltac hospitals  five irfs  approximately  rehabilitation therapy sites of service and hospital based inpatient rehabilitation units 
the rehabcare merger expanded our service offerings  positioned us for future growth and provided opportunities for significant operating synergies 
in connection with the rehabcare merger  we entered into the new credit facilities and successfully completed the private placement of the notes 
we used proceeds from the new credit facilities and the notes to pay the merger consideration  repay all amounts outstanding under our and rehabcare s previous credit facilities and to pay transaction costs 
the amounts outstanding under our and rehabcare s former credit facilities that were repaid at the rehabcare merger closing were million and million  respectively 
the new credit facilities have incremental facility capacity in an aggregate amount between the two facilities of million  subject to meeting certain conditions  including a specified senior secured leverage ratio 
in connection with these new credit arrangements  we paid million of lender fees related to debt issuance that were capitalized as deferred financing costs and paid million of other financing costs that were charged to interest expense 

table of contents all obligations under the new credit facilities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  subject to certain exceptions  by substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect domestic owned subsidiaries  as well as certain non owned domestic subsidiaries as we may determine from time to time in our sole discretion 
the notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic owned subsidiaries 
the agreements governing the new credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes include a number of restrictive covenants that  among other things and subject to certain exceptions and baskets  impose operating and financial restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries 
in addition  we are required to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum total leverage ratio under the new credit facilities 
these financing agreements governing the new credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes also contain customary affirmative covenants and events of default 
see liquidity for additional information on the new credit facilities and the notes 
professional acquisition on september   we completed the professional acquisition  which was financed through operating cash flows and proceeds from our abl facility 
the professional acquisition included home health and hospice locations in northern california  arizona  nevada and utah 
vista acquisition on november   we completed the vista acquisition  which was financed through operating cash flows and proceeds from our former revolving credit facility 
the vista acquisition included four freestanding hospitals and one hih with a total of beds  all of which are located in southern california 
we did not acquire the working capital of vista or assume any of its liabilities 
all of the vista hospitals are leased 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we have agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to each of our operating divisions 
these payment arrangements may be based upon prospective rates  reimbursable costs  established charges  discounted charges or per diem payments 
net patient service revenue is recorded at the estimated net realizable amounts from medicare  medicaid  medicare advantage  other third party payors and individual patients for services rendered 
retroactive adjustments that are likely to result from future examinations by third party payors are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted as necessary in future periods based upon new information or final settlements 

table of contents a summary of revenues by payor type follows in thousands year ended december  medicare medicaid medicare advantage other eliminations collectibility of accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from the medicare and medicaid programs  other government programs  managed care health plans  commercial insurance companies  skilled nursing and hospital customers  and individual patients and other customers 
estimated provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including the age of the accounts  changes in collection patterns  the composition of patient accounts by payor type  the status of ongoing disputes with third party payors and general industry conditions 
actual collections of accounts receivable in subsequent periods may require changes in the estimated provision for loss 
changes in these estimates are charged or credited to the results of operations in the period of the change 
the provision for doubtful accounts totaled million for  million for and million for allowances for insurance risks we insure a substantial portion of our professional liability risks and workers compensation risks through our limited purpose insurance subsidiary 
provisions for loss for these risks are based upon management s best available information including actuarially determined estimates 
the allowance for professional liability risks includes an estimate of the expected cost to settle reported claims and an amount  based upon past experiences  for losses incurred but not reported 
these liabilities are necessarily based upon estimates and  while management believes that the provision for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of  or less than  the amounts recorded 
to the extent that expected ultimate claims costs vary from historical provisions for loss  future earnings will be charged or credited 
provisions for loss for professional liability risks retained by our limited purpose insurance subsidiary have been discounted based upon actuarial estimates of claim payment patterns using a discount rate of to depending upon the policy year 
the discount rate was for the and policy years  for the policy year and to for all prior policy years 
the discount rates are based upon the risk free interest rate for the respective year 
amounts equal to the discounted loss provision are funded annually 
we do not fund the portion of professional liability risks related to estimated claims that have been incurred but not reported 
accordingly  these liabilities are not discounted 
the allowance for professional liability risks aggregated million at december  and million at december  if we did not discount any of the allowances for professional liability risks  these balances would have approximated million at december  and million at december  
table of contents as a result of improved professional liability underwriting results of our limited purpose insurance subsidiary  we received distributions of million in  million in and million in from our limited purpose insurance subsidiary in accordance with applicable regulations 
these distributions had no impact on earnings and the proceeds were used primarily to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
changes in the number of professional liability claims and the cost to settle these claims significantly impact the allowance for professional liability risks 
a relatively small variance between our estimated and actual number of claims or average cost per claim could have a material impact  either favorable or unfavorable  on the adequacy of the allowance for professional liability risks 
for example  a variance in the allowance for professional liability risks at december  would impact our operating income by approximately million 
the provision for professional liability risks continuing operations  including the cost of coverage maintained with unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers  aggregated million for  million for and million for changes in estimates for prior year professional liability costs reduced professional liability costs by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
with respect to our discontinued operations  we recorded favorable pretax adjustments of million in  million in and million in resulting from changes in estimates for professional liability reserves related to prior years 
provisions for loss for workers compensation risks retained by our limited purpose insurance subsidiary are not discounted and amounts equal to the loss provision are funded annually 
the allowance for workers compensation risks aggregated million at december  and million at december  the provision for workers compensation risks continuing operations  including the cost of coverage maintained with unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers  aggregated million for  million for and million for the increase in workers compensation costs in each of these years was primarily attributable to an increase in claims resulting from the growth in the number of employees

accounting for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes is based upon our annual reported income or loss for each respective accounting period 
we recognize an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
these temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating losses nols and capital loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided for these deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our effective income tax rate was in  in and in the change in the effective income tax rate in was primarily attributable to certain impairment charges and transaction costs that are not deductible for income tax purposes 
we recorded favorable income tax adjustments related to the resolution of certain income tax contingencies from prior years that reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately million in each of and  and approximately million in there are significant uncertainties with respect to capital loss carryforwards that could affect materially the realization of certain deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we have recognized deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not they will be realized and a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets to the extent that it is uncertain that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
we recognized net deferred tax liabilities totaling million at december  and net deferred tax assets totaling million at december  
table of contents we identified deferred income tax assets for state income tax nols of million at each of december  and and a corresponding deferred income tax valuation allowance of million at each of december  and for that portion of the net deferred income tax assets that we will likely not realize in the future 
we have deferred tax assets for federal income tax nols of million with no deferred income tax valuation allowances at december  the federal income tax nols expire in various amounts through we are subject to various federal and state income tax audits in the ordinary course of business 
such audits could result in increased tax payments  interest and penalties 
while we believe our tax positions are appropriate  we cannot assure you that the various authorities engaged in the examination of our income tax returns will not challenge our positions 
we record accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
accrued interest related to uncertain tax provisions totaled million as of december  and million as of december  to the extent the unrecognized income tax benefits become realized or the related accrued interest is no longer necessary  our provision for income taxes would be favorably impacted by million 
the federal statute of limitations remains open for tax years through during  we resolved federal income tax audits for the through tax years 
we have been notified by the internal revenue service the irs that an examination will be conducted for the tax year 
we have been accepted into the irs s compliance assurance process cap for the tax year 
cap is an enhanced  real time review of a company s tax positions and compliance 
we expect participation in cap to improve the timeliness of our federal tax examinations 
state jurisdictions generally have statutes of limitations for tax returns ranging from three to five years 
the state impact of federal income tax changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the states 
we currently have various state income tax returns under examination 
during  we received approval from the irs for an accounting method change for income tax purposes that resulted in a non recurring reduction in income tax payments of approximately million 
our earnings were not impacted by this transaction 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets we regularly review the carrying value of certain long lived assets and finite lived intangible assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate an impairment or an adjustment to the amortization period is necessary 
if circumstances suggest that the recorded amounts cannot be recovered based upon estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the carrying values of such assets are reduced to fair value 
in assessing the carrying values of long lived assets  we estimate future cash flows at the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
for this purpose  these cash flows are aggregated based upon the contractual agreements underlying the operation of the facility or group of facilities 
generally  an individual facility is considered the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
however  to the extent that groups of facilities are leased under a master lease agreement in which the operations of a facility and compliance with the lease terms are interdependent upon other facilities in the agreement including our ability to renew the lease or divest a particular property  we define the group of facilities under a master lease agreement as the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
accordingly  the estimated cash flows of all facilities within a master lease agreement are aggregated for purposes of evaluating the carrying values of long lived assets 

table of contents our intangible assets with finite lives are amortized in accordance with the authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to years 
as a result of the rehabcare merger  we acquired finite lived intangible assets consisting of customer relationships million  a trade name million and non compete agreements million with estimated useful lives ranging from two to years 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to perform an impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually or more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
at december  and  the market value of our common stock was below our book equity value 
management believes that the difference between our market equity value and our book equity at december  is generally attributable to widespread uncertainty in healthcare equity markets related to efforts by the federal government to control or reduce deficit spending through reductions in medicare payments to healthcare providers 
in addition  our market equity value has been negatively impacted by regulatory changes that went into effect october  for our nursing center division and our rehabilitation division 
as discussed below  goodwill impairment charges have been recorded in each of these divisions in subsequent to these regulatory changes 
management believes that the difference between our market equity value and our book equity during was generally attributable to uncertainty in equity markets related to certain medicare regulatory changes that went into effect october  for our nursing center division and our rehabilitation division and uncertainty related to the enactment of healthcare reform legislation during some of the uncertainty surrounding the medicare regulatory changes and its impact on us was alleviated on december  when we updated earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of and provided earnings guidance for the first time 
the earnings guidance  which included the impact of the regulatory changes for both periods  provided a stronger earnings outlook than expected by investors 
the difference between the book equity value and the market value of our common stock during was a potential indication that the carrying value of our goodwill may have been impaired but was not viewed as a triggering event 
on july   cms issued the cms rules 
in connection with the preparation of our third quarter operating results  we determined that the impact of the cms rules was a triggering event in the third quarter of and accordingly tested the recoverability of nursing and rehabilitation center property and equipment asset groups impacted by the reduced medicare payments 
we recorded pretax impairment charges aggregating million million net of income taxes in the third quarter of the charges included million of goodwill which represented the entire nursing and rehabilitation centers reporting unit goodwill and million of property and equipment 
in addition  we recorded pretax impairment charges in the fourth quarter of aggregating million million net of income taxes of property and equipment expended in the same nursing and rehabilitation center asset groups 
these charges reflected the amount by which the carrying value of certain assets exceeded their estimated fair value 
the impairment charges did not impact our cash flows or liquidity 
since the effective date of the cms rules on october   the estimated negative impact from changes in the reimbursement of group rehabilitation therapy services to medicare beneficiaries has been greater than expected 
during the fourth quarter of  we lowered our cash flow expectations for our skilled nursing rehabilitation services reporting unit  causing the carrying value of goodwill of this reporting unit to exceed its estimated fair value in testing the recoverability of goodwill 
as a result  we recorded a pretax impairment charge of million million net of income taxes in the fourth quarter of we also reviewed the other intangible assets and long lived assets related to the skilled nursing rehabilitation services reporting unit and determined there were no impairments of these assets 
the impairment charge did not impact our cash flows or liquidity 

table of contents we perform our annual goodwill impairment test at the end of each fiscal year for each of our reporting units 
a reporting unit is either an operating segment or one level below the operating segment  referred to as a component 
when the components within our operating segments have similar economic characteristics  we aggregate the components of our operating segments into one reporting unit 
accordingly  we have determined that our reporting units are hospitals  nursing and rehabilitation centers  skilled nursing rehabilitation services  hospital rehabilitation services  home health and hospice 
the carrying value of goodwill for each of our reporting units at december  and december  follows in thousands december  december  hospitals nursing and rehabilitation centers rehabilitation division skilled nursing rehabilitation services hospital rehabilitation services home health hospice as a result of the rehabcare merger  goodwill was preliminarily assigned to our hospital reporting unit million  skilled nursing rehabilitation services reporting unit million and hospital rehabilitation services reporting unit million 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
based upon the results of the step one impairment test for goodwill for hospitals  hospital rehabilitation services  home health and hospice reporting units for the year ended december   no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in connection with our annual impairment test 
based upon the results of the step one impairment test for goodwill for all of our reporting units for the years ended december  and  no impairment charges were recorded in connection with our annual impairment tests 
since quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available  we apply judgment in determining the fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test 
we rely on widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses approaches  which capture both the future income potential of the reporting unit and the market behaviors and actions of market participants in the industry that includes the reporting unit 
these types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows  industry specific economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
the discounted cash flow approach uses a projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital 
under the discounted cash flow approach  the projection uses management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period for each reporting unit including growth rates in the number of admissions  patient days  reimbursement rates  operating costs  rent expense and capital expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  changes in working capital requirements and weighted average cost of capital 
the market multiple analysis estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit s operating results 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics to the reporting units 
adverse changes in the operating environment and related key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets or declines in the value of our common stock may result in future impairment charges for a portion or all of these assets 
specifically  if the rate of growth of 
table of contents government and commercial revenues earned by our reporting units were to be less than projected or if healthcare reforms were to negatively impact our business  an impairment charge of a portion or all of these assets may be required 
an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations  but would not be expected to have an impact on our cash flows or liquidity 
our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of trade names  medicare certifications and certificates of need 
the fair values of our indefinite lived intangible assets are derived from current market data and projections at a facility level which include management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in the number of admissions  patient days  reimbursement rates  operating costs  rent expense and capital expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  changes in working capital requirements and weighted average cost of capital 
certificates of need intangible assets are estimated primarily using both a replacement cost methodology and an excess earnings method  a form of discounted cash flows  which is based upon the concept that net after tax cash flows provide a return supporting all of the assets of a business enterprise 
at december   the carrying value of our certificates of need intangible assets exceeded its fair value as a result of declining earnings and cash flows related to five hospitals and two co located nursing and rehabilitation centers in massachusetts  all of which were acquired in the declining earnings and cash flows are attributable to a difficult ltac operating environment in massachusetts in which we have been unable to achieve consistent operating results  as well as automatic future medicare reimbursement reductions triggered in december by the budget control act of in addition  we decided in the fourth quarter of to close one of the five hospitals 
the pretax impairment charge related to the certificates of need totaled million million net of income taxes 
we reviewed the other long lived assets related to these five hospitals and two co located nursing and rehabilitation centers and determined there was no impairment 
based upon the results of the annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets other than certificates of need intangible assets discussed above for the years ended december   and  no impairment charges were recorded 
in addition  no impairment charges were recorded for certificates of need intangible assets for the years ended december  and as a result of the rehabcare merger  we acquired indefinite lived intangible assets consisting of trade names million  medicare certifications million and certificates of need million

the rehabcare merger significantly expanded the size and scale of two of our most profitable businesses  ltac hospitals and contract rehabilitation therapy services  and expanded our post acute service offerings with the addition of irfs and inpatient rehabilitation units 
the operating results of rehabcare are included in our consolidated financial statements since the completion of the acquisition on june our expansion into the home health and hospice business also was accelerated during  with three acquisitions completed primarily in cluster markets where we operate other established post acute businesses 
our fourth quarter home health and hospice operations were profitable and reflected annualized revenues in this business of over million 
in the fourth quarter of  medicare regulatory changes significantly affected our nursing center division and rehabilitation division and caused a material decline in consolidated earnings 
we continue to focus our efforts on various operational adjustments to mitigate the negative impact of these regulatory changes 
our acquisition activities in  along with the organic growth in our existing operations  produced significant revenue growth 
for the year  consolidated revenues rose to billion from billion in as a result of significant transaction related costs  asset impairment charges  and certain other items  we 
table of contents reported a loss of million from continuing operations in as further discussed in the detailed review of our business segment results  our underlying operations in reflected solid execution of our business strategy and improved financial and operational flexibility to manage our enterprise in a period of significant change and uncertainty 
despite the significant reimbursement pressures in our industry  we will continue to focus on five key business strategies 
providing quality  clinical based care while efficiently managing our costs  expanding our presence in the home health and hospice business  accelerating our cluster market strategy  re deploying assets and management time to higher margin growth businesses  and participating in the development of new integrated care and payment models 
hospital division revenues increased in to billion and in to billion 
revenue growth in was primarily a result of the rehabcare merger and the vista acquisition

hospital operating margins were in compared to in and in the increase in operating margins in was primarily attributable to higher reimbursement rates and cost efficiencies associated with volume growth 
aggregate operating income associated with the rehabcare merger and the vista acquisition was million in despite sluggish admission volumes in  low wage rate growth and changes to employee benefit programs stabilized overall compensation costs as a percentage of revenues at for both and however  growth in physician service costs and professional liability costs led to an operating margin decline in physician service costs rose to million in while professional liability costs grew to million in average hourly wage rates rose in and were relatively unchanged in employee benefit costs increased in compared to  primarily attributable to the rehabcare merger and the vista acquisition  and increased in compared to professional liability costs were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
nursing center division revenues increased in and in revenue growth in each of the past two years was primarily attributable to growth in admissions and reimbursement rate increases that reflected inflationary adjustments and higher patient acuity levels 
we expect medicare revenues to be significantly reduced in and in future periods as a result of the cms rules 
in addition  see part i item a risk factors changes in the reimbursement rates or methods or timing of payment from third party payors  including the 
table of contents medicare and medicaid programs  or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursement for our services and products could result in a substantial reduction in our revenues and operating margins 
on a same facility basis  nursing center admissions increased in and in compared to prior periods  while same facility patient days declined in both and compared to prior periods as a result of declines in average length of stay 
nursing center operating margins were in compared to in and in the increase in operating margins in was primarily attributable to higher reimbursement rates  increases in medicare and managed care payor mix  and operating efficiencies associated with the growth in admissions

rehabilitation therapy and pharmacy costs rose to million in in addition  medicaid rate pressures in many states also contributed to lower operating margins in we expect that operating margins will be significantly reduced in and in future periods as a result of the cms rules 
average hourly wage rates increased in and in compared to the previous year 
employee benefit costs increased in and  as a result of certain plan changes in  employee benefit costs declined in during  we outsourced certain facility maintenance functions which resulted in a decline of approximately million in salaries  wages and benefits costs and a corresponding increase in other operating expenses

operating cash flows for were negatively impacted by million million net of income taxes of transaction  severance and financing payments  primarily related to the rehabcare merger 
transaction  severance and retirement payments unrelated to the rehabcare merger for were million million net of income taxes 
during  lower accounts receivable collections were primarily as a result of temporary billing delays caused by information systems conversions related to the rehabcare merger and fiscal intermediary processing delays related to the cms rules 
income tax payments were favorably impacted by favorable income tax legislation related to the depreciation of property and equipment in  and in by the realized losses on sales of discontinued operations and a tax accounting method change approved by the irs in excluding transaction  severance  retirement and financing payments  our operating cash flows in each of the last three years exceeded our routine and development capital spending 

table of contents we utilize our abl facility to meet working capital needs and finance our acquisition and development activities

pursuant to a registration rights agreement  we filed with the sec a registration statement related to an offer to exchange the notes for an issue of sec registered notes with substantially identical terms 
the exchange offer commenced on october  and was completed on november  interest rate swaps in december  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to hedge our floating interest rate on an aggregate of million of outstanding term loan facility debt 
the interest rate swaps have an effective date of january   and expire on january  we are required to make payments based upon a fixed interest rate of calculated on the notional amount of million

we believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to improve and equip our existing facilities 
expenditures for acquisitions totaled million in  million in and million in to the extent that the expenditures for acquisitions other than the rehabcare merger were not financed through the use of operating cash flows  we utilized our abl facility to finance these transactions 
for the rehabcare merger  we utilized our common stock  the abl facility  the term loan facility and the notes to finance the transaction 
the more significant acquisitions in the past three years included the rehabcare merger in june million in cash and million in our common stock  the professional acquisition in september million  the vista acquisition in november million  the purchase of three nursing and rehabilitation centers in september million and the acquisition of previously leased facilities in the last three years million 

table of contents in  we purchased the nursing centers from ventas for approximately million and subsequently sold these facilities for million 
see part i item business discontinued operations 
potential renewal of ventas facilities as noted in part i item business master lease agreements  we have until april  to renew the group and group facilities 
we have announced that we intend to renew the renewal facilities  which contain  licensed nursing and rehabilitation center beds and licensed hospital beds and generated revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  the current annual rent for the renewal facilities approximates million 
we also have announced that we do not intend to renew the expiring facilities  which contain  licensed nursing and rehabilitation center beds and  licensed hospital beds and generated revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  the current annual rent for the expiring facilities approximates million 
we will continue to operate the expiring facilities and include the expiring facilities in our results from continuing operations through the expiration of the lease term in april we believe that the divesture of the expiring facilities could reduce our consolidated earnings per diluted share by to in  but will not otherwise materially impact our cash flows or financial position 
this estimate is based upon a number of assumptions  including our estimated impact of the recent and impending medicare reimbursement reductions for nursing centers and ltac hospitals and our ability to achieve overhead savings in connection with these divestitures 
other information effects of inflation and changing prices we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs 
we have been  and could be in the future  materially adversely affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third party payors to contain healthcare costs 
as previously discussed  the cms rules have significantly reduced medicare revenues in our nursing and rehabilitation center and rehabilitation therapy businesses 
we cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental and private third party payor programs  including medicare supplemental insurance policies  will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to these programs 
medicare reimbursement in ltac hospitals  irfs and nursing and rehabilitation centers is subject to fixed payments under the medicare prospective payment systems 
in accordance with medicare laws  cms makes annual adjustments to medicare payment rates in many prospective payment systems under what is commonly known as a market basket update 
each year  medpac makes payment policy recommendations to congress for a variety of medicare payment systems 
congress is not obligated to adopt medpac recommendations  and  based upon outcomes in previous years  there can be no assurance that congress will adopt medpac s recommendations in a given year 
medicaid reimbursement rates in many states in which we operate nursing and rehabilitation centers also are based upon fixed payment systems 
generally  these rates are adjusted for inflation 
however  these adjustments may not reflect the actual increase in the costs of providing healthcare services 
in addition  medicaid reimbursement can be impacted negatively by state budgetary pressures  which may lead to reduced reimbursement or delays in receiving payments 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the facilities operated by us  or the provision of goods and services offered by us  will meet the requirements for participation in such programs 
healthcare reforms under the aca will affect each of our businesses and are directed in large part at cost reduction 
these changes could reduce the payments for our services and negatively impact insurance companies and other third party payors 
the reforms also include possible modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment  bundling payments to cover both acute and post acute care and enrollment limitations on new providers 
the aca includes reductions to the annual market basket payment updates for ltac hospitals and irfs  which 
table of contents could reduce the update to less than zero resulting in lower reimbursement than in the preceding year 
in addition to specific market basket reductions  the annual market basket payment update for ltac hospitals  irfs and nursing centers must be reduced for a productivity adjustment determined annually by cms that began being implemented on october  the aca also requires implementation of quality indicators 
the aca requires reductions to updates in the standard federal rate to ltac hospitals that began in the rate year and productivity adjustment reductions in updates to payments for ltac hospitals and nursing and rehabilitation centers beginning in fiscal year  which in each case may cause reimbursement to be less than in the prior year 
in addition  under the aca  beginning in fiscal year  medicare payments to hospitals  including ltac hospitals and irfs  will be reduced if the hospital fails to meet certain quality data or fails to comply with new value based purchasing demonstration project programs 
nursing and rehabilitation centers also will be subject to reductions in reimbursement beginning in fiscal year if they fail to meet the quality data reporting or standards in new value based purchasing demonstration project programs 
the budget control act of  enacted on august   increased the united states debt ceiling in connection with deficit reductions over the next ten years 
the budget control act of also established a member joint committee of congress known as the joint select committee on deficit reduction 
the goal of the joint select committee on deficit reduction was to propose legislation to reduce the united states federal deficit by trillion for fiscal years to however  legislation was not enacted by the december  deadline  and therefore trillion in domestic and defense spending reductions will automatically begin february   split evenly between domestic and defense spending 
payments to medicare providers are subject to these automatic spending reductions  subject to a cap 
at this time  we believe this will result in an automatic reduction on each claim submitted to medicare beginning february  reductions to medicare and medicaid reimbursement resulting from the budget control act of could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we cannot predict the adjustments to medicare payment rates that congress or cms may make in the future 
congress  medpac  and cms will continue to address reimbursement rates for a variety of healthcare settings 
any downward adjustment to rates  or another pricing roll back  for the types of facilities we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  there are continuing efforts to reform governmental healthcare programs that could result in major changes in the healthcare delivery and reimbursement systems on a national and state level and we cannot assure you that healthcare reform  future healthcare legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental healthcare programs will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we believe that our operating margins also will continue to be under pressure as the growth in operating expenses  particularly professional liability  labor and employee benefits costs  exceeds payment increases from third party payors 
in addition  as a result of competitive pressures  our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to private patients is limited
