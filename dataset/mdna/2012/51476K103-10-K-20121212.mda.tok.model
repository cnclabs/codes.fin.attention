item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our annual audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
for additional information regarding forward looking statements and risk factors  see forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors 
in the accompanying analysis of financial information  we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
some of this data is considered non gaap financial measures 
for such measures  we have provided supplemental explanations and reconciliations in item selected financial data under the heading non gaap financial measures 
on november   we acquired of izi  a medical products manufacturer headquartered in maryland 
accordingly  its operating results from the acquisition date have been accounted for in the current year with no prior year comparison 
in connection with the acquisition of izi during the first quarter of fiscal  the company began to operate in three reportable segments  radiation measurement  medical physics and medical products 
overview in fiscal landauer continued its plan to execute the radiation safety continuum by acquiring izi  which provides medical consumable products used in radiology  radiation therapy  and image guided surgery procedures 
another key development was the go live in july of our it platform enhancement  after years and significant spending 
the company looks to leverage these major accomplishments with its existing businesses  radiation measurement and medical physics  to provide the complete radiation package measuring dose to worker  dose to patient and dose accuracy 
landauer s radiation measurement segment is a mature business and growth in numbers of customers is modest 
in recent years  the company s strategy has been to expand into new international markets  primarily by partnering with existing dosimetry service providers with a prominent local presence 
in addition  the company has been developing new platforms and formats for its osl technology  such as inlight  to gain access to markets where the company previously did not have a significant presence  such as smaller in house and commercial laboratories  nuclear power facilities  tactical military measurement and hospitals to support measurement of patient exposure to radiation 
revenue growth in recent years has occurred as a result of entry into new markets through joint ventures and acquisitions  modest unit growth  sale of inlight equipment and badges  and new ancillary opportunities to obtain regular price increases from its customers 
the continued economic downturn and uncertain impact of healthcare reform has resulted in increased pricing pressure with the company s healthcare customer base  which is expected to continue into the future 
through its lmp operations  the company provides therapeutic and imaging physics services to the medical community 
lmp is the leading nationwide provider of medical physics services to hospitals  free standing imaging centers and radiation therapy centers 
medical physics services is a large fragmented market 
market growth is expected to be driven by the utilization of radiation in the provision of healthcare  trends towards outsourcing of services in healthcare settings  and a tightening domestic supply of qualified medical physicists 
in june  landauer  through its lmp operations  completed the acquisition of the assets of ump  a provider of imaging physics services in upstate new york 
in addition  smaller regional practices were also acquired in  and to augment the lmp operations 
the company reports these operating results in the medical physics reporting segment 

table of contents in november  landauer completed the acquisition of izi 
izi is a leading global provider of high quality medical consumable accessories used in radiology  radiation therapy  and image guided surgery procedures 
izi s customer base includes buyers at several stages along the supply chain including distributors  manufacturers of image guided navigation equipment  and product end users such as community hospitals  radiation oncology clinics  mammography clinics  and imaging centers 
izi s medical accessories range from consumables used with mri  ct  and mammography technologies to highly engineered passive reflective markers used during image guided surgery procedures 
in alignment with treatment trends which increasingly utilize radiation for the diagnosis and treatment of disease  as well as growing demand for minimally invasive procedures  izi products provide the ability to increase procedural accuracy while decreasing procedural time 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that management make assumptions and estimates that affect the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements as well as related disclosures 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
below are the critical accounting policies which have been applied in the preparation of the company s financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition and deferred contract revenue the source of radiation measurement segment revenues for the company is radiation measuring and measurement services including other services incidental to measuring and monitoring 
the measuring and monitoring services provided by the company to its customers are of a subscription nature and are continuous 
the company views its business in the radiation measurement segment as services provided to customers over a period of time and the wear period is the period over which those services are provided 
badge production  wearing of badges  badge analysis  and report preparation are integral to the benefit that the company provides to its customers 
these services are provided to customers on an agreed upon recurring basis monthly  bi monthly  quarterly  semi annually or annually that the customer chooses for the wear period 
revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  adjusted for changes in pricing and volume  over the wear period as the service is continuous and no other discernible pattern of recognition is evident 
revenues are recognized over the periods in which the customers wear the badges irrespective of whether invoiced in advance or in arrears 
the company  through its medical physics segment  offers full scope medical physics services to hospitals and radiation therapy centers 
services offered include  but are not limited to  clinical physics support in radiation oncology  commissioning services  special projects support and imaging physics services 
delivery of the medical physics services can be of a contracted  recurring nature or as a discrete project with a defined service outcome 
recurring services often are provided on the customer s premises by a full time employee or fraction of a full time employee 
these services are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
fee for service projects revenue is recognized when the service is delivered 
contracted services are billed on an agreed upon recurring basis  either in advance or arrears of the service being delivered 
customers may be billed monthly  quarterly  or at some other regular interval over the contracted period 
the amounts recorded as deferred revenue represent invoiced amounts in advance of delivery of the service 
management believes that the amount of deferred contract revenue fairly represents remaining business activity with customers invoiced in advance 
fee for service revenue is typically associated with much shorter contract periods  or with discrete individual projects 
invoicing is usually done after completion of the project and customer acceptance thereof 
the medical products segment offers a broad product portfolio ranging from consumables used with mri  ct  and mammography technologies to highly engineered consumable passive reflective markers used during image guided surgery procedures 
the company recognizes revenue upon product shipment  provided that a purchase order has been received or a contract has been executed  there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is deemed probable 

table of contents the amounts recorded as deferred contract revenue in the consolidated balance sheets represent invoiced amounts in advance of delivery of the service  and are net of services rendered through the respective consolidated balance sheet date 
such advance billings amounted to million and million  respectively  as of september  and property  plant equipment and other assets maintenance and repairs are charged to expense  and renewals and betterments are capitalized 
plant and equipment and other assets  primarily dosimetry badges  are recorded at cost and are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are primarily years for buildings  three to eight years for equipment  five to ten years for internal software and thirty months to eight years for other assets 
the company assesses the carrying value and the remaining useful lives of its property  plant  equipment  and other assets when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life may no longer be appropriate 
factors that could trigger this review include competitive conditions  government regulations and technological changes 
the company capitalizes costs of software which is acquired  internally developed  or modified solely to meet the company s internal needs 
in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance  internal and external costs incurred to develop internal use computer software during the application development stage are capitalized 
costs incurred during the preliminary project stage as well as training costs and maintenance costs during the postimplementation operation stage are expensed 
capitalized costs of software amounted to million and million  respectively  for fiscal and goodwill and other intangible assets the company s intangible assets include purchased customer lists  licenses  patents  trademarks  tradenames and goodwill 
purchased customer lists are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
patents and licenses are also recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which range from to years 
the company acquired goodwill primarily from its acquisitions of landauer europe  sapra landauer  lmp and izi as well as other smaller investments 
goodwill as well as trademarks and tradenames have indefinite lives 
fasb authoritative guidance requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives be reviewed periodically for impairment 
reporting units are business components one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management 
per guidance  two or more components of an operating segment should be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics and are economically interdependent  among other factors 
as a result of this aggregation  the company has three reporting units  radiation measurement  medical physics and medical products 
the company performs an impairment test for each of its reporting units with goodwill annually and  for goodwill and other intangible assets that are not being amortized  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
triggering events include  but are not limited to  a current period operating or cash flow loss  a product  technology  or service introduced by a competitor  or a loss of key personnel 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company performs a financial analysis of future undiscounted cash flows projections by asset or asset group 
in september  the fasb amended its guidance for testing goodwill for impairment 
under the amended guidance  an entity is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in the guidance 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
previously  fasb guidance outlined a two step process for determining the impairment of goodwill 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value is in excess of carrying value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the testing process is conducted on a disaggregated basis  at the reporting unit level 

table of contents the company early adopted the amended guidance at september  landauer first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than the carrying amounts 
in making its determination  the company considered the following factors  events and circumstances macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  other relevant entity specific events  events affecting a reporting unit  and any sustained decrease in share price 
the company performed the qualitative analysis for each of its individual reporting units  radiation measurement  medical physics and medical products 
as a result of its qualitative analysis  the company determined that it is not likely that the fair value of the radiation measurement reporting unit and the medical physics reporting unit are less than their carrying amounts  indicating that goodwill is not impaired 
based on amended guidance  the company was not required to calculate the fair value of the reporting units  and no further testing was performed 
due to the recent acquisition of izi and the subsequent additional medical products reporting unit the company conducted the step goodwill analysis to determine if the new acquisition was impaired 
as a result of this analysis  the company concluded that it was not likely that the fair value of the medical products reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
to the extent subsequent events arise  market conditions change or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the conclusion regarding whether the company s goodwill is impaired could change and result in future goodwill impairment charges that will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
information regarding the value of goodwill and other intangible assets is presented under the footnote goodwill and other intangible assets in item of this annual report on form k 
income taxes the company estimates the income tax provision for income taxes that are currently payable  and records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences in tax consequences between the financial statements and tax returns 
temporary differences result from  among other events  revenues  expenses  gains  or losses that are included in taxable income of an earlier or later year than the year in which they are recognized in financial income 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
to the extent that deferred tax assets will not likely be recovered from future taxable income  a valuation allowance is established against such deferred tax assets 
the company maintains cash indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
management exercises significant judgment in the valuation of its current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company recognizes the financial statement effects of its tax positions in its current and deferred tax assets and liabilities when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
management considers  among other factors  the company s current and past performance  the market environment in which the company operates  and tax planning strategies 
further  the company provides for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state  local  and foreign tax authorities 
the company assesses and updates its tax positions when significant changes in circumstances occur  which may cause a change in judgment about the likelihood of realizing the deferred items 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
any change to the company s policy on cash indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions would not likely result in any significant incremental us federal and state income tax liability 
further information regarding the company s income taxes is contained under the footnote income taxes in item of this annual report on form k 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans the pension expenses and benefit obligations recorded for the company s defined benefit plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  interest costs  expected compensation increases  benefits earned  mortality rates  and other factors 
management reviews the plan assumptions on an annual basis to ensure that the most current  relevant information is considered 
if actual results vary considerably from those that are expected or if future changes are made to these assumptions  the amounts recognized for these plans could change significantly 

table of contents the weighted average assumed discount rates used to determine plan expenses were for both pension and other benefits in fiscal and for both pension and other benefits in fiscal for fiscal expense  the long term rate of return of plan assets was  unchanged from fiscal in establishing the rate  management considered the historical rates of return and the current and planned asset classes of the plan investment portfolio 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine benefit obligations at september  was compared to the september  rate of  adjusted to reflect the single rate that  when applied to the projected benefit disbursements from the plan  would result in the same discounted value as the array of rates that make up the citigroup pension discount curve as of september the rate of compensation increase was not relevant to the plans in fiscal and due to the plan freeze which occurred in fiscal the company recognizes on its balance sheet the amount by which the projected benefit obligations of its defined benefit plans exceed the fair value of plan assets 
subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans as a result of future transactions and events  amortization of previously unrecognized costs  and changes to actuarial assumptions are recognized as an asset or a liability and amortized as components of net periodic pension cost or accumulated other comprehensive income 
an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management s control could have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
information regarding these plans is contained under the footnote employee benefit plans in item of this annual report on form k 
stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes compensation cost at fair value for all stock based awards  net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards 
the company granted stock options in years prior to fiscal the fair values of options were estimated using a black scholes option pricing model 
in addition to stock options  key employees and or non employee directors are eligible to receive performance shares and restricted stock 
the fair value of performance shares and restricted stock granted under the company s long term incentive plan was based on the average of the company s high and low stock prices on the date of grant 
upon the adoption of the company s incentive compensation plan in february  the fair value of performance shares and restricted stock granted under the new plan is based on the company s closing stock price on the grant date 
the terms of performance share awards allow the recipients of such awards to earn a variable number of shares based on the achievement of the performance goals specified in the awards 
stock based compensation expense associated with performance share awards is recognized based on management s best estimates of the achievement of the performance goals specified in such awards and the resulting number of shares that are expected to be earned 
the company evaluates on a quarterly basis the progress towards achieving the performance criteria 
the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of performance share awards expected to be earned is recognized as compensation cost or as a reduction of cost in the period of the revised estimate 
compensation expense for restricted stock is recognized ratably over the vesting period 
forfeitures of awards are estimated at the time of grant and stock based compensation cost is recognized only for those awards expected to vest 
the company uses historical experience to estimate projected forfeitures 
the company recognizes the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the forfeiture rate  or actual forfeitures  as compensation cost or as a reduction of cost in the period of the revision 
if revisions are made to management s assumptions and estimates or if actual results vary considerably from those that are expected  stock based compensation expense could change significantly  impacting the company s results of operations or financial condition 
further information regarding the company s stock based awards is presented under the footnote stock based compensation in item of this annual report on form k

radiation measurement operating income  adjusted for the impact of acquisition related transaction expenses  asset abandonment charges  it platform enhancement expenses  and non cash stock based compensation expenses  for fiscal decreased  or million  to million compared with adjusted operating income of million for fiscal 
table of contents corporate expenses for shared functions are recognized in the radiation measurement segment where they have been reported historically 
acquisition and reorganization costs are not allocated to the segments 
as the company s business model evolves in increased complexity  management may determine it necessary to change this reporting practice to reflect any appropriate allocations 
medical physics segment medical physics revenues for fiscal of million increased  or million  from fiscal of million on million of organic growth and million due to the impact of acquired companies 
the medical physics segment operating income of million  or of revenues  increased million as compared to a loss of million  or of revenues  for fiscal the improvement in operating income was primarily due to operating efficiencies in the core medical physics business and higher episodic equipment commissioning sales leveraging a relatively fixed cost structure  as well as higher volume sales inclusive of acquired companies 
medical products segment with the acquisition of izi on november   the company now operates in a third reportable segment  medical products 
revenues for the period from the date of acquisition through september  were million 
medical products operating income was million or of revenues for the same period 
given the acquisition of izi was completed during the first quarter of fiscal  there is no direct comparison to the prior fiscal year

the following is a discussion of the company s segment operating results 
radiation measurement segment radiation measurement revenue for fiscal declined  or million to million 
of the decline  million is due to the change in the supply relationship between landauer and nagase landauer  the company s unconsolidated joint venture in japan 
fiscal revenue included sales to nagase landauer  ltd 
of million for badges and services to support its fiscal transition of the japanese service market from the luxel badge to a next generation badge based upon the inlight platform 
with the completion of the transition in the third fiscal quarter of  the joint venture only purchases service badges to support service business growth 
the historical luxel badge revenues were partially replaced by a royalty arrangement  resulting in no corresponding impact on net income 
without the nagase landauer impact  domestic radiation measurement revenue declined  or million  driven by lower non recurring inlight equipment sales  primarily to the canadian government agency responsible for occupational measurement and radiation emergency preparedness for the citizens of canada 
international radiation measurement revenue increased  or million  on million of organic growth in most regions and million from the strengthening of most foreign currencies against the dollar 
radiation measurement gross margin for fiscal increased to from a year ago  primarily due to the decline in lower margin sales to nagase landauer 
selling  general and administrative costs in the radiation measurement segment for fiscal increased  or million  to million 
the increase is due primarily to an additional million of costs to replace the company s it systems and related depreciation  million of increased international spending to support international revenue growth and million from the strengthening of most foreign currencies against the dollar 
acquisition and reorganization costs for fiscal decreased  or million  to million compared to million in fiscal radiation measurement operating income  inclusive of the impact of acquisition related transaction and reorganization costs  for fiscal decreased  or million  to million compared with operating income of million for fiscal medical physics segment medical physics revenue for fiscal increased  or million  to million on million of organic growth and million due to the impact of acquired companies 
medical physics gross margin declined to from in the year ago period due to divestiture of the certain higher margin business in the first fiscal quarter of  and due to non recurring expense in fiscal for workforce realignment  partially offset by improved operating efficiencies in the core medical physics business 
selling  general and administrative costs in the medical physics segment for fiscal increased  or million  to million 
the increase is due to the impact of acquired companies and costs to support organic growth 
medical physics operating loss was million for fiscal  compared with operating loss of million for fiscal 
table of contents fiscal outlook landauer s business plan for fiscal currently anticipates aggregate revenues for the year to be in the range of to million 
the business plan also anticipates million million net of tax of non recurring expense spending to support the post implementation stabilization  and associated customer support  of the company s it platform systems initiative 
the blended effective tax rate for the full fiscal year is anticipated to be within a range of percent to percent 
based upon the above assumptions  the company anticipates reported net income for fiscal in the range of to million and adjusted ebitda expected for fiscal in the range of to million 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased million to million during fiscal the increase in cash on hand was consistent with a change in working capital management associated with the company s existing credit agreement which does not have a daily cash sweep feature against borrowings  resulting in an increase in cash on hand to meet operational needs 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and funds available under its syndicated credit facility 
the company s prior facility old credit agreement was terminated in november  when it was replaced by the new syndicated facility 
no early termination penalties were incurred by landauer in connection with the termination of the old credit agreement 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million  a increase compared to million for fiscal the increase in operating cash flow was driven by an increase in operating performance and decrease in prepaid expenses 
cash used by investing activities for fiscal included million used for the company s acquisitions of joint ventures and businesses  primarily izi  as described under the footnote business combinations herein  compared to million used in the twelve months of fiscal for the establishment of an unconsolidated joint venture in turkey and the acquisition of two diagnostics physics practices 
investing activities included the company s acquisitions of property  plant and equipment of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
included in the acquisitions of property  plant and equipment were costs of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  for the company s it platform enhancement initiative 
the project consists of three phases  of which two phases were implemented in fiscal the total project cost  including non capitalized costs  is estimated currently to be approximately million to million  of which million was incurred as of the end of fiscal once fully operational  the new it platform will require ongoing maintenance expenditures at levels higher than the company has traditionally experienced 
total capital expenditures for fiscal were million  including approximately million for the company s it platform initiative 
financing activities for fiscal were comprised primarily of long term borrowings on the new credit agreement  net borrowings on the company s old credit agreement and payments of cash dividends to shareholders 
during the twelve months of fiscal  the company funded cash dividends of million  or per share  for the fiscal year during the twelve months of fiscal  the company funded cash dividends of million  or per share  for the first  second and third quarters of fiscal and per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal if the company would repatriate cash from its indefinitely reinvested foreign jurisdictions it does not anticipate any significant incremental us federal and state income tax liability 
as of september   the company had borrowings of million outstanding under its old credit agreement originally dated october  in connection with its acquisition of izi in november  the company terminated the old credit agreement 

table of contents on november   landauer entered into a five year syndicated revolving credit agreement with a group of lenders  pursuant to which  the company was provided a senior secured reducing revolving credit facility as amended  from time to time  the bmo harris facility 
the company borrowed million under the bmo harris facility to finance the izi acquisition  to refinance existing indebtedness under the old credit agreement and to fund certain fees and expenses associated with the closing of the bmo harris facility 
the bmo harris facility matures on november   and is secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of landauer and its existing and future material domestic subsidiaries  including a pledge of of the stock of each domestic subsidiary and a pledge of of the stock of each first tier foreign subsidiary
