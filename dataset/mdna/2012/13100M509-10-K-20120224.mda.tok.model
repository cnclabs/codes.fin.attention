overview we are a leading provider in north america of broadband communications access systems and software for fiber and copper based network architectures that enable communications service providers  or csps  to transform their networks and connect to their residential and business subscribers 
we enable csps to provide a wide range of revenue generating services  from basic voice and data to advanced broadband services  over legacy and next generation access networks 
we focus solely on csp access networks  the portion of the network which governs available bandwidth and determines the range and quality of services that can be offered to subscribers 
we develop and sell carrier class hardware and software products  which we refer to as the unified access portfolio that are designed to enhance and transform csp access networks to meet the changing demands of subscribers rapidly and cost effectively 
we market our access systems and software to csps globally through our direct sales force as well as a limited number of resellers 
as of december   we have shipped over fourteen million ports of our unified access portfolio to more than customers worldwide  whose networks serve over million subscriber lines in total 
our customers include of the largest us incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs 
in addition  we have over commercial video customers and have enabled over customers to deploy gigabit passive optical network  or gpon  active ethernet and point to point ethernet fiber access networks 
our revenue has increased from million for to million for and to million for continued revenue growth will depend on our ability to continue to sell our access systems and software to existing customers and to attract new customers  including in particular  those customers in the large csp and international markets 
during the year ended december   orders for our goods and services were relatively flat from the year ended december   primarily due to challenging macroeconomic and capital market conditions that negatively impacted our customer s financial condition and decreased demand for our products 
in  our revenues increased over as macroeconomic and capital market conditions improved which supported customer demand for our products domestically and in the international markets into which we sell our products 
in  our revenues increased over  primarily due to higher shipment revenue resulting from an increase in our customer base from the occam acquisition 
however in the second half of fiscal  we experienced a slowdown in business primarily related to continued delays in broadband stimulus awards under the american recovery and reinvestment act of becoming shippable orders due to challenges that a number of our awarded customers are facing in navigating some of the bureaucratic hurdles of the program 
other factors that contributed to this slowdown include reduced investment in the traditional networks at one of our major customers  the competitive environment  weak macro economic conditions and fiber shortages in certain portions of the market caused by the 
table of contents tsunami in northern japan 
these factors impacted our operating results in the second half of fiscal and we expect some of these issues may continue to impact our operating results in the first half of since our inception we have incurred significant losses and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our net loss was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue fluctuations result from many factors  including but not limited to increases or decreases in customer orders for our products and services  large customer purchase agreements with special revenue considerations  varying budget cycles for our customers and seasonal buying patterns of our customers 
more specifically  our customers tend to spend less in the first fiscal quarter as they are finalizing their annual budgets 
customers then typically decide to purchase our products during our second fiscal quarter 
in our third fiscal quarter  customers are in the process of deploying such products and as a result there is typically less spending 
in addition  difficulties related to deploying products during the winter also tend to limit spending in the third quarter 
finally  in our fourth fiscal quarter  customer purchases typically increase as customers are attempting to spend the rest of their budget for the year 
as of december   our deferred revenue primarily includes rus contracts that include installation services  services  special customer arrangements and ratable recognized services totaling million 
the timing of deferred recognition may cause significant fluctuations in our revenue and operating results from period to period 
cost of revenue is strongly correlated to revenue and will tend to fluctuate from all of the aforementioned factors that could impact revenue 
our cost of revenue for the year ended december   includes merger related expenses and amortization of intangible assets from our acquisition of occam as discussed in more detail in our results of operations discussion 
other additional factors that impact cost of revenue include changes in the mix of products delivered to our customers and changes in the cost of our inventory 
cost of revenue includes fixed expenses related to our internal operations department which could impact our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue  if there are large sequential fluctuations to revenue 
our gross profit and gross margin have been  and will likely be  impacted by several factors  including new product introduction or upgrades to existing products  changes in customer mix  changes in the mix of products demanded and sold  shipment volumes  changes in our product costs  changes in pricing and the extent of customer rebates and incentive programs 
we believe our gross margin could increase due to favorable changes in these factors  for example  increases in sales of our advanced e series ethernet service access platforms  upgrades to our c platform  new introductions of our p series optical network terminal and reductions in the impact of rebate or similar programs 
we believe our gross margin could decrease due to unfavorable changes in factors such as increased product costs  pricing decreases due to competitive pressure and an unfavorable customer or product mix 
changes in these factors could have a material impact on our future average selling prices and unit costs 
also  the timing of deferred revenue recognition and related deferred costs can have a material impact on our gross profit and gross margin results 
the timing of recognition and the relative size of these arrangements could cause large fluctuations in our gross profit from period to period 
additionally  to date we have incurred merger related expenses related to inventory acquired from occam of million resulting from the required revaluation of the inventory to its estimated fair value  in addition to an associated write down of inventory determined as excess and obsolete of million  and the amortization of existing and core developed technologies  purchase order backlog and trade name  totaling million 
existing and core developed technologies  purchase order backlog and trade name acquired from occam will amortize over a maximum period of years 
our operating expenses have fluctuated based on the following factors timing of variable sales compensation expenses due to fluctuations in order volumes  timing of salary increases which have historically occurred in the second quarter  timing of research and development expenses including prototype builds and intermittent outsourced development projects and increases in stock based compensation expenses resulting from modifications to outstanding stock options 
for example  in  reduced operating expenses resulted from a decrease in variable sales compensation expenses coincident with a reduction in customer orders  and reduced spending on customer marketing initiatives and industry tradeshow events relative to the prior year 
in  operating expense increases resulted primarily from stock based compensation expense resulting from the exchange of eligible stock options for restricted stock units  acquisition related costs associated with our efforts to acquire occam networks  inc  the implementation of a corporate bonus plan  an increase in variable sales compensation coincident with an increase in customer orders  increased spending on customer marketing initiatives associated with industry tradeshow events  and other costs associated with becoming a public company 
although the exchange of stock options for restricted stock units was approved by our board of directors in  the restricted stock units received from the exchange did not begin vesting and amortizing to expense until there was a liquidity event  which was our initial public offering in march these restricted stock units were fully vested and all related expense was recorded by april our operating expenses for fiscal  includes merger related expenses and amortization of intangible assets from our acquisition of occam as discussed in more detail below 
as a result of the acquisition we have also incurred increased compensation costs across all operating expense categories due to additional headcount and increased facility related costs 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts but will decline as a percentage of revenue over time 

table of contents as a result of the fluctuations described above and a number of other factors  many of which are outside our control  our annual operating results fluctuate from year to year 
comparing our operating results on a year to year basis may not be meaningful  and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance 
acquisition of occam networks on february   we completed our acquisition of occam  a provider of innovative broadband access products designed to enable telecom service providers to offer bundled voice  video and high speed internet  or triple play  services over both fiber optic and copper networks in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately million which consisted of million of cash consideration and a value of million of common stock and equity awards issued 
through this acquisition  we expect to achieve the strategic benefits of creating a more competitive and efficient company  more capable of competing against larger telecommunications equipment companies in more markets and significant cost synergies as a result of combining the operations of the two companies 
the combined organization provides csps globally with an enhanced portfolio of advanced broadband access systems  and accelerates innovation across our expanded unified access portfolio 
the acquisition resulted in more access options over both fiber and copper for csps to deploy  which could expedite the proliferation of advanced broadband services to both residential and business subscribers  including such services as high speed internet  iptv  voip  ethernet business services  and other advanced broadband applications 
as a result of this acquisition  we recorded million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets 
we are amortizing the finite lived intangible assets over their useful lives 
see critical accounting policies and use of estimates long lived assets  intangible assets with finite lives and goodwill section below for information relating to these items and our test for impairment 
under purchase accounting rules  we revalued the occam assets and liabilities acquired at the time of the acquisition  based on their fair value 
see note  acquisition of occam networks in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information related to this acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
management bases its estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
our management evaluates its estimates  assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
business combination in a business combination  we record tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired at their fair value 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the fair values assigned to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities are based on valuations using management s best estimates and assumptions at the conclusion of the measurement period 
during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date  we are required to retrospectively adjust the provisional assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that  if known  would have resulted in the recognition of those assets or liabilities as of that date 
these assumptions and estimates include a market participant s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant 
our estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
our significant assumptions and estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
we have finalized the fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities from occam as of june  revenue recognition we derive revenue primarily from the sale of hardware products and related software 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we will generally use purchase agreement and or purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
since the individual products and services meet the criteria for separate units of accounting  we will recognize revenue upon delivery of each product and or services 
post sales software support revenue and extended warranty services revenue is deferred and recognized 
table of contents ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
installation and training service arrangements are recognized upon delivery or completion of performance 
these service arrangements are typically short term in nature and are largely completed shortly after delivery of the product 
revenue from package arrangements is recognized upon full delivery of the package 
in instances where substantive acceptance provisions are specified in the customer agreement  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
payment terms to customers predominantly range from net to net days 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based primarily on the creditworthiness and past payment history of the customer 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of revenue 
in certain cases  our products are sold along with services  which include installation  training  post sales software support and or extended warranty services 
to date  service revenue has comprised an insignificant portion of our revenue  and we have not reported service revenue separately from product revenue in our financial statements 
from time to time  we offer customers sales incentives  which include volume rebates and discounts 
these amounts are accrued on a quarterly basis and recorded net of revenue 
we adopted accounting standards update asu no 
 topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and asu no 
 topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements on a prospective basis as of the beginning of for new and materially modified arrangements originating after december  under the new standards  we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each separable element of an arrangement based on the relative selling price of each element 
our products and services qualify as separate units of accounting 
products are typically considered delivered upon shipment and are deemed to be non contingent deliverables 
we provide certain services at stated prices over a specified period of time and must meet specified performance conditions 
as such  we have determined that our individual services are contingent deliverables 
in addition  we provide specified packages of items considered a package arrangement which it also considers a contingent deliverable  and therefore we do not bill our customers until we have fully delivered the package 
the amount of product and service revenue recognized in a given period is affected by the valuation of the units of accounting for multiple element arrangements 
we use vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe of fair value for each of the units  when available 
we have established vsoe for our training and post sales software support services based on the normal pricing practices of these services when sold separately 
in most instances  we are not able to establish vsoe for other deliverables in an arrangement with multiple elements 
this may be due to infrequently selling each element separately  not pricing products within a narrow range  or only having a limited sales history 
when vsoe cannot be established  we attempt to establish selling price of each element based on third party evidence or tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our marketing strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of customization and differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
therefore  we typically are not able to determine tpe 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use the best estimate of selling price or bsp 
the objective of bsp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine bsp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  geographies  market conditions  competitive landscape  internal costs  gross margin objectives  characteristics of targeted customers and pricing practices 
the determination of bsp is made through consultation with and formal approval by management  taking into consideration the go to market strategy 
we regularly review vsoe  tpe and bsp and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates 
there were no material impacts during twelve months ended december   nor do we expect a material impact in the near term from changes in vsoe  tpe or bsp 
we enter into arrangements with certain of our customers who receive government supported loans and grants from the us department of agriculture s rural utility service rus to finance capital spending 
under the terms of an rus equipment contract that includes installation services  the customer does not take possession and control and title does not pass until formal acceptance is obtained from the customer 
under this type of arrangement  we do not recognize revenue until we have received formal acceptance from the customer 
for rus arrangements that do not involve installation services  we recognize revenue in accordance with the revenue recognition policy described above 
stock based compensation we adopted the applicable accounting guidance under asc topic for share based payment transactions using the modified prospective transition method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance  stock based awards are recorded at fair value as of the grant date and recognized to expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period  which we have elected to amortize on a straight line basis 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires various highly judgmental assumptions  including volatility  expected forfeiture rates and expected option life  which have a significant impact on the fair value estimates 
because we are a newly public company  we derive our expected volatility based on our peer group of publicly traded companies in the industry in which we do business 
the expected life of an 
table of contents option award is calculated using the simplified method provided in the sec s staff accounting bulletin  and takes into consideration the grant s contractual life and vesting periods 
we value rsus and rsas at fair value or the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
during the year ended december   we recorded stock based compensation of million 
at december   we had million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options  net of estimated forfeitures 
this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average service period of approximately years 
at december   we had million of total unrecognized stock based compensation cost related to restricted stock units  or rsus  and restricted stock awards or rsas  net of estimated forfeitures 
this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average service period of approximately years 
to the extent that the actual forfeiture rate is different than what we have anticipated  stock based compensation related to these awards will be adjusted in future periods 
the stock based compensation expense decreased for the year ended december   primarily due to the completion of vesting of restricted stock units granted in a company wide stock option exchange program which began amortizing at the date of our ipo on march  and were fully vested and amortized by april restricted stock units in july  our board of directors approved a proposal to offer current employees and directors the opportunity to exchange eligible stock options for restricted stock units  or rsus  on a one for one basis 
each rsu granted in the option exchange entitled the holder to receive one share of our common stock if and when the rsu vests 
the vesting schedule for the rsus was as follows of the rsus vested on the first day the trading window opened for employees that was more than days following the effective date of an ipo  or the first vesting date  which was october   and the remaining of the rsus vested on the first day the trading window opened for employees that was more than days after the first vesting date  which was in april  in each case  subject to the employee or director s continuous service to our company through the vesting date 
however  any unvested rsus become immediately vested prior to the closing of a change in control  subject to the employee or director s continuous service to our company through such date 
the offer was made to eligible option holders on august  and expired on september  only current employees and directors who were providing services to our company as of august  and continued to provide services through september  were eligible to participate 
pursuant to the exchange  we subsequently canceled options for million shares of our common stock and issued an equivalent number of rsus to eligible holders on september  in connection with the rsu grants  the unrecognized compensation expense of million related to the exchanged options was expensed over the remaining period of the original vesting period 
the incremental cost of million due to the exchange was deferred until a liquidation event  which happened with our ipo  and is being recognized in accordance with the vesting period described above 
on december   we granted million rsus to our chief executive officer 
these rsus vest in equal installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of the grant  and vesting was contingent upon the completion of our ipo 
the unrecognized compensation cost related to this grant of million was deferred until the completion of our ipo and has begun recognition in accordance with the vesting period described above 
inventory valuation inventory consisting of finished goods purchased from contract manufacturers is stated at the lower of cost  determined by the first in  first out method  or market value 
we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record write downs for excess and obsolete inventories based on our estimate of demand for our products  potential obsolescence of technology  product life cycles and whether pricing trends or forecasts indicate that the carrying value of inventory exceeds our estimated selling price 
these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions  technology changes and new product introductions and require estimates that may include elements that are uncertain 
actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and may have a material effect on gross margins 
if inventory is written down  a new cost basis is established that cannot be increased in future periods 
the sale of previously reserved inventory has not had a material impact on our gross margins 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments 
we record a specific allowance based on an analysis of individual past due balances 
additionally  based on historical write offs and our collections experience  we record an additional allowance based on a percentage of outstanding receivables 
we perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
these evaluations require significant judgment and are based on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  payment history and a financial review of the customer 
warranty we offer limited warranties for our hardware products for a period of one or five years  depending on the product type 
we recognize estimated costs related to warranty activities as a component of cost of revenue upon product shipment 
the estimates are based on historical product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures 
the recorded amount is adjusted from time to time for specifically identified warranty exposure 
actual warranty expenses are charged against our estimated warranty liability when incurred 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim 
impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets goodwill is not amortized but instead is subject to an annual impairment test  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired 
we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the end of the second quarter of each year 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and  therefore  the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
management has determined that we operate as a single reporting unit and  therefore  evaluates goodwill impairment at the enterprise level 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives  generally four to five years  and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of the end of the second quarter and the estimated fair value of calix significantly exceeded our carrying value at that date 
we updated our evaluation of impairment indicators and have concluded that there was no impairment to the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets as of december  in addition  there were no impairment losses during and we periodically evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may have occurred 
if such events or changes in circumstances arise  we compare the carrying amount of the long lived assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the long lived assets 
if the estimated aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the long lived assets  an impairment charge  calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets  is recorded 
the fair value of the long lived assets is determined based on the estimated discounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long lived assets 
we have updated our evaluation of impairment indicators and have concluded that there was no impairment to our long lived assets during in addition we did not incur any impairment losses for long lived assets during and 
table of contents results of operations for years ended december   and revenue the following table sets forth our revenue years ended december  in thousands revenue our revenue is principally derived in the united states 
during  and revenue generated in the united states represented approximately   and of our revenue  respectively 
compared to revenue increased by million from million in to million in primarily due to an increase in our customer base as a result of the occam acquisition 
our revenue in the second half of the fiscal was impacted by a slowdown in business primarily related to continued delays in broadband stimulus awards under the american recovery and reinvestment act of becoming shippable orders due to challenges that a number of our awarded customers are facing in navigating some of the bureaucratic hurdles of the program 
other factors that contributed to this slowdown include reduced investment in the traditional networks at one of our major customers  the competitive environment  weak macro economic conditions and fiber shortages in certain portions of the market caused by the tsunami in northern japan 
these factors impacted our operating results in the second half of fiscal and we expect some of these issues may continue to impact our operating results in the first half of compared to revenue increased by million from million for to million for primarily from increased product shipment volume  recognition of large deferred revenue balances for one customer and lower revenue deferrals resulting from our adoption of topic on january  which allows us to recognize revenue on partial shipments whereas in years prior to we were required to defer revenue recognition until the order was completely shipped 
cost of revenue and gross profit our cost of revenue is comprised of the following products and services revenue cost of products revenue includes the inventory costs of our products that have shipped  accrued warranty costs for our standard warranty program  outbound freight costs to deliver products to our customers  overhead from our manufacturing operations cost centers  including stock based compensation  and other manufacturing related costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory 
we outsource our manufacturing to third party manufacturers 
inventory costs are estimated using standard costs which reflect the cost of historical direct labor  direct overhead and materials used to build our inventory 
cost of services revenue includes direct installation material costs  direct costs from third party installers  professional service costs  repair fees charged by our outsourced repair contractors to refurbish product returns under an extended warranty or per incident repair agreement  and other miscellaneous costs to support our services 
merger related expenses merger related expenses are primarily  related to inventory acquired from occam that was revalued to its estimated fair value and was amortized to cost of revenue as the inventory was sold 
we amortized million related to the revaluation of inventory during additionally  we incurred charges of million during for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the occam acquisition 
amortization of acquired intangible assets in connection with the acquisitions of occam in and optical solutions inc  or osi  in  we recorded amortizable intangible assets of million and million respectively  which included core developed technologies  purchase order backlog and the trade name 
these amounts are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives 
we recorded amortization expense of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  related to these intangible assets 
the remaining balance of intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of osi was fully amortized during the quarter ended march  
table of contents the following table sets forth our costs of revenue years ended december  in thousands  except percentages cost of revenue products and services merger related expenses amortization of intangible assets total cost of revenue gross profit gross margin compared to cost of revenue increased from million to million for the fiscal compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal  primarily due to an increase in revenues recognized during this period  merger related expenses and the amortization of acquired intangible assets 
in addition we experienced a significant increase in the excess and obsolete inventory reserves in the third quarter of fiscal primarily due to end of life inventory and excess parts held by us and our contract manufacturer 
gross margin decreased during  primarily due to higher merger related expenses and intangible asset amortization when compared to the corresponding period of fiscal during fiscal gross margin decreased primarily due to the merger related expenses primarily related to revaluation of inventory acquired in our acquisition of occam 
excluding merger related expenses and intangible asset amortization  gross margin increased during to from in  primarily due to cost reductions  change in product mix  and within product mix the introduction of many new products in the last year 
compared to cost of revenue increased million from million for to million for  primarily due to an increase in revenues recognized during this period 
gross margin increased from for to for  primarily as a result of reduced product costs  in addition to a change in product and customer mix 

table of contents operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and include personnel costs  consulting services  depreciation on lab equipment  costs of prototypes and overhead allocations 
we generally expense research and development costs as incurred  since the costs of software development that we incur after a product has reached technological feasibility are not material 
we intend to continue making significant investments in developing new products and enhancing the functionality of our existing products 
the following table sets forth our research and development expenses years ended december  in thousands  except percentages research and development percent of total revenue compared to research and development expenses increased million from million for to million for  primarily due to an increase in compensation and related costs  including travel related expenses  from an increase in headcount  and an increase in depreciation and facilities related expenses resulting from the acquisition of occam and the expansion of our china development center 
in addition we also experienced an increase in prototype and consulting expenses related to new product development and our pursuit of osmine certification 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense resulting from rsus granted in a company wide stock option exchange program  which began amortizing at the date of our ipo on march  and were fully vested and related stock based compensation expense recognized by april compared to research and development expenses increased million from million for to million for  primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the rsus received in the exchange program which began vesting in march  an increase in compensation and related costs from an increase in employee headcount in the us and in china  an increase in corporate bonus plan expense  an increase in facilities related expenses and insurance expenses  and an increase in spending on prototypes 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs  employee sales commissions and marketing programs

table of contents working capital and capital expenditure needs except as disclosed in the contractual obligations and commitments section below  we currently have no material cash commitments  except for normal recurring trade payables  expense accruals and operating leases 
in addition  we do not currently anticipate significant investment in property  plant and equipment  and we believe that our outsourced approach to manufacturing provides us significant flexibility in both managing inventory levels and financing our inventory 
we may be required to issue performance bonds to satisfy requirements under our rus contracts 
we issue letters of credit under our existing credit facility to support these performance bonds 
in the event we do not have sufficient capacity under our credit facility to support these bonds  we will have to purchase certificates of deposit  which could materially impact our working capital or limit our ability to satisfy such contract requirements 
there were no restrictions on our cash at december  and in the event that our revenue plan does not meet our expectations  we may eliminate or curtail expenditures to mitigate the impact on our working capital 
we believe based on our current operating plan  our existing cash and cash equivalents  and existing amounts available under our revolving line will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the acquisition of new capabilities or technologies and the continued market acceptance of our products 
in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources  we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed

we have capitalized the full amount of the lease incentive and are amortizing the cost of the improvements over the lease term 
our lease in minneapolis expires in march  our lease in acton expires in june  our lease in richardson expires in october and our lease in nanjing expires in february as of december   the company s cumulative unrecognized tax benefits of million is not included in the above table because this amount is netted against the company s deferred tax asset that is subject to a full valuation allowance 
if any of the unrecognized tax benefits are ultimately recognized  it would result in a reduction to the company s tax attribute carryforwards and would not result in the use of cash to satisfy the liability 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activity are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
by policy  we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
some of the securities in which we invest  however  may be subject to interest rate risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we invest in a variety of securities  which primarily consists of money market funds  us government bonds  commercial paper and other debt securities of domestic corporations 
due to the nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rates also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments 
any outstanding borrowings under our term loan and line of credit bear a variable rate of interest based upon the applicable libor or prime rate and is adjusted monthly based upon changes in the federal reserve s prime rate 
on may   we paid down our outstanding term loan of million  which bore interest at libor not less than plus  in its entirety including outstanding accrued interest and prepayment penalties of million 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
foreign currency risk our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and  therefore  the majority of our revenues are not subject to foreign currency risk 
we are directly exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates to the extent such changes affect our expenses related to our foreign assets and liabilities 
our exposure in regard to our foreign assets and liabilities is with our subsidiary in china and the united kingdom  whose functional currencies is the chinese renminbi and great british pound sterling  respectively 
we are indirectly exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent of our use of foreign contract manufacturers whom we pay in us dollars 
as a result  changes in the local currency rates of these vendors in relation to the us dollar could cause an increase in the price of products that we purchase
