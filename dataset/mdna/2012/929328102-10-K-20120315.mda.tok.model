earnings for were impacted by a lower provision for loan losses which decreased million to million 
in addition  fiduciary and investment management income increased million due to the addition of the christiana trust division in december of partially offsetting these favorable items was an increase of million in noninterest expenses during this increase was due to added operating expenses from the addition of christiana trust as well as overall franchise growth including the addition of five new branches  the relocation of three branches and the addition of twelve commercial relationship managers and related support staff 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  to million in from million in  while the net interest margin remained essentially flat at in compared to in the increase in net interest income was mainly due to million of growth in average loans which increased to billion in during we continued our active deposit pricing management which decreased our average cost of deposits by basis points to in compared to in in addition  federal home loan bank advances were basis points lower in these favorable variances were partially offset by the decrease in our mortgage backed securities portfolio yield of basis points to in compared to in the decrease in mortgage backed securities yields can be attributed to high prepayments and significant sales combined with the continued low rate environment 
the yield on interest earning assets declined by basis points  including loan yields which declined only basis points  while the rate on interest bearing liabilities declined by basis points  including the rate on customer deposits which declined basis points net interest income increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase in net interest income was due to the increase in average earning assets as well as a significant increase in net interest margin 
average earning assets increased million while the net interest margin for was  up basis points from during  loan yields remained stable as the prime rate remained unchanged for a large amount of our variable rate loans 
we were able to reduce our cost of deposits through our active deposit pricing management and a shift toward lower cost core deposits from higher costing cds and wholesale funding compared to the yield on interest earning assets only declined by basis points  including loan yields which declined only basis points  while the rate on interest bearing liabilities declined by basis points  including the rate on customer deposits which declined basis points

provision for loan losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level based on our assessment of the estimable and probable losses in the loan portfolio  pursuant to accounting literature  which is discussed further in the nonperforming assets section of this management s discussion and analysis 
our evaluation is based upon a review of the portfolio and requires significant judgment 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for loan losses of million compared to million in and million in this decrease was due to a number of factors  including the change in our portfolio mix  a decline in impaired loans and the stabilization of the economy and real estate valuations during noninterest income 
noninterest income increased to million in from million in excluding the impact of net securities gains in both periods and million in unanticipated boli income in  noninterest income increased by million  or 
noninterest income increased million in fiduciary and investment management income resulting primarily from the december acquisition of christiana bank trust cb t 
in addition  increases in credit debit card and atm fees and deposit service charges  resulting from increased volume and franchise growth and exceeded year over year declines in mortgage banking revenues 
noninterest income was essentially unchanged at million in compared to million for the million decrease in loan fees in was mainly attributable to the wind down of st reverse financial services  llc during  which produced no loan fees from this business in in addition  net gains on sales of securities decreased by million in compared to  but still reflected million of net gains in despite the sale of nearly all of our downgraded mbs 
increases in several items essentially offset these decreases  including an increase of million in credit debit card and atm income during this increase was primarily due to growth in prime based bailment fees at cash connect our atm division 
in addition  fiduciary and investment management income increased million during resulting from our acquisition of cb t in the fourth quarter of as well as growth of our existing wealth management and investment businesses during the year 
noninterest expenses 
noninterest expense increased to million in from million in excluding the cb t integration costs of  in and million in  noninterest expenses increased by million  or  over during the year  loan workout and oreo expenses increased million and included the impact from bulk sales of oreo and readying other problem assets under agreement of sale for disposition in early marketing expenses also increased by million mainly due to our right here marketing campaign in the third quarter of the remaining increase in expenses over the prior year was the result of normal ongoing operational costs related to the cb t acquisition  organic franchise growth including the opening  relocation and renovation of eight branches  the hiring of additional commercial relationship managers and the full year of impact for adds and related infrastructure and support costs 
noninterest expenses increased  during compared to during there were million of non routine items 
excluding the non routine items  the increase in expenses was the result of higher fdic expense during mainly due to increased deposit balances during the year 
in addition  loan workout and oreo expenses increased  as we continued our active asset disposition efforts and prudent write downs to expected realizable values 
otherwise  increases in expense items reflect the early stages of the thoughtful and aggressive growth efforts we had taken to pursue the significant opportunities in our market 
examples of this growth were increased expenses related to the addition of eight new relationship managers and the related support staff during the year 
further  during we completed five new  relocated or renovated branch offices  as well as made preparations for several additional or renovated offices during income taxes 
we recorded million of tax expense for the year ended december  compared to tax expense of million and a tax benefit of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
the and expense reflect tax benefits of  and  respectively  resulting from net reductions in unrecognized tax benefits for those years 
the tax benefit is a result of our pre tax operating loss  combined with tax free income and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits during the year 
volatility in effective tax rates is impacted by the level of pretax income or loss  combined with the amount of tax free income as well as the effects of unrecognized tax benefits 
the provision for income taxes includes federal  state and local income taxes that are currently payable or deferred because of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax reporting basis of the assets and liabilities 
financial condition total assets increased million  or to billion as of december  compared to billion as of december  included in this increase was a million  or  increase in net loans  and a million  or  increase in investments in mortgage backed securities 
in addition  we had a million increase in cash and cash equivalents  mainly due to higher cash balances in non owned atms from our cash connect division 
total liabilities increased million during the year to billion at december  this increase was primarily the result of an increase in customer deposits of million  or 
cash in non owned atms 
during  cash in non owned atms managed by cash connect  our atm unit  increased million  or 
cash connect serviced nearly  atms at december  of which more than were wsfs owned and were operated to serve customers in our markets 
mortgage backed securities 
investments in mortgage backed securities increased million to million during purchases of million were partially offset by sales and paydowns of million during our mortgage backed securities are predominantly of short duration with a weighted average duration of years at december  investment securities 
our investment securities are comprised mostly of government sponsored entities gse securities with maturities of less than four years 
we own no collateralized debt obligations  bank trust preferred  agency preferred securities or equity securities in other fdic insured banks or thrifts 
loans  net 
net loans including those held for sale increased million  or  during loan growth included increases of million  or  in commercial and industrial loans 
this increase was partially offset by the intentional decline of million  or  in construction loan balances during in addition  residential mortgage loans decreased by million  or  mainly due to our strategy to originate then sell these loans in the secondary market to generate fee income 
goodwill and intangibles 
goodwill and intangibles remained essentially flat during customer deposits 
customer deposits increased million  or  during to billion 
core deposit relationships demand deposits  money market and savings accounts increased million  or  during the year 
jumbo certificates of deposits increased million  or  and customer time deposits cds under  decreased million  or  in the table below depicts the changes in customer deposits during the last three years year ended december  dollars in millions beginning balance interest credited deposit inflows  net ending balance borrowings and brokered deposits 
borrowing and brokered deposits increased by million  or  during included in the increase was million  or  of brokered deposits and million  or  in federal home loan bank advances 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of million  or  in other borrowed funds and million  or  in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity increased million  or  to million at december  retained earnings increased million  or  to million as a result of earnings from the year less dividends paid 
in addition  other comprehensive income increased million  or  during  due to an increase in unrealized gains on available for sale securities 
asset liability management our primary asset liability management goal is to optimize long term net interest income opportunities within the constraints of managing interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity and funding and maintaining a strong capital base 
in general  interest rate risk is mitigated by closely matching the maturities or repricing periods of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to ensure a favorable interest rate spread 
we regularly review our interest rate sensitivity  and use a variety of strategies as needed to adjust that sensitivity within acceptable tolerance ranges established by management and the board of directors 
changing the relative proportions of fixed rate and adjustable rate assets and liabilities is one of our primary strategies to accomplish this objective 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring our interest sensitivity gap 
an interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a defined period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing within a defined period 
for additional information related to interest rate sensitivity  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the repricing and maturities of our interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities at december  are shown in the following table less than one to over total one year five years five years dollars in thousands interest rate sensitive assets commercial loans real estate loans mortgage backed securities consumer loans investment securities loans held for sale interest rate sensitive liabilities money market and interest bearing demand deposits retail certificates of deposits fhlb advances savings deposits brokered certificates of deposit other borrowed funds jumbo certificates of deposit ira certificates of deposit trust preferred borrowings total interest sensitive liabilities deficiency excess of interest rate sensitive assets over interest rate liabilities interest rate sensitive gap one year interest rate sensitive assets interest rate sensitive liabilities one year interest rate sensitive gap as a percent of total assets includes commercial mortgage  construction  and residential mortgage loans loan balances exclude nonaccruing loans  deferred fees and costs generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling rates  a positive gap would result in a decrease in net interest income while a negative gap would augment net interest income 
however  the interest sensitivity table does not provide a comprehensive representation of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
each category of assets or liabilities will not be affected equally or simultaneously by changes in the general level of interest rates 
even assets and liabilities which contractually reprice within the rate period may not  in fact  reprice at the same price  at the same time or with the same frequency 
it is also important to consider that the table represents a specific point in time 
variations can occur as we adjust our interest sensitivity position throughout the year 
to provide a more accurate position of our one year gap  certain deposit classifications are based on the interest rate sensitive attributes and not on the contractual repricing characteristics of these deposits 
we estimate  based on historical trends of our deposit accounts  that of our money market deposits  of our interest bearing demand deposits and of our savings deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes 
accordingly  these interest sensitive portions are classified in the less than one year category with the remainder in the over five years category 
deposit rates other than time deposit rates are variable 
changes in deposit rates are generally subject to local market conditions and our discretion and are not indexed to any particular rate 
reverse mortgages we hold an investment in reverse mortgages of  at december  representing a second lien participation in reverse mortgages with a third party 
these loans were originated in the early s 
these reverse mortgage loans are contracts that require the lender to make monthly advances throughout each borrower s life or until each borrower relocates  prepays or the home is sold  at which time the loan becomes due and payable 
reverse mortgages are nonrecourse obligations  which means that the loan repayments are generally limited to the net sale proceeds of the borrower s residence 
we account for our investment in reverse mortgages by estimating the value of the future cash flows on the reverse mortgages at a rate deemed appropriate for these mortgages  based on the market rate for similar collateral 
actual cash flows from these mortgage loans can result in volatility in the recorded value of reverse mortgage assets 
as a result  income varies significantly from reporting period to reporting period 
for the year ended december   we recorded a negative  in interest income on reverse mortgages as compared to a negative  in and a negative  in the results for all three years were primarily due to the decrease in the values of the properties securing these mortgages  based on annual re evaluation and generally consistent with the decrease in home values over the past three years 
the projected cash flows depend on assumptions about life expectancy of the mortgagees and the future changes in collateral values 
projecting the changes in collateral values is one of the factors affecting the volatility of reverse mortgage values 
the current assumptions include a short term annual depreciation rate of zero in the first year  and a long term annual appreciation rate of in future years 
if the long term appreciation rate was increased or decreased by  the impact on income would not be material 
we also hold million fair value in bbb rated mortgage backed securities classified as trading 
further  we have class o certificates issued in connection with securities consisting of a portfolio of reverse mortgages we previously owned 
on july   we purchased of the sasco rm class o certificates for million from a third party 
as of december   the market value of the sasco rm o securities was million  with  of this change in market value reflected in interest income and the remaining million in other comprehensive income 
a model from the bank s reverse mortgage consultant uses the income approach as described in asc the model is a present value cash flow model  consistent with asc which describes the components of a present value measurement 
the model incorporates the projected cash flows of the notes and then discounts these cash flows using a rate that is commensurate with the risk adjusted rate 
the inputs to the model reflect our expectations of what other market participants would use in pricing this asset in a current transaction and therefore is consistent with asc that sets out an exit price methodology for determining fair value 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets  which include nonaccruing loans  nonperforming real estate investments and assets acquired through foreclosure and troubled debt restructurings  can negatively affect our results of operations 
nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if  in the opinion of management  collection is doubtful  or when principal or interest is past due days or more and the value of the collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest 
interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and charged against interest income 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of the ultimate collectability of principal and interest 
past due loans are defined as loans contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest payments but which remain in accrual status because they are considered well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table shows our nonperforming assets and past due loans at the dates indicated at december  dollars in thousands nonaccruing loans commercial mortgages construction commercial residential mortgages consumer total nonaccruing loans assets acquired through foreclosure restructured loans total nonperforming assets past due loans residential mortgages commercial and commercial mortgages consumer total past due loans ratio of nonaccruing loans to total loans ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of loan loss allowance to nonaccruing loans accruing loans  nonaccruing tdrs are included in their respective categories of nonaccruing loans 
total loans exclude loans held for sale 
nonperforming assets decreased million from december  to december  as a result of decreases and asset growth  nonperforming assets as a ratio of total assets decreased to at december  from at december  this decrease was mainly due to a reduction in nonperforming construction loans of million and a million decrease in residential and consumer nonperforming loans 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in new commercial mortgage and c i nonperforming loans of million and million  respectively 
in addition  assets acquired through foreclosure increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  the overall decrease in nonperforming assets is a result of our proactive credit management and active resolution of problem assets 
however  while we have seen some improvement in nonperforming assets and their related loan workout and oreo costs  future balances and related costs are expected to be volatile as a result of the current economic conditions 
our accruing restructured loans at december  increased to million compared to million at december  concessions on these loans consisted mainly of forbearance agreements  reduction in interest rates and extensions of maturities 
nonaccruing restructured loans remain in nonaccrual status until there has been a period of sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable period  usually six months 
the following table provides an analysis of the change in the balance of nonperforming assets during the last three years year ended december  in thousands beginning balance additions collections transfers to accrual charge offs write downs ending balance as of december   we had million of loans  which although performing at that date  required increased supervision and review  and may  depending on the economic environment and other factors  become nonperforming assets in future periods 
the amount of such loans at december  was million 
the majority of these loans are secured by commercial real estate  with others being secured by residential real estate  inventory and receivables 
at december   we did not have a material amount of loans not classified as non accrual  days past due or restructured but where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused us to have serious concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and may result in disclosure as non accrual  days past due or restructured 
allowance for loan losses 
we maintain allowances for loan losses and charge losses to these allowances when such losses are realized 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment reflecting our best estimate of impairment related to specifically identified loans as well as probable loan losses in the remaining loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon a continuing review of these portfolios 
the formula allowances for commercial loans are calculated by applying estimated loss factors to outstanding loans based on the internal risk grade of loans 
for low risk commercial and commercial real estate loans the portfolio is pooled  based on internal risk grade  and  as a starting point  estimates are generally based on a five year net charge off history 
higher risk and criticized loans have loss factors that are derived from an analysis of both the probability of default and the estimate of loss should default occur 
loss adjustment factors are then applied to the historical data based on criteria discussed below 
as a result  changes in risk grades of both performing and nonperforming loans affect the amount of the formula allowance 
pooled loans are usually smaller  not individually graded and homogeneous in nature  such as consumer installment loans and residential mortgages 
loan loss allowances for pooled loans are first based on a five year net charge off history 
the average loss percentage per homogeneous pool is based on the product of the average annual historical loss rate and the homogeneous pool balances 
these separate risk pools are then assigned a reserve for losses based upon the expected duration of that pool and this historical loss information and loss adjustment factors 
adjustments to historical losses are based upon our evaluation of various current conditions including those listed below general economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas credit quality trends recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio collateral values and loan to value ratios loan volumes and concentrations  including changes in mix seasoning of the loan portfolio specific industry conditions within portfolio segments bank regulatory examination results other factors  including changes in quality of the loan origination  servicing and risk management processes our loan officers and risk managers meet at least quarterly to discuss and review the conditions and risks associated with certain individual loans 
we also have an internal loan review function that oversees and examines our internal ratings 
we have an internal loan rating system with twelve categories of loan ratings  which is used to evaluate our commercial loans 
specific reserves are established  when appropriate  for certain loans in cases where we have identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a specific credit that we believe indicate the loan is impaired 
we analyze all loans for impairment in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc  receivables formerly sfas no 
 accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan 
the impairment adjustments are made in the form of a related reserve and or charge offs 
for additional information related to the allowance for loan losses  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we regularly contract with third party loan review experts to review portions of the portfolio 
further  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for such losses 
we also give consideration to the results of these regulatory agency examinations 
we established our loan loss allowance in accordance with guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab 
its methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements which include specific allowances for identified problem loans  formula allowances for commercial and commercial real estate loans  and allowances for pooled homogeneous loans 
during  changes to our allowance for loan loss methodology included a reduction in our business cycle periods from ten years to five years 
as a result of this change  we also revised our adjustment factors to include the impact of this shorter credit cycle 
further  we completed a risk recalibration project with a goal of recalibrating our loan rating classifications to current office of the controller of the currency and federal reserve board standards discussed further under credit quality indicators in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the combined impact of these changes did not have a material impact on the allowance for loan loss during the table below represents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses during the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands beginning balance provision for loan losses charge offs commercial mortgage construction commercial residential real estate overdrafts consumer total charge offs recoveries commercial mortgage construction commercial residential real estate overdrafts consumer total recoveries net charge offs ending balance net charge offs to average gross loans outstanding  net of unearned income commercial recoveries for the year ended december include a one time adjustment for the reclassification of an unfunded commitment reserve previously included in the allowance for loan loss to a liability reserve account 
the allowance for loan losses decreased million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december  during  net charge offs were essentially unchanged at million or  of average loans 
this compares to net charge offs for the year ended december  of million or of average loans 
the allowance for loan losses is allocated by major portfolio type 
as these portfolios have developed  they have become a source of historical data in projecting delinquencies and loss exposure 
however  such allocations are not a guarantee of when future losses may occur 
while we have allocated the allowance for loan losses by portfolio type in the following table  the entire reserve is available for any loan category to utilize

historically  we have had success in growing our loan portfolio 
for example  during the year ended december   net loan growth resulted in the use of million in cash 
loan growth was primarily the result of our continued success increasing corporate and small business lending 
we expect this trend to continue and have significant experience managing our funding needs through borrowings and deposit growth 
as a financial institution  we have ready access to several sources of funding 
among these are deposit growth brokered deposits borrowing from the fhlb federal reserve discount window access other borrowings such as repurchase agreements cash flow from securities  loan sales and repayments net income our recent branch expansion and renovation program has been focused on expanding our retail footprint in delaware and the surrounding area and attracting new customers in part to provide additional deposit growth 
customer deposit growth deposits excluding brokered cds increased million  or  from december  to december  all of this growth was in core deposit accounts and was partially offset by a decrease in customer time and sweep accounts 
our portfolio of high quality liquid investments  primarily short duration  mortgage backed securities and gse securities also provide a source of cash flow to meet current cash needs in addition to normal cash flows from paydowns in these securities 
if needed  portions of this portfolio  as well as portions of the loan portfolio  could be sold to provide cash to fund new loans 
in addition  during the year ended december   million in cash was provided by operating activities 
we have a policy that separately addresses liquidity  and we monitor our adherence to policy limits 
as part of the liquidity management process  we also monitor our available wholesale funding capacity 
at december   we had million in funding capacity at the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh 
also  liquidity risk management is a primary area of examination by the banking regulators 
we have not used  and have no intention of using  any significant off balance sheet financing arrangement for liquidity management purposes 
our financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are limited to obligations to fund loans to customers pursuant to existing commitments  obligations of letters of credit and swap guarantees 
in addition  we have not had  and have no intention of having  any significant transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated  limited purpose entities that could materially affect our liquidity or capital resources 
capital resources under guidelines issued by banking regulators  savings institutions such as the bank must maintain tangible capital equal to of adjusted total assets  core capital equal to of adjusted total assets  tier capital equal to of risk weighted assets and total or risk based capital a combination of core and supplementary capital equal to of risk weighted assets 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory actions and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial statements 
in light of the current economic conditions  we feel it is appropriate to hold a capital cushion well in excess of these limits 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia  as well as other requirements  established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  under capitalized  significantly under capitalized  and critically under capitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier depends upon its capital levels in relation to various relevant capital measures  which include leverage and risk based capital measures and certain other factors 
depository institutions that are not classified as well capitalized are subject to various restrictions regarding capital distributions  payment of management fees  acceptance of brokered deposits and other operating activities 
at december   we are classified as well capitalized  the highest regulatory defined level  and in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements 
additional information concerning our regulatory capital compliance is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
since  the board of directors has approved several stock repurchase programs to acquire common stock outstanding 
we did not acquire any shares in or at december   we held million shares of our common stock as treasury shares 
at december   we had  shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorization  although  as discussed below  due to our participation in the capital purchase plan  we cannot repurchase any shares without the prior approval of the us treasury 
in  under the us treasury s capital purchase plan cpp  we issued and sold  shares of senior preferred stock to the us treasury  having a liquidation amount equal to  per share  or million  as well as a year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of 
as part of the cpp program  any share repurchases or increase in the dividend level from the september quarterly payment of per share  must be approved by the us treasury 
additional information concerning the cpp is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we completed a private placement to peninsula investment partners  lp peninsula in  pursuant to which we issued and sold  shares of common stock for a total purchase price of million  and a year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
during  as part of dissolution of peninsula  all shares were distributed on a pro rata basis to the fund holders of peninsula with the warrants being transferred to peninsula s managing partner 
additional information concerning the peninsula transaction is included in note to the consolidated financial statements

off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that currently have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations at december   we had contractual obligations relating to operating leases  long term debt  data processing and credit obligations 
these obligations are summarized below 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
total less than one to three to five years over one year three years years in thousands operating lease obligations long term debt obligations data processing contracts credit obligations total impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or the same extent as the price of goods and services 
recent legislation on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law by president obama 
the arra includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health  and education needs

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions including those related to the allowance for loan losses  deferred taxes  fair value measurements  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgments on the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are critical accounting policies that involve more significant judgments and estimates 
for additional information on these policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses we maintain allowances for loan losses and charge losses to these allowances when realized 
we consider the determination of the allowance for loan losses to be critical because it requires significant judgment reflecting our best estimate of impairment related to specifically evaluated impaired loans as well as the inherent risk of loss for those in the remaining loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon a continuing review of the portfolio  with consideration given to evaluations resulting from examinations performed by regulatory authorities 
deferred taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  income taxes asc  which requires the recording of deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we consider our accounting policies on deferred taxes to be critical because we regularly assess the need for valuation allowances on deferred income tax assets that may result from  among other things  limitations imposed by internal revenue code and uncertainties  including the timing of settlement and realization of these differences 
no valuation allowance is required as of december  fair value measurements we adopted fasb asc fair value measurements and disclosures asc  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we consider our accounting policies related to fair value measurements to be critical because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and they require our subjective and complex judgment as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
see note  fair value of financial assets to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets resulting from acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting consist of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized and is subject to at least annual assessments for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we review goodwill annually and again at any quarter end if a material event occurs during the quarter that may affect goodwill 
this review evaluates potential impairment by determining if our fair value has fallen below carrying value 
other intangible assets consist mainly of core deposits and covenants not to compete obtained through acquisitions and are amortized over their estimated lives using the present value of the benefit of the core deposits and straight line methods of amortization 
core deposit intangibles are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued an update accounting standards update asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements impacting fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
the update provides clarification regarding existing disclosures and requires additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
specifically  the guidance now requires reporting entities to disclose the amounts of significant transfers between levels and the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  the reconciliation should present separate information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value 
the new standard was effective for reporting periods beginning after december  except for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements which were not effective until reporting periods beginning after december  there was no transfer into or out of level or level of the fair value hierarchy in the first nine months of adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment to give entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the matching of maturities or repricing periods of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to promote a favorable interest rate spread and mitigate exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is our primary tool for achieving our asset liability management strategies 
we regularly review our interest rate sensitivity and adjust the sensitivity within our acceptable tolerance ranges 
at december  interest earning assets exceeded interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within one year interest sensitive gap by approximately million 
our interest sensitive assets as a percentage of interest sensitive liabilities within one year decreased from at december  to at december  likewise  the one year interest sensitive gap as a percentage of total assets changed to at december  from at december  the change in sensitivity since december  was the result of the current interest rate environment and our continuing effort to effectively manage interest rate risk 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing and funding activities 
to that end  we actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure 
the following table is the estimated impact of immediate changes in interest rates on our net interest margin and economic value of equity at the specified levels at december  and at december  change in change in change in interest rate net interest economic value net interest economic value basis points margin of equity margin of equity nmf nmf nm f nmf nmf nmf nm f nmf the percentage difference between net interest margin in a stable interest rate environment and net interest margin as projected under the various rate change environments 
the economic value of equity ratio in a stable interest rate environment and the economic value of equity projected under the various rate change environments 
sensitivity indicated by a decrease of and basis points is deemed not meaningful nmf given the low absolute level of interest rates at that time 
our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital  while maximizing the yield cost spread on our asset liability structure 
we rely primarily on our asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
we also engage in other business activities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for example  mortgage banking revenues and expenses can fluctuate with changing interest rates 
these fluctuations are difficult to model and estimate
