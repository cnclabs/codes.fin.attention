item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a development stage  specialty pharmaceutical and medical device company focused on oncology  initially cancers in the liver 
since our inception  we have directed our research efforts towards the development and clinical study of the delcath chemosaturation system 
the delcath chemosaturation system allows the administration of concentrated regional chemotherapy by isolating the circulatory system of the targeted organ 
once the organ is isolated  the delcath chemosaturation system delivers high doses of chemotherapeutic agents directly to the liver  while limiting systemic exposure and the related side effects by filtering the blood prior to returning it to the patient 
the delcath chemosaturation system involves a series of three catheter insertions  each of which is placed percutaneously through standard interventional radiology techniques 
the procedure is minimally invasive and repeatable allowing for multiple courses of treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs and the potential for concomitant cancer therapies 
we believe that the delcath chemosaturation system is a platform technology that may have broader applicability  including the use of other drugs to treat the liver  as well as for the treatment of cancers in other organs and regions of the body 
on april   we obtained the right to affix the ce mark to the delcath hepatic chemosat delivery system chemosat system 
the right to affix the ce mark allows us to market and sell the chemosat system in the european economic area eea 
in the eea  the chemosat system is regulated as a medical device indicated for the intra arterial administration of chemotherapeutic agent melphalan hydrochloride to the liver with additional extracorporeal filtration of the venous blood return 
we have filed an application seeking ce marking for generation of our chemosaturation system with melphalan as an amendment to the original ce mark for the chemosat system and that application is currently under review with the notified body 
we believe the chemosat system may ultimately fulfill an annual unmet clinical need for as many as  liver cancer patients in the eea 
we intend to focus our initial efforts on seven target markets including germany  united kingdom  france  the netherlands  italy  spain and ireland 
we believe these countries represent a majority of the total potential liver cancer market in eea countries 
we plan to use a combination of direct and indirect sales channels to market and distribute the chemosat system in the eea 
our european commercialization strategy involves the establishment of clinical training and centers of excellence to educate and train physicians in these countries in order to develop key opinion thought leadership and foster initial market acceptance 
to support our commercialization efforts in the eea  we have established our european headquarters in galway  ireland 
on november  we announced that we had entered into an initial training and marketing agreement with the european institute of oncology ieo in milan  italy 
we have also entered into initial training and marketing agreements with the frankfurt university hospital in frankfurt  germany  as well as with university medical center schleswig holstein in kiel  germany 
in february  we commenced our first european patient treatments with the chemosat system at ieo in italy and frankfurt university hospital in germany 
the initial patients involved were treated for inoperable liver dominant metastases from ocular melanoma  cutaneous melanoma  breast cancer and gastric cancer 
we plan to add additional cancer centers in france  the united kingdom  netherlands and ireland in the near future 

table of contents in the united states  the delcath chemosaturation system for the administration of melphalan hydrochloride is considered a combination drug and device product and is regulated as a drug by the united states food and drug administration fda 
in december  we submitted our section b new drug application nda  to the fda  seeking an indication for the percutaneous intra arterial administration of melphalan for use in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma in the liver 
in february  we received a refusal to file rtf letter from the fda for the nda 
the fda will issue an rtf if it determines  upon an initial review  that the nda is not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review 
neither the acceptance nor non acceptance of an nda for filing is a determination of the ultimate approvability of the drug product at issue 
the rtf requested information on a number of items  including manufacturing plant inspection timing  product and sterilization validations  statistical analysis clarification concerning randomization and additional safety information regarding patient hospitalization data in order to allow the fda to properly assess the risk benefit profile of the product candidate 
on january   we held a pre nda meeting with the fda to discuss our nda submission and provide an update on the items identified in the rtf 
based upon the meeting and fda correspondence received in response to our meeting request and the briefing packet we submitted  we are satisfied with the responses that we received from the fda to certain questions we had regarding the nda submission 
accordingly  we will continue with the preparation of our nda submission as planned and expect to make the submission in the second quarter of liquidity and capital resources our future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
the company has operated at a loss for its entire history and anticipates that losses will continue over the coming year 
there can be no assurance that delcath will ever generate significant revenues or achieve profitability 
the company expects to use cash  cash equivalents and investment proceeds to fund its operating activities 
delcath s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of research and product development programs  obtaining approvals and complying with regulations  the timing and effectiveness of product commercialization activities  including marketing arrangements  the timing and costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  as compared to million at december  approximately million of our funds were invested in money markets at december  in addition  the company had million in certificates of deposit at december  as compared to million at december  at december   cash  cash equivalents and certificates of deposit totaled million as compared to million at december  during the twelve months ended december   delcath used million of cash in our operating activities 
this amount compares to million used in our operating activities during the comparable twelve month period ended december  the increase of million  or  is primarily due to our preparations to commercialize the delcath chemosaturation system  expenses related to our remonitoring efforts to prepare our submission to the fda  and an increase in compensation related expenses as the company grew from to employees during the company expects that cash allocated to operating activities will continue to increase as delcath continues its commercialization efforts in europe  continues to navigate extensive regulatory processes across the globe  and initiates new clinical trials 
the company believes it has access to sufficient capital to fund our operating activities through at december   the company s deficit accumulated during the development stage was approximately million  as compared to million at december  because our business does not generate positive cash flow from operating activities  the company will need to raise additional capital in order to fully commercialize our product or to fund development efforts relating to additional indications 
the company anticipates it will be able to raise additional capital in the event that it is in its best interest to do so 
the company anticipates raising such additional capital by either borrowing money  selling shares of our capital stock  or entering into strategic alliances with appropriate partners 
to the extent additional capital is not available when needed  the company may be forced to abandon some or all of its development and commercialization efforts  which would have a material adverse effect on the prospects of the business 
further  our assumptions relating to our cash requirements may differ materially from our actual requirements because of a number of factors  including significant unforeseen delays in the regulatory approval process  changes in the focus and direction of our clinical trials and costs related to commercializing the delcath chemosaturation system 
in march  the company filed a registration statement on form s with the sec  which allows the company to offer and sell  from time to time in one or more offerings  up to  of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  debt securities and stock purchase contracts as it deems prudent or necessary to raise capital at a later date 
the registration statement became effective on april  
the company used this registration statement for its august and july public offerings detailed in note of the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k and for establishing an at the market equity offering program detailed in note of the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the company has funded our operations through a combination of private placements of our securities and through the proceeds of our public offerings in    and  along with our registered direct offerings in and as of december   delcath had approximately  aggregate amount of common stock  preferred stock  stock purchase contracts  warrants and debt securities or a combination of these securities available to be issued under our effective registration statement on form s the company intends to use the net proceeds from any future offerings for general corporate purposes  including  but not limited to  obtaining regulatory approvals  commercialization of our products  funding of our clinical trials  capital expenditures and working capital 
for a detailed discussion of our various sales of securities and our at the market equity offering program see note and note  respectively  in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 

table of contents in december  the company filed an additional registration statement on form s with the sec  which allows the company to offer and sell  from time to time in one or more offerings  up to  of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  debt securities and stock purchase contracts as it deems prudent or necessary to raise capital at a later date 
the registration statement became effective on february  
contractual obligations  commercial commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as long term research and development agreement obligations and lease agreements 
the following table provides a summary of significant contractual obligations at december  in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating activities research activities operating leases the principal goal of delcath s cooperative research and development agreement crada with the nci is to continue the development of a novel form of regional cancer therapy by designing clinical protocols utilizing the delcath chemosaturation system to regionally deliver chemotherapeutics to patients with unresectable malignancies confined to an organ or region of the body 
under the terms of the agreement  delcath pays  per year to the nci for clinical support 
these funds are payable in quarterly amounts of  and are used for material support of the crada including equipment  supplies  travel  and other related crada support  as well as for support of existing or new scientific or clinical staff to be hired by nci who are to perform work under the crada 
our operating lease obligations at december  include the annual rent under the lease for our office space at seventh avenue  new york  new york  which will expire in november   the annual rent under the leases for our facilities in queensbury  new york  which expire in july  august and november   and the annual rent for our facilities in galway  ireland  which will expire in february and august see part i  item  properties and note of the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
future capital needs  additional future funding our future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
the company has operated at a loss for its entire history and there can be no assurance that it will ever achieve consistent profitability 
the company believes that it has access to adequate resources to fund operations through and anticipates that additional working capital may be required to continue our operations 
there can be no assurance that such working capital will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
results of operations for the year ended december   comparisons of results of the years ended december  and delcath has operated at a loss for its entire history 
the company had a net loss for the year ended december   of million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the net loss from continuing operations for the same period in this decrease is primarily due to a million change in the fair value of the warrant liability  which is a non cash expense  which was offset by a million increase in operating costs 
the increase in operating expenses reflects a significant increase in costs related to our preparations to commercialize the delcath chemosaturation system  expenses related to our additional safety data collection efforts to prepare our submission to the fda  and an increase in compensation related expenses as the company grew from to employees during the warrants issued in and as part of our sales of common stock are considered to be derivatives and are subject to valuation and adjustment on a quarterly basis see item a  below for a complete description 
this mark to market adjustment of the warrant valuation resulted in the recording of million in derivative instrument income for the year ended december   a million difference from the million of derivative instrument expense recorded in the year ended december  
table of contents delcath had a net loss for the year ended december   of million  an increase of million  or  compared to the net loss from continuing operations for the same period in this increase was primarily due to a million increase in operating costs and a million increase in derivative instrument expense 
the increase in operating expenses reflected an increase in costs related to our regulatory filings  as well as an increase in compensation related expenses as the company grew from to employees during general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased to million from million for the year ended december  the company is continuing its transition from a development stage company to a commercial enterprise with staff dedicated to commercializing the delcath chemosaturation system 
the increase in the company s general and administrative expenses corresponds with the initiation of our european commercialization efforts  as well as an increase in staffing in both the united states and europe 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased to million from million for the year ended december  the company continued its progress in transitioning from a development stage company focused solely on research and development activities to a commercial enterprise with staff dedicated to the future commercialization of the delcath chemosaturation system 
the increase in the company s general and administrative expenses was commensurate with those commercialization efforts 
a significant portion of this increase was related to the expansion of our marketing and sales  finance  and manufacturing departments resulting in increased compensation and related overhead expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses is primarily related to our expanded research and development activities  including work on our generation filter and regulatory expenses related to our submission to the fda 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased to million from million for the year ended december  the company s hiring contributed to a marked increase in research and development expenses 
throughout  delcath expanded both its research and development and regulatory and quality assurance departments 
additionally  delcath focused substantial efforts on submissions for fda approval and ce marking of the delcath chemosaturation system 
interest income interest income shown is from our money market account  treasury bills and investment in various certificates of deposit 
for the year ended december   the company had interest income of  as compared to interest income of  for the same period in for the year ended december   the company earned interest from certificates of deposit which matured throughout and the first quarter of  yielding lower interest income for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the company had interest income of  as compared to interest income of  for the same period in this decrease was due to the overall market conditions which continued to yield a lower percentage of return on investments 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
certain accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item contain a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
delcath is still in the development stage and has no revenues  trade receivables  inventories  or significant fixed or intangible assets  and therefore have very limited opportunities to choose among accounting policies or methods 
in many cases  the company must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under gaap 
additionally  the company devotes substantial resources to obtaining regulatory approvals for the delcath chemosaturation system as well as our research and development activities  the cost of which is required to be charged to expense as incurred 
this further limits our choice of accounting policies and methods 
similarly  management believes there are very limited circumstances in which our consolidated financial statement estimates are significant or critical 

table of contents the company considers the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets to be a significant accounting estimate 
in applying the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc  management estimates future taxable income from operations and tax planning strategies in determining if it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
management believes the company does not have any uncertain tax positions 
the company has adopted the provisions of fasb asc  which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services 
under the provisions of fasb asc  share based compensation is measured at the grant date  based upon the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the option holders requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
the company expenses its share based compensation under the ratable method  which treats each vesting tranche as if it were an individual grant 
the company has adopted the provisions of fasb asc  which establishes accounting for equity based payments to non employees 
measurement of compensation cost related to common shares issued to non employees for services is based on the value of the services provided or the fair value of the shares issued 
each transaction is reviewed to determine the more reliably measurable basis for the valuation 
the measurement of non employee stock based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instrument vests 
non employee stock based compensation charges are amortized over the vesting period or period of performance of the services 
the company has adopted the provisions of fasb asc  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fasb asc emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
therefore  a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  fasb asc establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels and of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level of the hierarchy 
level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk delcath may be exposed to market risk through changes in market interest rates that could affect the value of our investments 
however  the company s marketable securities consist of short term and or variable rate instruments and  therefore  a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income 
the company measures all derivatives  including certain derivatives embedded in contracts  at fair value and recognizes them on the balance sheet as an asset or a liability  depending on the company s rights and obligations under the applicable derivative contract 
in june  the company completed the sale of  shares of its common stock and the issuance of warrants to purchase  common shares the warrants in a subscription agreement with a single investor 
the company received gross proceeds of million  with net cash proceeds after related expenses from this transaction of approximately million 
of those proceeds  the company allocated an estimated fair value of million to the warrants  resulting in net proceeds of million 
the fair value of the warrants on june  was determined by using an option pricing model assuming a risk free interest rate of  volatility of and an expected life equal to the contractual life of the warrants june 
the warrants are currently exercisable at per share with  shares outstanding at december  and have a five year term 

table of contents in september  the company completed the sale of  shares of its common stock and the issuance of warrants to purchase  common shares the warrants in a private placement to institutional and accredited investors 
the company received net proceeds of million in this transaction 
the company allocated million of the total proceeds to the warrants 
the warrants were initially exercisable at per share beginning six months after the issuance thereof and on or prior to the fifth anniversary of the issuance thereof 
as required by the warrant agreement  both the exercise price and number of warrants were adjusted following the company s june  sale of common stock 
the warrants are currently exercisable at per share with  warrants outstanding at december  the million in proceeds allocated to the warrants and the million in proceeds allocated to the warrants are classified as derivative instrument liabilities 
the terms of the warrants and the warrants provide for potential adjustment in the exercise price and are therefore considered to be derivative instrument liabilities that are subject to mark to market adjustment each period 
as a result  for the twelve month period ended december   the company recorded pre tax derivative instrument income of million 
the resulting derivative instrument liabilities totaled million at december  management expects that the warrants will either be exercised or expire worthless  at which point the then existing derivative liability will be credited to stockholders equity 
the fair value of the warrants at december  was determined by using an option pricing model assuming a risk free interest rate of for the warrants and for the warrants  volatility of for the warrants and for the warrants and an expected life equal to the contractual life of the warrants june and september  respectively
