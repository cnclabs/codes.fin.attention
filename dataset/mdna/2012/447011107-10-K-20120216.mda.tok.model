table of contents polyurethanes general we are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of polyurethane chemicals  including mdi products  po  polyols  pg and tpu 
polyurethane chemicals are used to produce rigid and flexible foams  as well as coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers 
we focus on the higher margin  higher growth markets for mdi and mdi based polyurethane systems 
growth in our polyurethanes segment has been driven primarily by the continued substitution of mdi based products for other materials across a broad range of applications 
we operate primary polyurethanes manufacturing facilities in the us  europe and china 
we also operate polyurethanes formulation facilities  which are located in close proximity to our customers worldwide 
our customers produce polyurethane products through the combination of an isocyanate  such as mdi or tdi  with polyols  which are derived largely from po and eo 
while the range of tdi based products is relatively limited  we are able to produce over  distinct mdi based polyurethane products by modifying the mdi molecule through varying the proportion and type of polyol used and by introducing other chemical additives to our mdi formulations 
as a result  polyurethane products  especially those derived from mdi  are continuing to replace traditional products in a wide range of end use markets  including insulation in construction and appliances  cushioning for automotive and furniture  adhesives  wood binders  footwear and other specialized engineering applications 
we are one of three north american producers of po 
we and some of our customers process po into derivative products  such as polyols for polyurethane products  pg and various other chemical products 
end uses for these derivative products include applications in the home furnishings  construction  appliances  packaging  automotive and transportation  food  paints and coatings and cleaning products industries 
we also produce mtbe as a co product of our po manufacturing process 
mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
see environmental  health and safety matters mtbe developments below 
in  we were the first global supplier of polyurethane chemicals to open a technical service center in china 
we have since expanded this facility to include an integrated polyurethanes formulation facility 
in january  we entered into two related joint ventures to build mdi production and finishing facilities near shanghai  china 
production at our mdi finishing plant near shanghai  china operated by hps  a consolidated joint venture  was commissioned on june  production at the mnb  aniline and crude mdi plants operated by slic  an unconsolidated joint venture  commenced on september  these world scale facilities strengthen our ability to service our customers in the critical chinese market and will support the significant demand growth that we believe this region will continue to experience 

table of contents products and markets mdi is used primarily in rigid foam applications and in a wide variety of customized  higher value flexible foam and coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers 
polyols  including polyether and polyester polyols  are used in conjunction with mdi and tdi in rigid foam  flexible foam and other non foam applications 
po is one of the principal raw materials for producing polyether polyols 
the following chart illustrates the range of product types and end uses for polyurethane chemicals 
graphic polyurethane chemicals are sold to customers who combine the chemicals to produce polyurethane products 
depending on their needs  customers will use either commodity polyurethane chemicals produced for mass sales or polyurethane systems tailored for their specific requirements 
by varying the blend  additives and specifications of the polyurethane chemicals  manufacturers are able to develop and produce a breadth and variety of polyurethane products 
mdi 
mdi has a substantially larger market size and a higher growth rate than tdi 
this is primarily because mdi can be used to make polyurethanes with a broader range of properties and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications than tdi 
we believe that future growth of mdi is expected to be driven by the continued substitution of mdi based polyurethane for fiberglass and other materials currently used in rigid insulation foam for construction 
we expect that other markets  such as binders for reconstituted wood board products  specialty cushioning applications and coatings will further contribute to the continued growth of mdi 
with the recent rapid growth of the developing asian economies  the asian markets have now become the largest market for mdi 
tpu 
tpu is a high quality  fully formulated thermal plastic derived from the reaction of mdi or an aliphatic isocyanate with polyols to produce unique qualities such as durability  flexibility  strength  abrasion resistance  shock absorbency and chemical resistance 
we can tailor the performance characteristics of tpu to meet the specific requirements of our customers 
tpu is used in injection molding and small components for the automotive and footwear industries 
it is also extruded into films  wires and cables for use in a wide variety of applications in the coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers markets 

table of contents polyols 
polyols are combined with mdi  tdi and other isocyanates to create a broad spectrum of polyurethane products 
demand for specialty polyols has been growing at approximately the same rate at which mdi consumption has grown 
aniline 
aniline is an intermediate chemical used primarily to manufacture mdi 
generally  aniline is either consumed internally by the producers of the aniline or is sold to third parties under long term supply contracts 
we believe that the lack of a significant spot market for aniline means that in order to remain competitive  mdi manufacturers must either be integrated with an aniline manufacturing facility or have a long term  cost competitive aniline supply contract 
po 
po is an intermediate chemical used mainly to produce a wide range of polyols and pg 
demand for po depends largely on overall economic demand  especially that of consumer durables 
the following chart illustrates the primary end markets and applications for po 
graphic mtbe 
mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
while mtbe has been effectively eliminated in the united states  demand continues to grow in other regions of the world 
in we announced the signing of a license agreement with chinese chemicals manufacturer yantai wanhua polyurethanes co  ltd  for the production of po and mtbe 
see environmental  health and safety matters mtbe developments below and part i

sales and marketing our global sales group markets our polyurethane chemicals to over  customers in more than countries 
our sales and technical resources are organized to support major regional markets  as well as key end use markets which require a more global approach 
these key end use markets include the appliance  automotive  footwear  furniture and coatings  construction products  adhesives  sealants and elastomers industries 

table of contents we provide a wide variety of polyurethane solutions as components ie  the isocyanate or the polyol or in the form of systems in which we provide the total isocyanate and polyol formulation to our customers in ready to use form 
our ability to deliver a range of polyurethane solutions and technical support tailored to meet our customer s needs is critical to our long term success 
we have strategically located our polyurethane formulation facilities  commonly referred to in the chemicals industry as systems houses  close to our customers  enabling us to focus on customer support and technical service 
we believe this customer support and technical service system contributes to customer retention and also provides opportunities for identifying further product and service needs of customers 
we manufacture polyols primarily to support our mdi customers requirements 
we believe that the extensive market knowledge and industry experience of our sales teams and technical experts  in combination with our strong emphasis on customer relationships  have facilitated our ability to establish and maintain long term customer supply positions 
our strategy is to continue to increase sales to existing customers and to attract new customers by providing innovative solutions  quality products  reliable supply  competitive prices and superior customer service 
manufacturing and operations our mdi production facilities are located in geismar  louisiana  rozenburg  the netherlands  and through our joint ventures in caojing  china 
these facilities receive aniline  which is a primary material used in the production of mdi  from our facilities located in geismar  louisiana  wilton  uk  and caojing  china 
we believe that this relative scale and product integration of our large facilities provide a significant competitive advantage over other producers 
in addition to reducing transportation costs for our raw materials  integration helps reduce our exposure to cyclical prices 
the following table sets forth the annual production capacity of polyurethane chemicals at each of our polyurethanes facilities mdi polyols tpu aniline nitrobenzene po pg mtbe millions of pounds millions of gallons geismar  louisiana osnabr ck  germany port neches  texas ringwood  illinois caojing  china rozenburg  the netherlands wilton  uk total represents our share of capacity from slic  an unconsolidated chinese joint venture 
represents our approximately share of capacity under our consolidated rubicon llc manufacturing joint venture with chemtura corporation 
at both our geismar and rozenburg facilities we utilize sophisticated proprietary technology to produce our mdi 
this technology  which is also used in our chinese joint venture  contributes to our position as a low cost mdi producer 
in addition to mdi  we use a proprietary manufacturing process to manufacture po 
we own or license all technology and know how developed and utilized at our po facility 
our process combines isobutane and oxygen in proprietary oxidation peroxidation reactors  thereby forming tbhp and tba  which are further processed into po and mtbe  respectively 
because our po production process is less expensive relative to other technologies and allows all of our 
table of contents po co products to be processed into saleable or useable materials  we believe that our po production technology possesses several distinct advantages over its alternatives 
we operate polyurethane systems houses in buenos aires  argentina  deer park  australia  shanghai  china  cartagena  colombia  deggendorf  germany  thane maharashtra  india  ternate  italy  tlalnepantla  mexico  mississauga  ontario  kuan yin  taiwan  samutprakarn  thailand  osnabr ck  germany  dammam  saudi arabia  tabo da serra  brazil and istanbul  turkey 
joint ventures rubicon joint venture 
chemtura corporation is our joint venture partner in rubicon llc  which owns aniline  nitrobenzene and dpa manufacturing facilities in geismar  louisiana 
we are entitled to approximately of the nitrobenzene and aniline production capacity of rubicon llc  and chemtura corporation is entitled to of the dpa production 
in addition to operating the joint venture s aniline  nitrobenzene and dpa facilities  rubicon llc also operates our wholly owned mdi  polyol and maleic anhydride facilities at geismar and is responsible for providing other auxiliary services to the entire geismar complex 
as a result of this joint venture  we are able to achieve greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would otherwise have been able to obtain 
rubicon llc is consolidated in our financial statements 
chinese mdi joint ventures 
we are involved in two related joint ventures which operate mdi production facilities near shanghai  china 
slic  our manufacturing joint venture with basf ag and three chinese chemical companies  produces mnb  aniline and crude mdi 
we effectively own of slic and account for our investment under the equity method 
hps  our splitting joint venture with shanghai chlor alkali chemical company  ltd  manufactures pure mdi  polymeric mdi and mdi variants 
we own of hps and it is a consolidated affiliate 
these projects have been funded by a combination of equity invested by the joint venture partners and borrowed funds 
the total production capacity of the slic facilities is million pounds per year of mdi and the splitting capacity of the hps facility is million pounds per year of mdi 
russian mdi  coatings and systems joint venture in  we purchased a interest in international polyurethane investments bv this company s wholly owned subsidiary  nmg is a leading polyurethanes producer headquartered in obninsk  russia 
we account for this investment under the equity method 
this joint venture  now huntsman nmg zao  manufactures and markets a range of polyurethane systems in adhesives  coatings  elastomers and insulation using our mdi products 
raw materials the primary raw materials for mdi based polyurethane chemicals are benzene and po 
benzene is a widely available commodity that is the primary feedstock for the production of mdi and aniline 
historically  benzene has been the largest component of our raw material costs 
we purchase benzene from third parties to manufacture nitrobenzene and aniline  almost all of which we then use to produce mdi 
a major cost in the production of polyols is attributable to the costs of po 
the integration of our po business with our polyurethane chemicals business gives us access to a competitively priced  strategic source of po and the opportunity to develop polyols that enhance our range of mdi products 
the primary raw materials used in our po production process are butane isobutane  propylene  methanol and oxygen  which accounted for   and  respectively  of segment raw material costs in we purchase a large portion of our raw materials under long term contracts 

table of contents competition our major competitors in the polyurethane chemicals market include basf  bayer  dow  yantai wanhua and lyondellbasell 
while these competitors and others produce various types and quantities of polyurethane chemicals  we focus on mdi and mdi based polyurethane systems 
our polyurethane chemicals business competes in two basic ways where price is the dominant element of competition  our polyurethane chemicals business differentiates itself by its high level of customer support  including cooperation on technical and safety matters  and elsewhere  we compete on the basis of product performance and our ability to react quickly to changing customer needs and by providing customers with innovative solutions to their needs 
some of our competitors in the polyurethanes segment are among the world s largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies 
these competitors may have their own raw material resources 
some of these companies may be able to produce products more economically than we can 
in addition  some of our competitors in this market have greater financial resources  which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses  including expenditures for research and development 
if any of our current or future competitors in this market develop proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost  our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete

as part of a business reorganization effective january   our performance specialties products will be organized around the following end markets energy  materials  additives  processing chemicals and agrochemicals 
amines 
amines broadly refers to the family of intermediate chemicals that are produced by reacting ammonia with various ethylene and propylene derivatives 
generally  amines are valued for their properties as a reactive  agent  emulsifier  dispersant  detergent  solvent or corrosion inhibiting agent 
growth in demand for amines is highly correlated with gdp growth due to its strong links to general industrial and consumer products markets 
however  certain segments of the amines market  such as polyetheramines  have grown at rates well in excess of gdp growth due to new product development  technical innovation  and substitution and replacement of competing products 
for example  polyetheramines are used by customers who demand increasingly sophisticated performance characteristics as an additive in the manufacture of highly customized epoxy formulations  enabling customers to penetrate new markets and substitute for traditional curing materials 
as amines are generally sold based upon the performance characteristics that they provide to customer specific end use application  pricing does not generally fluctuate directly with movements in underlying raw materials 
morpholine dga agent 
morpholine and dga agent are produced as co products by reacting ammonia with deg 
morpholine is used in a number of niche industrial applications including rubber curing as an accelerator and flocculants for water treatment 
dga agent is primarily used in gas treating  electronics  herbicides and metalworking end use applications 
carbonates 
ethylene and propylene carbonates are manufactured by reacting eo and po with carbon dioxide 
carbonates are used as solvents and as reactive diluents in polymer and coating 
table of contents applications 
they are also increasingly being used as a photo resist solvent in the manufacture of printed circuit boards  solar panels  lcd screens and the production of lithium batteries 
performance intermediates 
the following table sets forth the end markets for our performance intermediates products product group end markets surfactants alkoxylates household detergents  industrial cleaners  anti fog chemicals for glass  asphalt emulsions  shampoos  polymerization additives  de emulsifiers for petroleum production sulfonates sulfates powdered detergents  liquid detergents  shampoos  body washes  dishwashing liquids  industrial cleaners  emulsion polymerization  concrete superplasticizers  gypsum wallboard esters and derivatives shampoo  body wash  textile and leather treatment nitrogen derivatives bleach thickeners  baby shampoo  fabric conditioners  other personal care products formulated blends household detergents  textile and leather treatment  personal care products  pharmaceutical intermediates eo po block co polymers automatic dishwasher detergents ethanolamines wood preservatives  herbicides  construction products  gas treatment  metalworking lab consumer detergents  industrial and institutional detergents eg polyester fibers and pet bottle resins  antifreeze surfactants 
surfactants or surface active agents are substances that combine a water soluble component with a water insoluble component in the same molecule 
while surfactants are most commonly used for their detergency in cleaning applications  they are also valued for their emulsification  foaming  dispersing  penetrating and wetting properties in a variety of industries 
demand growth for surfactants is relatively stable and exhibits little cyclicality 
the main consumer product applications for surfactants can demand new formulations with improved performance characteristics  which affords considerable opportunity for innovative surfactants manufacturers like us to provide surfactants and blends with differentiated specifications and properties 
for basic surfactants  pricing tends to have a strong relationship to underlying raw material prices and usually lags raw material price movements 
ethanolamines 
ethanolamines are a range of chemicals produced by the reaction of eo with ammonia 
they are used as intermediates in the production of a variety of industrial  agricultural and consumer products 
there are a limited number of competitors due to the technical and cost barriers to entry 
growth in this sector has typically been higher than gdp but saw a decline in late followed by a recovery in demand in lab 
lab is a surfactant intermediate which is produced through the reaction of benzene with either normal paraffins or linear alpha olefins 
nearly all the lab produced globally is converted into las  a major anionic surfactant used worldwide for the production of consumer  industrial and institutional laundry detergents 

table of contents three major manufacturers lead the traditional detergency market for lab in north america procter gamble  henkel and the sun products corp 
we believe that two thirds of the lab global capacity lies in the hands of ten producers  with three or four major producers in each of the three regional markets 
although the north american market for lab is mature  we expect latin american and other developing countries to grow as detergent demand grows at a faster rate than gdp 
growth in demand for specialty alkylates for use in lubricants is expected to be higher than gdp 
we have developed a unique manufacturing capability for a high molecular weight alkylate for this market 
with a significant technical barrier to entry  our specialty alkylate capability has allowed us greater diversity in our portfolio and strengthened our competitive position versus lab only producers 
eg 
we consume our internally produced eo to produce three types of eg meg  deg and teg 
meg is consumed primarily in the polyester fiber and bottle resin and antifreeze end markets and is also used in a wide variety of industrial applications including synthetic lubricants  plasticizers  solvents and emulsifiers 
deg is consumed internally for the production of morpholine dga agent and polyols 
teg is used internally for the production of polyols and is sold into the market for dehydration of natural gas 
we continue to optimize our eo and eg operations depending on the fundamental market demand for eg 
maleic anhydride and licensing 
the following table sets forth the end markets for our maleic anhydride products product group end markets maleic anhydride boat hulls  automotive  construction  lubricant and fuel additives  countertops  agrochemicals  paper  and food additives maleic anhydride catalyst and technology licensing maleic anhydride  bdo and its derivatives  and pbt manufacturers maleic anhydride is a chemical intermediate that is produced by oxidizing either benzene or normal butane through the use of a catalyst 
the largest use of maleic anhydride in the us is in the production of uprs  which we believe account for approximately of north american maleic anhydride demand 
upr is the main ingredient in fiberglass reinforced resins  which are used for marine and automotive applications and commercial and residential construction products 
our maleic anhydride technology is a proprietary fixed bed process with solvent recovery and is characterized by low butane consumption and an energy efficient  high percentage recovery solvent recovery system 
this process competes against two other processes  the fluid bed process and the fixed bed process with water recovery 
we believe that our process is superior in the areas of feedstock and energy efficiency and solvent recovery 
the maleic anhydride based route to bdo manufacture is currently the preferred process technology and is favored over the other routes  which include po  butadiene and acetylene as feedstocks 
as a result  the growth in demand for bdo has resulted in increased demand for our maleic anhydride technology and catalyst 
total north american demand for maleic anhydride in was approximately million pounds 
over time  demand for maleic anhydride has generally grown at rates that slightly exceed gdp growth 
however  given its dependence on the upr market  which is heavily influenced by construction end markets  demand for this application can be cyclical 
generally  changes in price have resulted from changes in industry capacity utilization as opposed to changes in underlying raw material costs 
sales and marketing we sell over  products to over  customers globally through our performance products marketing groups  which have extensive market knowledge  considerable chemical industry experience and well established customer relationships 

table of contents our performance specialties markets are organized around end use market applications  such as coatings  polymers and resins and agrochemical 
in these end uses  our marketing efforts are focused on how our product offerings perform in certain customer applications 
we believe that this approach enhances the value of our product offerings and creates opportunities for ongoing differentiation in our development activities with our customers 
our performance intermediates and maleic anhydride groups organize their marketing efforts around their products and geographic regions served 
we also provide extensive pre and post sales technical service support to our customers where our technical service professionals work closely with our research and development functions to tailor our product offerings to meet our customers unique and changing requirements 
finally  these technical service professionals interact closely with our market managers and business leadership teams to help guide future offerings and market approach strategies 
in addition to our focused direct sales efforts  we maintain an extensive global network of distributors and agents that also sell our products 
these distributors and agents typically promote our products to smaller end use customers who cannot be served cost effectively by our direct sales forces

table of contents competition we are the leading global solutions provider for textile chemicals and dyes in our chosen markets 
competition within the textile chemicals and dyes markets is generally fragmented with few competitors who offer complete solutions for both markets 
our major competitors are clariant  basf  kiri dystar and longsheng 
we believe that our competitive strengths include our product offering  which is characterized by its broad range  high quality  significant integration between products and service  reliable technical expertise  long standing relationships with customers  and strong business infrastructure in asia 
we believe that we have more customer service capability and account management capability than any of our competitors worldwide 
pigments general we are a global leader in the creation of titanium dioxide solutions 
titanium dioxide is a white inert pigment which provides whiteness  opacity and brightness to thousands of everyday items including paints  plastics  paper  inks  food and personal care products 
expertise gained over years combined with a pioneering spirit enable us to help our customers to succeed 
we use our expertise in titanium dioxide to create solutions for our customers that can deliver much more than whiteness and opacity including freeing capacity  reducing energy use and enabling infrastructure to last longer 
our tioxide and deltio brands are made in our seven manufacturing facilities around the globe and service over  customers in practically all industries and geographic regions 
our global manufacturing footprint allows us to service both the needs of local and global customers  including ampacet  a 
schulman  akzo nobel  basf  cabot  clariant  jotun  polyone and ppg 
our pigments segment is focused on working with customers to create innovative solutions that will help them succeed and improving our competitive position 
for example  our award winning range of free flow deltio pigments  helps our customers improve their working environments and reduce energy consumption 
in addition  we are focused on manufacturing efficiencies 
in we approved the investment of approximately million at our calais site to build a new magnesium sulfate fertilizer manufacturing operation that will increase the efficiency  sustainability and cost effectiveness of the site 
this will be operation in and we continue to pursue other projects to improve manufacturing costs at each of our facilities 
products and markets historically  global titanium dioxide demand growth rates tend to closely track global gdp growth rates 
however  this varies by region 
developed markets such as the us and western europe exhibit higher absolute consumption but lower demand growth rates  while emerging markets such as asia exhibit much higher demand growth rates 
the titanium dioxide industry experiences some seasonality in its sales reflecting the high exposure to seasonal coatings end use markets 
coating sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere  resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year 
there are two manufacturing processes for the production of titanium dioxide  the sulfate process and the chloride process 
we currently believe that the chloride process accounts for approximately of global production capacity 
most end use applications can use pigments produced by either process  although there are markets that need pigment from a specific manufacturing route ie the inks market for sulfate and the automotive coatings market for chloride 
regional markets typically favor products that are available locally 

table of contents aside from the five major producers which include huntsman  the titanium dioxide industry currently has a large number of small regional or local producers  especially in china 
titanium dioxide supply has historically kept pace with increases in demand as producers increased capacity through low cost incremental debottlenecks  efficiency improvements and  more recently  new capacity additions in china 
during periods of low titanium dioxide demand  the industry experiences high stock levels and consequently reduces production to manage working capital 
pricing in the industry is driven primarily by supply demand balance 
based upon current price levels and the long lead times for planning  governmental approvals and construction  we expect supply additions for the near term in line with historical demand growth 
sales and marketing approximately of our titanium dioxide sales are made through our global sales and technical services network  enabling us to work closely with our customers 
our focused sales effort and local manufacturing presence have allowed us to achieve leading market shares in a number of the countries where we manufacture titanium dioxide 
in addition  we have focused on marketing products and services to higher growth and higher value applications 
for example  we believe that our pigments business is well positioned to benefit from growth sectors where customers needs are complex resulting in less companies having the capability to support them 
we focus a lot of research and development in the creation of solutions that can help to address the megatrends that we see emerging as evidenced by our deltio pigments range which helps our customers to liberate capacity  reduce energy  improve working environments and reduce waste 
manufacturing and operations our pigments business has seven manufacturing sites operating in seven countries with a total capacity of approximately  tonnes per year 
approximately of our titanium dioxide capacity is located in western europe 
annual capacity metric tons site eame north america apac process greatham  uk  chloride calais  france  sulfate huelva  spain  sulfate scarlino  italy  sulfate umbogintwini  south africa  sulfate lake charles  louisiana  chloride teluk kalung  malaysia  sulfate total this facility is owned and operated by louisiana pigment company  lp  a manufacturing joint venture that is owned by us and by kronos worldwide 
the capacity shown reflects our interest in louisiana pigment company  lp in we announced an investment of approximately million approximately million to build a new magnesium sulfate fertilizer manufacturing operation at our plant in calais  france 
the new facility will enable the closure of part of our calais effluent treatment plant  which is expected to increase the efficiency  sustainability and cost effectiveness of the entire calais site 

table of contents joint venture louisiana pigment company  lp is our joint venture with kronos worldwide 
we share production offtake and operating costs of the plant equally with kronos worldwide  though we market our share of the production independently 
the operations of the joint venture are under the direction of a supervisory committee on which each partner has equal representation 
our investment in louisiana pigment company  lp is accounted for using the equity method 
raw materials the primary raw materials used to produce titanium dioxide are titanium bearing ores 
historically we have purchased the majority of our ore under long term supply contracts with a number of ore suppliers 
the majority of titanium bearing ores are sourced from australia  africa and canada 
ore accounts for approximately of pigment variable manufacturing costs  while utilities electricity  gas and steam  sulfuric acid and chlorine collectively account for approximately of our variable manufacturing costs 
the world market for titanium bearing ores has a small number of large suppliers rio tinto  iluka and exxaro which account for approximately of global supply and from which we purchase approximately of our needs 
however  the choice of producers has increased in recent years with a number of emerging suppliers and we have broadened our supply base by purchasing increasing amounts of our ores from these suppliers 
the titanium bearing ores market is in the process of moving from long term supply contracts with pricing formulas to short term contracts with market based prices 
as a result of this shift we expect to see a significant increase in our ore costs as our existing contracts expire 
during  approximately of our ore will be purchased under existing long term contracts and the remainder under new shorter term contracts 
titanium dioxide producers extract titanium from ores and process it into pigmentary titanium dioxide using either the chloride or sulfate process 
once an intermediate titanium dioxide pigment has been produced  it is finished into a product with specific performance characteristics for particular end use applications 
the finishing process is common to both the sulfate and chloride processes and is a major determinant of the final product s performance characteristics 
co products from both processes require treatment prior to disposal in order to comply with environmental regulations 
in order to reduce our disposal costs and to increase our cost competitiveness  we have developed and marketed the co products of our pigments business 
we sell over of the co products generated by our business 
competition the global markets in which our pigments business operates are highly competitive 
competition is based on the basis of price  product quality and service 
the major global producers against whom we compete are dupont  tronox  kronos and cristal  each of which has a global presence and the ability to service all global markets 
some of our competitors may be able to produce products more economically than we can 
in addition  some of our competitors in this market have greater financial resources  which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses  including expenditures for research and development 
if any of our current or future competitors in this market develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost  our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete 
moreover  the sulphate based titanium dioxide technology used by our pigments business is widely available 
accordingly  barriers to entry  apart from capital availability  may be low and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing

in addition to our own patents and patent applications and proprietary trade secrets and know how  we are a party to certain licensing arrangements and other agreements authorizing us to use trade secrets  know how and related technology and or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities 
we also have licensed or sub licensed intellectual property rights to third parties 
we have associated brand names with a number of our products  and we have approximately us trademark registrations including applications for registration currently pending at the us patent and trademark office  and approximately  foreign counterparts  including both registrations and applications for registration 
some of these registrations and applications include filings under the madrid system for the international registration of marks and may confer rights in multiple countries 
however  there can be no assurance that the trademark registrations will provide meaningful protection against the use of similar trademarks by competitors  or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted 
because of the breadth and nature of our intellectual property rights and our business  we do not believe that any single intellectual property right other than certain trademarks for which we intend to maintain the applicable registrations is material to our business

employees as of december   we employed approximately  people in our operations around the world 
approximately  of these employees are located in the us  while approximately  are located in other countries 
we believe our relations with our employees are good 
environmental  health and safety matters general we are subject to extensive federal  state  local and international laws  regulations  rules and ordinances relating to safety  pollution  protection of the environment  product management and distribution  and the generation  storage  handling  transportation  treatment  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials 
in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities 
in addition  our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal  modification and  in certain circumstances  revocation 
actual or alleged violations of safety laws  environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations or product distribution  substantial civil or criminal sanctions  as well as  under some environmental laws  the assessment of strict liability and or joint and several liability 
moreover  changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations  or require us to modify our facilities or operations 
accordingly  environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses  costs or liabilities 
environmental  health and safety systems we are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable environmental  health and safety ehs legal requirements  and we have developed policies and management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of ehs legal requirements applicable to our operations  enhance compliance with applicable legal requirements  ensure the safety of our employees  contractors  community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants 
although ehs legal requirements are constantly changing and are frequently difficult to comply with  these ehs management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and minimizing overall risk to us 
ehs capital expenditures we may incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under ehs laws  including costs to acquire  maintain and repair pollution control equipment 
for the years ended december   and  our capital expenditures for ehs matters totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
because capital expenditures for these matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend  in part  on the timing  promulgation and enforcement of specific requirements  our capital expenditures for ehs matters have varied significantly from year to year and we cannot provide assurance that our recent expenditures will be indicative of future amounts required under ehs laws 
remediation liabilities we have incurred  and we may in the future incur  liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials 
similarly  we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that 
table of contents was disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses 
under some circumstances  the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources 
under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and similar state laws  a current or former owner or operator of real property may be liable for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal of hazardous substances was in compliance with law at the time it occurred  and a current owner or operator may be liable regardless of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the release 
outside the us  analogous contaminated property laws  such as those in effect in france and australia  can hold past owners and or operators liable for remediation at former facilities 
we have been notified by third parties of claims against us for cleanup liabilities at approximately former facilities or third party sites  including  but not limited to  sites listed under cercla 
based on current information and past experiences at other cercla sites  we do not expect any of these third party claims to result in material liability to us 
one of these sites  the north maybe canyon mine cercla site  includes an abandoned phosphorous mine near soda springs  idaho believed to have been operated by one of our predecessor companies el paso products company 
in  the us forest service notified us that we are a cercla potentially responsible party a prp for the mine site involving selenium contaminated surface water 
under a administrative order  the current mine lessee  nu west industries  inc  began undertaking the investigation required for a cercla removal process 
in  the site was transitioned to the cercla remedial action process  which requires a remedial investigation feasibility study an ri fs 
in  the forest service notified the three prps our company  nu west and wells cargo that it would undertake the ri fs itself 
on february   in conjunction with wells cargo  we agreed to jointly comply with a unilateral administrative order a uao to conduct an ri fs of the entire west ridge of the site  although we are alleged to have had only a limited historical presence in the investigation area 
in march  following the initiation of litigation by nu west  the forest service assumed nu west s original investigation obligations 
on june   we received the uao which had been executed by the forest service and we are presently carrying out the requirements of the order 
we continue to coordinate with our insurers regarding policy coverage in this matter 
at this time  we do not believe the costs to remediate this site will be material to our financial statements 
in addition  under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state laws  we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties as a condition to our hazardous waste permit 
some of our manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use  including on site waste disposal 
we are aware of soil  groundwater or surface contamination from past operations at some of our sites  and we may find contamination at other sites in the future 
for example  our port neches  texas  and geismar  louisiana  facilities are the subject of ongoing remediation requirements under rcra authority 
similar laws exist in a number of locations in which we currently operate  or previously operated  manufacturing facilities  such as australia  switzerland and italy 
in june of  an agreement was reached between the local regulatory authorities and our advanced materials site in pamplona  spain to relocate our manufacturing operations in order to facilitate new urban development desired by the city 
subsequently  as required by the authorities  soil and groundwater sampling was performed and followed by a quantitative risk assessment 
in october  the local authorities approved our proposed two phase remedial approach 
the first phase was installed in and involves groundwater extraction and treatment in one limited area of the site 
the second phase  not yet defined  would proceed during site redevelopment 
as the second phase remediation has not yet been defined  we are unable to assess our potential liability 

table of contents by letter dated march   our base chemicals and polymers facility in west footscray  australia  was issued a clean up notice by the environment protection authority  victoria  australia the epa victoria due to concerns about soil and groundwater contamination emanating from the site 
the agency revoked the original clean up notice on september  and issued a revised clean up notice due to the complexity of contamination issues at the site 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a million liability related to estimated environmental remediation costs at this site 
on august   epa victoria revoked the second clean up notice and issued a revised notice that included a requirement for financial assurance for the remediation 
we have reached agreement with the agency that a mortgage on the land will be held by the agency as financial surety during the period covered by the current clean up notice  which ends on july  we can provide no assurance that the agency will not seek to institute additional requirements for the site or that additional costs will not be associated with the clean up 
this facility has been closed and demolished 
by letter dated march   the us department of justice the doj notified us that the us environmental protection agency the epa has requested that the doj bring an action in federal court against us and other prps for recovery of costs incurred by the us in connection with releases of hazardous substances from the state marine superfund site in port arthur  texas 
as of august   the epa had incurred and paid approximately million in unreimbursed response costs related to the site 
prior to filing the complaint  the doj requested that prps sign and return a standard tolling agreement from march  through september  and participate in settlement discussions 
we originally responded to an information request regarding this site on march  and identified historical transactions associated with a predecessor of a company we acquired 
the prior owners have contractually agreed to indemnify us in this matter 
while the doj is aware of the indemnity  we may be required to participate in future settlement discussions  therefore  on march   we submitted the signed tolling agreement and offer to negotiate to the doj 
the tolling agreement has since been extended three times  most recently through january  in a direct final rule published december   epa region announced that it is delisting this superfund site from the national priorities list 
in many cases  our potential liability arising from historical contamination is based on operations and other events occurring prior to our ownership of a business or specific facility 
in these situations  we frequently obtained an indemnity agreement from the prior owner addressing remediation liabilities arising from pre closing conditions 
we have successfully exercised our rights under these contractual covenants for a number of sites and  where applicable  mitigated our ultimate remediation liability 
we cannot assure you  however  that the liabilities for all such matters subject to indemnity  will be honored by the prior owner or that our existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for such matters 
based on available information and the indemnification rights we believe are likely to be available  we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
however  if such indemnities are not honored or do not fully cover the costs of investigation and remediation or we are required to contribute to such costs  then such expenditures may have a material effect on our financial statements 
at the current time  we are unable to estimate the total cost  exclusive of indemnification benefits  to remediate any of the known contamination sites 
environmental reserves we have accrued liabilities relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations  site reclamation and closure costs and known penalties 
liabilities are recorded when potential liabilities are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
our liability estimates are calculated using present value techniques as appropriate and are based upon requirements placed upon us by regulators  available facts  existing technology and past experience 
the environmental liabilities 
table of contents do not include amounts recorded as asset retirement obligations 
we had accrued million and million for environmental liabilities as of december  and  respectively 
of these amounts  million and million were classified as accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively  and million and million were classified as other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
in certain cases  our remediation liabilities may be payable over periods of up to years 
we may incur losses for environmental remediation in excess of the amounts accrued  however  we are not able to estimate the amount or range of such potential excess 
regulatory developments on june   the european union s eu regulatory framework for chemicals called registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach took effect  designed to be phased in over years 
as a reach regulated company that manufactures in or imports more than one metric ton per year of a chemical substance into the european economic area eea  we were required to pre register with the european chemicals agency  echa  such chemical substances and isolated intermediates to take advantage of the year phase in period 
to meet our compliance obligations  a cross business reach team was established  through which we were able to fulfill all required pre registrations and our first phase registrations by the november  deadline 
while we continue our registration efforts to meet the next registration deadline of june  our reach implementation team is now strategically focused on the authorization phase of the reach process  directing its efforts to address substances of very high concern and evaluating potential business implications 
where warranted  evaluation of substitute chemicals will be an important element of our ongoing manufacturing sustainability efforts 
as a chemical manufacturer with global operations  we are also actively monitoring and addressing analogous regulatory regimes being considered or implemented outside of the eu 
although the total long term cost for reach compliance is unknown at this time  we spent approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  to meet the initial reach requirements 
we cannot provide assurance that these recent expenditures are indicative of future amounts that we may be required to spend for reach compliance 
greenhouse gas regulation although the existence of binding emissions limitations under international treaties such as the kyoto protocol is in doubt after  we expect some or all of our operations to be subject to regulatory requirements to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ghg 
even in the absence of a new global agreement to limit ghgs  we may be subject to additional regulation under the european union emissions trading system as well as new national and regional ghg trading programs 
for example  our operations in australia and selected us states may be subject to future ghg regulations under emissions trading systems in those jurisdictions 
because the united states has not adopted federal climate change legislation  domestic ghg efforts are likely to be guided by epa regulations in the near future 
while epa s ghg programs are currently subject to judicial challenge  our domestic operations may become subject to epa s regulatory requirements when implemented 
in particular  expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the clean air act s prevention of significant deterioration requirements under epa s ghg tailoring rule 
in addition  certain aspects of our operations may be subject to ghg emissions monitoring and reporting requirements 
if we are subject to epa ghg regulations  we may face increased monitoring  reporting  and compliance costs 
we are already managing and reporting ghg emissions  to varying degrees  as required by law for our sites in locations subject to kyoto protocol obligations and or eu emissions trading scheme 
table of contents requirements 
although these sites are subject to existing ghg legislation  few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs  although it is possible that ghg emission restrictions may increase over time 
potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet ghg emission restrictions and or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation  as well as direct compliance costs 
currently  however  it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghg in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  droughts  and floods and other climatic events 
if any of those effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 
mtbe developments we produce mtbe  an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
litigation or legislative initiatives restricting the use of mtbe in gasoline may subject us or our products to environmental liability or materially adversely affect our sales and costs 
because mtbe has contaminated some water supplies  its use has become controversial in the us and elsewhere  and its use has been effectively eliminated in the us market 
we currently market mtbe  either directly or through third parties  to gasoline additive customers located outside the us  although there are additional costs associated with such outside us sales which may result in decreased profitability compared to historical sales in the us we may also elect to use all or a portion of our precursor tba to produce saleable products other than mtbe 
if we opt to produce products other than mtbe  necessary modifications to our facilities will require significant capital expenditures and the sale of such other products may produce a lower level of cash flow than that historically produced from the sale of mtbe 
numerous companies  including refiners  manufacturers and sellers of gasoline  as well as manufacturers of mtbe  have been named as defendants in numerous cases in us courts that allege mtbe contamination in groundwater 
the plaintiffs in the mtbe groundwater contamination cases generally seek compensatory damages  punitive damages  injunctive relief  such as monitoring and abatement  and attorney fees 
between and  we were named as a defendant in of these lawsuits in new york state and federal courts  which we settled in an amount immaterial to us 
it is possible that we could be named as a defendant in existing or future mtbe contamination cases 
we cannot provide assurances that adverse results against us in existing or future mtbe contamination cases will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
india investigation during the third quarter of  we completed an internal investigation of the operations of petro araldite pvt 
ltd 
papl  our majority owned joint venture in india 
papl manufactures base liquid resins  base solid resins and formulated products in india 
the investigation initially focused on allegations of illegal disposal of hazardous waste and waste water discharge and related reporting irregularities 
based upon preliminary findings  the investigation was expanded to include a review of the production and off book sales of certain products and waste products 
the investigation included the legality under indian law and us law  including the us foreign corrupt practices act  of certain payments made by employees of the joint venture to government officials in india 
records at the facility covering nine months in and early show that less than  in payments were made to officials for that period  in addition  payments in unknown amounts may have been made by individuals from the facility in previous years 
in may and july  papl fully disclosed the environmental noncompliance issues to the local indian environmental agency  the tamil nadu pollution control board tnpcb 
all environmental compliance and reporting issues have been addressed to the agency s satisfaction other than the use of 
table of contents freshwater for the dilution of wastewater effluent discharges and including the remediation of several off site solid waste disposal areas 
both remaining issues are being addressed 
at tnpcb s direction  we submitted a plan for the remediation of the off site waste disposal areas  which the tnpcb approved 
the impacted off site soil was excavated and relocated to the site 
final commercial disposal methods for the removed waste await approval from tnpcb  although we do not anticipate the costs to be material 
also in may  we voluntarily contacted the us securities and exchange commission the sec and the doj to advise them of our investigation and that we intend to cooperate fully with each of them 
we met with the sec and the doj in october to discuss this matter and we continue to cooperate with these agencies 
steps have been taken to halt all known illegal or improper activity  including the termination of employment of management employees as appropriate 
no conclusions can be drawn at this time as to whether any government agencies will open formal investigations of these matters or what remedies such agencies may seek 
governmental agencies could assess material civil and criminal penalties and fines against papl and potentially against us and could issue orders that adversely affect the operations of papl 
we cannot  however  determine at this time the magnitude of the penalties and fines that could be assessed  the total costs to remediate the prior noncompliance or the effects of implementing any necessary corrective measures on papl s operations

risk factors any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
risks related to our business our industry is affected by global economic factors including risks associated with volatile economic conditions 
our financial results are substantially dependent on overall economic conditions in the us  europe and asia 
declining economic conditions in all or any of these locations or negative perceptions about economic conditions could result in a substantial decrease in demand for our products and could adversely affect our business 
in particular  our operations in europe continue to be impacted by the uncertain european economy 
while we currently anticipate that  in the aggregate  our business in europe will grow slowly  a currency or financial crisis in europe could precipitate a significant decline in the european economy  which would likely result in a decrease in demand for our products in europe 
uncertain economic conditions and market instability make it particularly difficult for us to forecast demand trends 
the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain  and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time 
as a consequence  we may not be able to accurately predict future economic conditions or the effect of such conditions on our financial condition or results of operations 
we can give no assurances as to the timing  extent or duration of the current or future economic cycles impacting the chemical industry 
significant price volatility or interruptions in supply of our raw materials may result in increased costs that we may be unable to pass on to our customers  which could reduce our profitability 
the prices of the raw materials that we purchase from third parties are cyclical and volatile 
we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials from third party suppliers 
the cost of these raw materials represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses 
the prices for a number of these raw materials generally follow price trends of  and vary with market conditions for  crude oil and natural gas feedstocks  which are highly volatile and cyclical 
in general  the feedstocks and other raw materials we consume are organic commodity products that are readily available at market prices 
however  ore feedstocks for our pigments segment are periodically in short supply 
we frequently enter into supply agreements with particular suppliers  but disruptions of existing supply arrangements or expiration of favorable supply contracts could substantially impact our profitability 
if certain of our suppliers are unable to meet their obligations under present supply agreements  we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials from other sources and we may not be able to increase prices for our finished products to recoup the higher raw materials costs 
in addition  if raw materials become unavailable within a geographic area from which they are now sourced  we may not be able to obtain suitable or cost effective substitutes 
any interruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our costs or decrease our revenues  which could reduce our cash flow 
our supply agreements typically provide for market based pricing and provide us only limited protection against price volatility 
while we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding product price increases  we are not always able to raise product prices immediately or at all 
timing differences between raw material prices  which may change daily  and contract product prices  which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often  have had and may continue to have a negative effect on our cash flow 
any cost increase that we are not able to pass on to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents the markets for many of our products are cyclical and volatile  and we may experience depressed market conditions for such products 
historically  the markets for many of our products have experienced alternating periods of tight supply  causing prices and profit margins to increase  followed by periods of capacity additions  resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins 
the volatility these markets experience occurs as a result of changes in the supply and demand for products  changes in energy prices and changes in various other economic conditions around the world 
this cyclicality and volatility of our industry results in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over the business cycle 
our results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  legal restrictions and taxes 
we conduct a majority of our business operations outside the us  and these operations are subject to risks normally associated with international operations 
these risks include the need to convert currencies that may be received for our products into currencies in which we purchase raw materials or pay for services  which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates 
in addition  we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period 
during times of a strengthening us dollar  our reported international sales and earnings may be reduced because the local currency may translate into fewer us dollars 
because we currently have significant operations located outside the us  we are exposed to fluctuations in global currency rates which may result in gains or losses on our financial statements 
other risks of international operations include trade barriers  tariffs  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  social and political risks  general economic risks and required compliance with a variety of us and foreign laws  including tax laws and the foreign corrupt practices act 
in addition  although we maintain an anti corruption compliance program throughout our company  violations of our compliance program may result in criminal or civil sanctions  including material monetary fines  penalties and other costs against us or our employees  and may have a material adverse effect on our business 
furthermore  in foreign jurisdictions where process of law may vary from country to country  we may experience difficulty in enforcing agreements 
in jurisdictions where bankruptcy laws and practices may vary  we may experience difficulty collecting foreign receivables through foreign legal systems 
the occurrence of these risks  among others  could disrupt the businesses of our international subsidiaries  which could significantly affect their ability to make distributions to us 
we operate in a significant number of jurisdictions  which contributes to the volatility of our effective tax rate 
changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our effective tax rate 
in addition  generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap or us gaap has required us to place valuation allowances against our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in a number of tax jurisdictions 
these valuation allowances primarily result from analysis of positive and negative evidence supporting the realization of tax benefits 
negative evidence includes a cumulative history of pre tax operating losses in those specific tax jurisdictions 
changes in valuation allowances have resulted in material fluctuations in our effective tax rate 
economic conditions may dictate the continued imposition of the current valuation allowances and potentially the establishment of new valuation allowances 
while significant valuation allowances remain  our effective tax rate will likely continue to experience significant fluctuations 

table of contents our efforts to grow our businesses may require significant investments  if our growth strategies are unsuccessful  our business  results of operations and or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
we continuously evaluate growth opportunities 
our growth initiatives may involve making acquisitions  entering into partnerships and joint ventures  and building new facilities any of which could require a significant investment 
we have incurred indebtedness to finance growth initiatives  and we may incur additional indebtedness to finance future growth initiatives 
we could also issue additional shares of stock to finance such initiatives 
if our growth strategies are not successful  we could face increased financial pressure  such as increased cash flow demands  reduced liquidity and diminished access to financial markets 
in addition  the implementation of growth strategies may create additional risks  including diversion of management focus away from existing operations  impairment of the operation of our business due to capital or equity commitments  inability to accurately predict the costs and benefits of acquisitions  partnerships  joint ventures or new facilities  inability to efficiently operate new businesses or to integrate acquired businesses  disruptions to important business relationships  increased operating costs  difficulties in realizing projected synergies  exposure to unanticipated liabilities  including for illegal activities conducted by an acquired company or a joint venture partner  and usage of limited investment and other baskets under our debt covenants 
all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
financial difficulties and related problems at our customers  vendors  suppliers and other business partners could have a material adverse effect on our business 
during periods of economic disruption  more of our customers than normal may experience financial difficulties  including bankruptcies  restructurings and liquidations  which could affect our business by reducing sales  increasing our risk in extending trade credit to customers and reducing our profitability 
a significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer  require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer s receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer 
in addition  we rely on a number of vendors and suppliers and collaborations with other industry participants to provide us with chemicals  feedstocks and other raw materials  along with energy sources and  in certain cases  facilities  that we need to operate our business 
during periods of economic disruption  some of these companies could be forced to reduce their output  shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection 
if this were to occur  it could adversely affect their ability to provide us with the raw materials  energy sources or facilities that we need  which could materially disrupt our operations  including the production of certain of our products 
moreover  it could be difficult to find replacements for certain of our business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases 
all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents the industries in which we compete are highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors that have greater financial resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 
among our competitors are some of the world s largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources 
changes in the competitive landscape could make it difficult for us to retain our leadership position in various products and markets throughout the world 
in addition  some of the companies with whom we compete may be able to produce products more economically than we can 
furthermore  some of our competitors have greater financial resources  which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses  including expenditures for research and development 
some of our competitors are owned or partially owned by foreign governments which may provide a competitive advantage to those competitors 
while we are engaged in a range of research and development programs to develop new products and processes  to improve and refine existing products and processes  and to develop new applications for existing products  the failure to develop new products  processes or applications could make us less competitive 
moreover  if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost  our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete 
in addition  certain of our businesses use technology that is widely available 
accordingly  barriers to entry  apart from capital availability  may be low in certain product segments of our business  and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing 
further  petroleum rich countries have become more significant participants in the petrochemical industry and may expand this role significantly in the future 
increased competition in any of our businesses could compel us to reduce the prices of our products  which could result in reduced profit margins and loss of market share and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our significant debt level makes us vulnerable to downturns and may limit our ability to respond to market conditions or to obtain additional financing 
we have significant outstanding debt as of december   our total consolidated outstanding debt was approximately  million including current portion of debt  our debt to total capitalization ratio was approximately  our combined outstanding variable rate borrowings were approximately billion  and our current portion of debt totaled approximately million 
our debt level  and the fact that a significant percentage of our cash flow is required to make payments on our debt  could have important consequences for our business  including but not limited to the following we may be more vulnerable to business  industry or economic downturns  making it more difficult to respond to market conditions  cash flow available for other purposes  including the growth of our business  may be reduced  our ability to obtain additional financing may be constrained  particularly during periods when the capital markets are unsettled  our competitors with lower debt levels may have a competitive advantage relative to us  and part of our debt is subject to variable interest rates  which makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates for example  a increase in interest rates  without giving effect to interest rate hedges or other offsetting items  would increase our annual interest rate expense by approximately million 

table of contents our debt level also impacts our credit ratings 
any decision by credit rating agencies to downgrade our debt ratings could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing and could result in increased interest and other costs 
agreements governing our debt may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or to obtain additional financing 
the agreements governing our debt arrangements contain certain restrictive covenants 
these covenants may limit or prohibit our ability to incur more debt  make certain prepayments of debt  pay dividends  redeem stock or make other distributions  issue stock  make investments  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  merge or consolidate  and transfer or sell assets 
our failure to comply with any of our debt covenants  or our failure to make payments of principal or interest on our debt  could result in a default  or trigger cross default or acceleration provisions  under our debt agreements 
an event of default could result in our debt obligations becoming immediately due and payable  cause our creditors to terminate their lending commitments  or force us or one or more of our subsidiaries into bankruptcy or liquidation 
any of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
for more information regarding our debt covenants  see part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources compliance with covenants 
natural or other disasters could disrupt our business and result in loss of revenue or in higher expenses 
any serious disruption at any of our facilities due to hurricane  fire  earthquake  flood or any other natural or man made disaster could impair our ability to use our facilities and have a material impact on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses 
if there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at any of these facilities  it could impair our ability to adequately supply our customers and negatively impact our operating results 
in addition  many of our current and potential customers are concentrated in specific geographic areas 
a disaster in one of these regions could have a material impact on our operations  operating results and financial condition 
while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that could disrupt our business  we cannot provide assurances that our plans would fully protect us from all such disasters or events that might result due to climate change 
in addition  insurance may not adequately compensate us from any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters 
furthermore  in areas prone to frequent natural or other disasters  insurance may become increasingly expensive or not available at all 
our operations involve risks that may increase our operating costs  which could reduce our profitability 
although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions  our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing and marketing of chemical products 
these hazards include chemical spills  pipeline leaks and ruptures  storage tank leaks  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other hazards incident to the manufacturing  processing  handling  transportation and storage of dangerous chemicals 
we are also potentially subject to other hazards  including natural disasters and severe weather  explosions and fires  transportation problems  including interruptions  spills and leaks  mechanical failures  unscheduled downtimes  labor difficulties  remediation complications  and other risks 
many potential hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage  and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities 
furthermore  we are subject to present and future claims with respect 
table of contents to workplace exposure  exposure of contractors on our premises as well as other persons located nearby  workers compensation and other matters 
we maintain property  business interruption  products liability and casualty insurance policies which we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices  as well as insurance policies covering other types of risks  such as pollution legal liability insurance  but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business 
each of these insurance policies is subject to customary exclusions  deductibles and coverage limits  in accordance with industry standards and practices 
as a result of market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and  in some instances  certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  we are subject to various claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business 
we are a party to various pending lawsuits and proceedings 
it is possible that judgments could be rendered against us in these cases or others in which we could be uninsured or not covered by indemnity and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters 
our operations  financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected by legal claims against us  including antitrust claims 
we face risks arising from various legal actions  including matters relating to antitrust  product liability  intellectual property and environmental claims 
over the past few years  antitrust claims have been made against chemical companies  and we have been named as a defendant in the antitrust suits discussed in item legal proceedings antitrust matters below 
in this type of litigation  the plaintiffs generally seek treble damages  which may be significant 
an adverse outcome in any antitrust claim could be material and significantly impact our operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to many ehs regulations that may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities  which could reduce our profitability 
we are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign laws  regulations  rules and ordinances relating to pollution  protection of the environment and human health  and the generation  storage  handling  transportation  treatment  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials 
actual or alleged violations of ehs laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations and substantial civil or criminal sanctions  as well as  under some ehs laws  the assessment of strict liability and or joint and several liability 
increasing concerns regarding the safety of chemicals in commerce and their potential impact on the environment constitute a growing trend 
governmental  regulatory and societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection could result in increased pressure for more stringent regulatory control with respect to the chemical industry 
in addition  these concerns could influence public perceptions  the viability of certain products  our reputation  the cost to comply with regulations  and the ability to attract and retain employees 
moreover  changes in ehs regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations  or require us to modify our facilities or operations 
accordingly  environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses  costs or liabilities  which could reduce our profitability 
we could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future ehs laws 
capital expenditures and costs relating to ehs matters will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on our operations 
capital expenditures and costs beyond those currently anticipated may therefore be required under existing or future ehs laws 

table of contents furthermore  we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our properties or at off site locations where we disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials or from disposal activities that pre dated our purchase of our businesses 
we may therefore incur additional costs and expenditures beyond those currently anticipated to address all such known and unknown situations under existing and future ehs laws 
we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems  and any failure to adequately protect our critical information technology systems could materially affect our operations 
we rely on information technology systems across our operations  including for management  supply chain and financial information and various other processes and transactions 
our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security  reliability and capacity of these systems 
information technology system failures  network disruptions or breaches of security could disrupt our operations  causing delays or cancellation of customer orders or impeding the manufacture or shipment of products  processing of transactions or reporting of financial results 
an attack or other problem with our systems could also result in the disclosure of proprietary information about our business or confidential information concerning our customers or employees  which could result in significant damage to our business and our reputation 
we have put in place security measures designed to protect against the misappropriation or corruption of our systems  intentional or unintentional disclosure of confidential information  or disruption of our operations 
current employees have  and former employees may have  access to a significant amount of information regarding our operations which could be disclosed to our competitors or otherwise used to harm us 
moreover  our operations in certain locations  such as china  may be particularly vulnerable to security attacks or other problems 
any breach of our security measures could result in unauthorized access to and misappropriation of our information  corruption of data or disruption of operations or transactions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we could be required to expend significant additional amounts to respond to information technology issues or to protect against threatened or actual security breaches 
we may not be able to implement measures that will protect against all of the significant risks to our information technology systems 
our business is dependent on our intellectual property 
if our intellectual property rights cannot be enforced or our trade secrets become known to our competitors  our ability to compete may be adversely affected 
proprietary protection of our processes  apparatuses and other technology is important to our business 
while a presumption of validity exists with respect to patents issued to us in the us  there can be no assurance that any of our patents will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
furthermore  if any pending patent application filed by us does not result in an issued patent  or if patents are issued to us  but such patents do not provide meaningful protection of our intellectual property  then our ability to compete may be adversely affected

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
while it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property  these confidentiality agreements may be breached  may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know how  or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized access  use or disclosure of our trade secrets and know how

table of contents obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means 
consequently  we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights 
we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation or infringement in countries where effective patent  trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property laws and judicial systems may be unavailable  or may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as us law

our production of mtbe may subject us to liability  and regulatory or market changes with respect to mtbe may materially reduce our sales and or materially increase our costs 
we produce mtbe  an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
because mtbe has contaminated some water supplies  its use has become controversial in the us and elsewhere  and its use has been effectively eliminated in the us market 
refiners  manufacturers and sellers of gasoline  as well as manufacturers of mtbe  have been named as defendants in numerous cases in us courts that allege mtbe contamination in groundwater 
plaintiffs in the mtbe groundwater contamination cases generally seek compensatory damages  punitive damages  injunctive relief such as monitoring and abatement and attorney fees 
between and  we were named as a defendant in of these lawsuits  which we settled in an amount immaterial to us 
it is possible that we could be named as a defendant in future mtbe litigation and  if so  that adverse results could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
we currently market mtbe  either directly or through third parties  to gasoline additive customers located outside the us such sales are less profitable compared to historical us sales because our shipping costs are higher 
legislative or regulatory initiatives further restricting mtbe could materially adversely affect our sales and costs 
while we could use all or a portion of our precursor tba to produce saleable products other than mtbe  this would require significant capital expenditures to modify our facilities 
moreover  the sale of other products would produce a lower level of cash flow than that historically produced from the sale of mtbe 
loss of key members of our management could disrupt our business 
we depend on the continued employment and performance of our senior executives and other key members of management 
if any of these individuals resigns or becomes unable to continue in his or her present role and is not adequately replaced  our business operations and our ability to implement our growth strategies could be materially disrupted 
we generally do not have employment agreements with  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance for  any of our executive officers 
conflicts  military actions  terrorist attacks and general instability  in particular in certain energy producing nations  along with increased security regulations related to our industry  could adversely affect our business 
conflicts  military actions and terrorist attacks have precipitated economic instability and turmoil in financial markets 
instability and turmoil  particularly in energy producing nations  may result in raw material cost increases 
the uncertainty and economic disruption resulting from hostilities  military action or acts of terrorism may impact any or all of our facilities and operations or those of our 
table of contents suppliers or customers 
accordingly  any conflict  military action or terrorist attack that impacts us or any of our suppliers or customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  a number of governments have instituted regulations attempting to increase the security of chemical plants and the transportation of hazardous chemicals  which could result in higher operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
if our subsidiaries do not make sufficient distributions to us  then we will not be able to make payment on our debts 
our debt is generally the exclusive obligation of huntsman international and our guarantor subsidiaries 
because a significant portion of our operations are conducted by non guarantor subsidiaries  our cash flow and our ability to service indebtedness  including our ability to pay the interest on our debt when due and principal of such debt at maturity  are dependent to a large extent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from such non guarantor subsidiaries 
any payment of dividends  distributions  loans or advances by our non guarantor subsidiaries to us could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law  monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate  and any restrictions imposed by the current and future debt instruments of our non guarantor subsidiaries 
in addition  payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings 
our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and  except for our guarantor subsidiaries  have no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to pay any amounts due on our debt or to make any funds available for those amounts  whether by dividends  loans  distributions or other payments  and do not guarantee the payment of interest on  or principal of  our debt 
any right that we have to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary  and the consequent right of holders of notes to realize proceeds from the sale of their assets  will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary s creditors  including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by that subsidiary 
regulatory requirements to reduce ghg emissions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
although the continued existence of binding emissions limitations under international treaties such as the kyoto protocol is in doubt after  we expect some of our operations to be subject to regulatory requirements to reduce ghg emissions 
even in the absence of a new global agreement to limit ghgs  we may be subject to additional regulation under the european union emissions trading system as well as new national and regional ghg trading programs 
for example  our operations in australia and selected us states may be subject to future ghg regulations under emissions trading systems in those jurisdictions 
because the us has not adopted federal climate change legislation  domestic ghg efforts are likely to be guided by epa and state agency regulations in the near future 
while epa s ghg programs are currently subject to judicial challenge  our domestic operations may become subject to epa s regulatory requirements when implemented 
in particular  expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the clean air act s prevention of significant deterioration requirements under epa s ghg tailoring rule 
in addition  certain aspects of our operations may be subject to ghg emissions monitoring and reporting requirements 
if we are subject to epa ghg regulations  we may face increased monitoring  reporting  and compliance costs 

table of contents we are already managing and reporting ghg emissions  to varying degrees  as required by law for our sites in locations subject to kyoto protocol obligations and or eu emissions trading scheme requirements 
although these sites are subject to existing ghg legislation  few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs  although it is possible that ghg emission restrictions may increase over time 
potential consequences of such restrictions include capital costs to modify operations as necessary to meet ghg emission limits and or additional in energy costs  as well as direct compliance costs 
currently  however  it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  droughts  floods and other climatic events 
if any of those effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our facilities and operations 
risks related to our common stock and debt securities our stock price has been and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations 
we have experienced significant fluctuations in our stock price and share trading volume in the past and may continue to do so 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of issues  including broad market factors that may have a material adverse impact on our stock price  regardless of actual performance 
the following factors could affect our stock price periodic variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of our business or that of our competitors  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates of our future operating results or of the future operating results of our competitors  material announcements by us or our competitors  public sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  and adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends or in conditions or trends in the markets in which we operate 
shares available for future sale may cause our common stock price to decline  which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock 
sales of substantial numbers of additional shares of our common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  may cause prevailing market prices for shares of our common stock to decline 
we have the ability to issue additional equity securities  which would lead to further dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock 
the issuance of additional equity securities would result in dilution of then existing stockholders equity interests in our company 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors  without stockholder approval  to establish one or more series of preferred stock and to determine  with respect to any series of preferred stock  the number of shares in that series and the terms  rights and limitations of that series 
if we issue convertible notes or convertible preferred stock  a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common stockholders interest 
our board of directors has no present intention of issuing any such convertible instruments  but reserves the right to do so in the future 
in addition  we may issue additional shares of common stock under our equity incentive plans 

table of contents certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover attempt  which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and  therefore  limit your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market value 
certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  such as a classified board of directors  limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders and the inability of stockholders to call special meetings and certain provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company  even if some of our stockholders considered such a change of control to be beneficial 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
therefore  our board of directors could elect to issue preferred stock that has special voting or other rights that could make it even more difficult for a third party to acquire us  which may reduce or eliminate your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market value 
the declaration of dividends by our company is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and limitations under delaware law  and there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends 
over the past four years we have paid quarterly dividends on our common stock 
the declaration of dividends by our company is subject to the discretion of our board of directors 
our board of directors takes into account such matters as general business conditions  our financial results  expected liquidity and capital expenditure requirements  contractual  legal or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends  the effect on our debt ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant  and we can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock 
in addition  delaware law contains certain restrictions on a company s ability to pay cash dividends and we can provide no assurance that those restrictions will not prevent us from paying a dividend in future periods

these cases are consolidated as the polyether polyols cases in multidistrict litigation pending in the us district court for the district of kansas 
in addition  we and the other polyether polyol defendants were named as defendants in three civil antitrust suits brought by certain direct purchasers of polyether polyol products that opted out of the class certified in the kansas multidistrict litigation 
the relevant time frame for these cases is to and they are referred to as the direct action cases 
the class action and the direct action cases were consolidated in the kansas court for the purposes of discovery and other pretrial matters 
in we settled both the class action and the direct action cases  and we have been dismissed as a defendant in both of those cases 
the class settlement obligates us to pay the class an additional million in each of and two similar civil antitrust class action cases were filed may and  in the superior court of justice  ontario canada and superior court  province of quebec  district of quebec  on behalf of purported classes of canadian direct and indirect purchasers of mdi  tdi and polyether polyols

the plaintiffs in this matter make similar claims against the defendants as the class plaintiffs in the kansas multidistrict litigation 

table of contents we have been named as a defendant in two purported class action civil antitrust suits alleging that we and our co defendants and other co conspirators conspired to fix prices of titanium dioxide sold in the us between at least march  and the present

a class certification hearing is scheduled for august  and trial is set to begin september  discovery is ongoing 
in all of the antitrust litigation currently pending against us  the plaintiffs generally are seeking injunctive relief  treble damages  costs of suit and attorneys fees 
we are not aware of any illegal conduct by us or any of our employees 
nevertheless  we have incurred costs relating to these claims and could incur additional costs in amounts material to us 
asbestos litigation we have been named as a premises defendant in a number of asbestos exposure cases  typically claims by nonemployees of exposure to asbestos while at a facility 
in the past  these cases typically have involved multiple plaintiffs bringing actions against multiple defendants  and the complaints have not indicated which plaintiffs were making claims against which defendants  where or how the alleged injuries occurred or what injuries each plaintiff claimed 
these facts  which would be central to any estimate of probable loss  generally have been learned only through discovery 
where a claimant s alleged exposure occurred prior to our ownership of the relevant premises  the prior owners generally have contractually agreed to retain liability for  and to indemnify us against  asbestos exposure claims 
this indemnification is not subject to any time or dollar amount limitations 
upon service of a complaint in one of these cases  we tender it to the prior owner 
rarely do the complaints in these cases state the amount of damages being sought 
the prior owner accepts responsibility for the conduct of the defense of the cases and payment of any amounts due to the claimants 
in our eighteen year experience with tendering these cases  we have not made any payment with respect to any tendered asbestos cases 
we believe that the prior owners have the intention and ability to continue to honor their indemnity obligations  although we cannot assure you that they will continue to do so or that we will not be liable for these cases if they do not 
the following table presents for the periods indicated certain information about cases for which service has been received that we have tendered to the prior owner  all of which have been accepted 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  unresolved at beginning of period tendered during period resolved during period unresolved at end of period although the indemnifying party informs us when tendered cases have been resolved  it generally does not inform us of the settlement amounts relating to such cases  if any 
the indemnifying party has informed us that it typically manages our defense together with the defense of other entities in such cases and resolves claims involving multiple defendants simultaneously  and that it considers the allocation of settlement amounts  if any  among defendants to be confidential and proprietary 
consequently  we are not able to provide the number of cases resolved with payment by the indemnifying party or the amount of such payments 

table of contents we have never made any payments with respect to these cases 
as of december   we had an accrued liability of million relating to these cases and a corresponding receivable of million relating to our indemnity protection with respect to these cases 
we cannot assure you that our liability will not exceed our accruals or that our liability associated with these cases would not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  accordingly  we are not able to estimate the amount or range of loss in excess of our accruals 
additional asbestos exposure claims may be made against us in the future  and such claims could be material 
however  because we are not able to estimate the amount or range of losses associated with such claims  we have made no accruals with respect to unasserted asbestos exposure claims as of december  certain cases in which we are a premises defendant are not subject to indemnification by prior owners or operators 
the following table presents for the periods indicated certain information about these cases 
cases include all cases for which service has been received by us

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products and of inorganic chemical products 
our products comprise a broad range of chemicals and formulations  which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers 
our products are used in a wide range of applications  including those in the adhesives  aerospace  automotive  construction products  durable and non durable consumer products  electronics  medical  packaging  paints and coatings  power generation  refining  synthetic fiber  textile chemicals and dye industries 
we are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines  including mdi  amines  surfactants  epoxy based polymer formulations  textile chemicals  dyes  maleic anhydride and titanium dioxide 
our administrative  research and development and manufacturing operations are primarily conducted at the facilities listed in item properties above  which are located in countries 
we employed approximately  associates worldwide at december  we operate in five segments polyurethanes  performance products  advanced materials  textile effects and pigments 
our polyurethanes  performance products  advanced materials and textile effects segments produce differentiated organic chemical products and our pigments segment produces inorganic chemical products 
in a series of transactions beginning in  we have sold or shutdown substantially all of our former australian styrenics operations and our north american polymers and base chemicals operations 
we report the results from these businesses as discontinued operations 
see note discontinued operations to our consolidated financial statements 
growth in our polyurethanes and advanced materials segments has been driven by the continued substitution of our products for other materials across a broad range of applications  as well as by the level of global economic activity 
historically  demand for many of these products has grown at rates in excess of gdp growth 
in polyurethanes  this growth  driven largely by asia  has in recent years resulted in improved demand and higher industry capacity utilization rates for many of our key products  including mdi 
in our performance products segment  demand for our performance specialties has generally continued to grow at rates in excess of gdp as overall demand is significantly influenced by new product and application development 
demand for most of our performance intermediates has grown in line with gdp growth 
over time  demand for maleic anhydride has generally grown at rates that slightly exceed gdp growth 
however  given its dependence on the upr market  which is influenced by construction end markets  maleic anhydride demand can be cyclical 
demand in our textile effects segment is driven primarily by consumer activity 
consumer spending for goods incorporating our textile effects products is impacted significantly by a wide range of economic factors  including personal incomes  housing and energy prices and other highly volatile 
table of contents factors 
accordingly  demand for our textile effects products has been volatile and appears likely to remain volatile 
historically  demand for titanium dioxide pigments has grown at rates approximately equal to global gdp growth 
pigment prices have historically reflected industry wide operating rates but have typically lagged behind movements in these rates by up to twelve months due to the effects of product stocking and destocking by customers and producers  contract arrangements and seasonality 
the industry experiences some seasonality in its sales because sales of paints  the largest end use for titanium dioxide  generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere 
this results in greater sales volumes in the second and third quarters of the year 
during  we expect to benefit from certain ore supply contracts in our pigments segment that will effectively supply approximately of our ore requirements at prices close to market levels  which are significantly below current market prices 
a majority of these contracts will expire at the end of  with the resulting benefits reflected through most of the first quarter of these contracts did not materially benefit our pigments segment during for further information regarding sales price and demand trends  see results of operations segment analysis year ended december  compared to year ended december  and the tables captioned year ended december  vs 
 period over period increase decrease and fourth quarter vs 
third quarter  period over period increase decrease below 
outlook demand for our products is generally sensitive to global economic growth 
our revenue is distributed approximately one third in north america  one third in europe  slightly less than one quarter in asia pacific and the balance in the rest of the world 
our operations in europe continue to be impacted by the uncertain european economy  and we expect slow growth across our businesses in europe 
growth in other regions for most of our products is expected to improve subject to seasonal demand fluctuations 
we anticipate that we will see an improving global economy from this point forward 
most of our businesses have strong upside potential as we see a continued recovery in the world s economy 
in  we expect margin pressure on our pigments segment to be offset by improved earnings in our other segments 
the following summarizes key considerations that could impact future performance of our operating segments polyurethanes improving mdi margins improving mdi demand continued strength in po mtbe margins improving global economic environment performance products us gulf coast raw material cost advantage near term amines margin pressure improving global economic environment 
table of contents advanced materials reorganization and restructuring benefit improving global economic environment textile effects restructuring benefits beginning in the second half of improving global economic environment pigments improving sales portfolio higher raw material costs favorable ore contracts expiring at end of improving global economic environment we expect to spend approximately million in on capital expenditures  net of reimbursements  largely for growth initiatives and maintenance

we believe that ebitda supplements an investor s understanding of our financial performance 
however  ebitda should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international llc  as appropriate  or other measures of performance as defined by gaap 
moreover  ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
our management uses ebitda to assess financial performance by reviewing ebitda as a general indicator of economic performance compared with prior periods 
because ebitda excludes interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  ebitda provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected 
table of contents by debt restructurings  fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates  or levels of depreciation and amortization 
accordingly  our management believes this type of measurement is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period and making certain related management decisions 
ebitda is also used by securities analysts  lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry 
for example  interest expense can be highly dependent on a company s capital structure  debt levels and credit ratings 
therefore  the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies 
in addition  the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate 
as a result  effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies 
finally  companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets 
this can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies 
nevertheless  our management recognizes that there are material limitations associated with the use of ebitda in the evaluation of our company as compared to net income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international llc  as appropriate  which reflects overall financial performance  including the effects of interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda excludes interest expense 
because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations 
ebitda also excludes taxes 
because the payment of taxes is a necessary element of our operations  any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations 
finally  ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization expense 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization expense has material limitations 
our management compensates for the limitations of using ebitda by using it to supplement gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business rather than gaap results alone 
our management also uses other metrics to evaluate capital structure  tax planning and capital investment decisions 
for example  our management uses credit ratings and net debt ratios to evaluate capital structure  effective tax rate by jurisdiction to evaluate tax planning  and payback period and internal rate of return to evaluate capital investments 
our management also uses trade working capital to evaluate its investment in accounts receivable and inventory  net of accounts payable 
adjusted ebitda is computed by eliminating the following from ebitda loss on early extinguishment of debt  legal settlements  loss on accounts receivable securitization program  ebitda from discontinued operations  acquisition expenses  expenses income associated with the terminated merger and related litigation huntsman corporation only  gains on the sales of businesses and assets  extraordinary gain loss on the acquisition of a business  gain on consolidation of a variable interest entity and restructuring  impairment and plant closing costs credits 
in prior reports  we excluded unallocated foreign exchange gains or losses in our presentation of adjusted ebitda 
in our current and future presentations of adjusted ebitda we do not exclude unallocated foreign exchange gains or losses 
the amounts for prior periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation 
we made this change to more accurately reflect the ongoing cost of operating a global business 
adjusted ebitda is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to ebitda and reported gaap measures because we believe that it is indicative of our operating performance and is frequently used as a valuation measure of chemical companies 
our management also uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate the core operating performance of our segments and business 

table of contents in addition to the limitations of ebitda noted above  adjusted ebitda excludes items that may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance 
however  we believe it is useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to other periods for the following reasons certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events  and the variability of such items may not relate specifically to current operating results or trends  and certain excluded items  while potentially recurring in future periods  may not be indicative of future results 
adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to net income applicable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international  as appropriate  as an indicator of performance  or as any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe that net income loss attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international  as appropriate  is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap that is most directly comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda

the income tax impacts of each adjusting item is calculated using the statutory rates in the applicable taxing jurisdiction and considering valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction 
we do not adjust for changes in tax valuation allowances because we do not believe it provides more meaningful information than is provided under gaap 
basic adjusted income loss per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing adjusted net income loss by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period 
diluted income loss per share reflects all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and is computed by dividing adjusted net income loss by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding as dilutive securities 
in prior reports  we excluded unallocated foreign exchange gains or losses in our presentation of adjusted net income loss

on september   our australian subsidiary entered into an amendment with the lender to modify certain terms of the credit facility 
during the third quarter of  we incurred other debt related to the financing of our insurance premiums in connection with our annual renewal in july as of december   the outstanding amount of financed insurance premiums was million  all of which was classified as current portion of debt on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
note payable from huntsman international to huntsman corporation as of december   we had a loan of million to our subsidiary  huntsman international the intercompany note 
the intercompany note is unsecured and million of the outstanding amount is classified as current as of december  on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   under the terms of the intercompany note  huntsman international promises to pay us interest on the unpaid principal amount at a rate per annum based on the previous monthly average borrowing rate obtained under our us a r program  less basis points provided that the rate shall not exceed an amount that is basis points less than the monthly average borrowing rate obtained for the us libor based borrowings under our revolving facility 
compliance with covenants we believe that we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our material debt instruments  including our senior credit facilities  our a r programs and our notes 
our material financing arrangements contain certain covenants with which we must comply 
a failure to comply with a covenant could result in a default under a financing arrangement if not waived or amended 
a default under these material financing arrangements generally allows debt holders the option to declare the underlying debt obligations immediately due and payable 
furthermore  certain of our material financing arrangements contain cross default and cross acceleration provisions under which a failure to comply with the covenants in one financing arrangement may result in an event of default under another financing arrangement 
our senior credit facilities are subject to a single financial covenant the leverage covenant which applies only to the revolving facility and is tested at the huntsman international level 
the leverage covenant is applicable only if borrowings  letters of credit or guarantees are outstanding under the revolving facility cash collateralized letters of credit or guarantees are not deemed outstanding 
the leverage covenant is a net senior secured leverage ratio covenant which requires that huntsman international s ratio of senior secured debt to ebitda as defined in the applicable agreement is not more than to if in the future huntsman international failed to comply with the leverage covenant  then we may not have access to liquidity under our revolving facility 
if huntsman international failed to comply with the leverage covenant at a time when we had uncollateralized loans or letters of credit outstanding under the revolving facility  huntsman international would be in default under the senior credit facilities  and  unless huntsman international obtained a waiver or forbearance with respect to such default as to which we can provide no assurance  huntsman international could be required to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full  and we may not have further access to such facilities 
the agreements governing our a r programs also contain certain receivable performance metrics 
any material failure to meet the applicable a r programs metrics in the future could lead to an early termination event under the a r programs  which could require us to cease our use of such facilities  prohibiting us from additional borrowings against our receivables or  at the discretion of the lenders  requiring that we repay the a r programs in full 
an early termination event under the a r programs 
table of contents would also constitute an event of default under our senior credit facilities  which could require us to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full and could result in the loss of our senior credit facilities 
short term and long term liquidity we depend upon our cash  credit facilities  a r programs and other debt instruments to provide liquidity for our operations and working capital needs 
as of december   we had  million of combined cash and unused borrowing capacity  consisting of million in cash and restricted cash  million in availability under our revolving facility  and million in availability under our a r programs 
as of december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  including restricted cash  held by our foreign subsidiaries  including our variable interest entities 
our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations  but should we need to repatriate this cash by way of dividends we could be subject to certain adverse tax consequences 
for more information  see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 
cash held by certain foreign subsidiaries  including our variable interest entities vies  may also be subject to legal restrictions  including those arising from the interests of our partners  which could limit the amounts available for repatriation

these repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice 
as of december   we had million classified as current portion of debt which consists of certain scheduled term payments and various short term facilities including an hps borrowing facility in china with million outstanding  our australian credit facilities with million classified as current  our scheduled senior credit facilities amortization payments in totaling million  and certain other short term facilities and scheduled amortization payments totaling million

we have various purchase commitments extending through for materials  supplies and services entered into in the ordinary course of business 
included in the purchase commitments table above are contracts which require minimum volume purchases that extend beyond one year or are renewable annually and have been renewed for certain contracts allow for changes in minimum required purchase volumes in the event of a temporary or permanent shutdown of a facility 
to the extent the contract requires a minimum notice period  such notice period has been included in the above table 
the contractual purchase price for substantially all of these contracts is variable based upon market prices  subject to annual negotiations 
we have estimated our contractual obligations by using the terms of our pricing for each contract 
we also have a limited number of contracts which require a minimum payment even if no volume is purchased 
we believe that all of our purchase obligations will be utilized in our normal operations

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
summarized below are our critical accounting policies employee benefit programs we sponsor several contributory and non contributory defined benefit plans  covering employees primarily in the us  the us  the netherlands  belgium and switzerland  but also covering employees in a number of other countries 
we fund the material plans through trust arrangements or local equivalents where the assets are held separately from us 
we also sponsor unfunded postretirement plans which provide medical and life insurance benefits covering certain employees in the us and canada 
amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements are recorded based upon actuarial valuations performed by various independent actuaries 
inherent in these valuations are numerous assumptions regarding expected return on assets  discount rates  compensation increases  mortality rates and health care costs trends 
these assumptions are disclosed in note employee benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements 
management  with the advice of its actuaries  uses judgment to make assumptions on which our employee pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expenses are based 
the effect of a change in three key assumptions is summarized as follows dollars in millions assumptions statement of operations balance sheet impact discount rate increase decrease expected return on assets increase decrease rate of compensation increase increase decrease estimated increase decrease on net periodic benefit cost estimated increase decrease on december  pension and postretirement liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss income environmental reserves environmental remediation costs for our facilities are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of environmental reserves require evaluating government regulation  available technology  site specific information and remediation alternatives 
we accrue an amount equal to our best estimate of the costs to remediate based upon the available information 
the extent of environmental damage may not be fully known and the processes and costs of remediation may change as new information is obtained or technology for remediation is improved 
our process for estimating the expected cost for remediation considers the information available  technology that can be utilized and estimates of the extent of environmental damage 
adjustments to our estimates are made periodically based upon additional information

fair value pursuant to the texas bank litigation settlement agreement  on june   huntsman international entered into an amendment of its senior credit facilities that provided for term loan c with a million principal amount  and huntsman international also issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
in accordance with accounting guidance regarding fair value measurements  we recorded the term loan c and the senior notes in our accounting records at fair values of million and million  respectively  upon initial recognition in june we primarily used the income approach to determine the fair value of these instruments 
fair value represents the present value of estimated future cash flows calculated using interest rates that were available to us for issuance of debt with similar terms  adjusted for differences in remaining maturity using relevant debt yield curves 
management used judgment with respect to assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the term loan c and the senior notes 
the effect of the following changes in certain key assumptions is summarized as follows dollars in millions assumptions balance sheet impact effective market yield increase decrease estimated increase decrease to june fair values of term loan c and senior notes we primarily used the income approach to determine the fair value of the convertible notes 
fair value is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  calculated using management s best estimates of key assumptions including relevant interest rates  expected share volatility  dividend yields  and the probabilities associated with certain features of the convertible notes 
we also used the market approach to assess comparables and corroborate the fair value determined using the income approach 
goodwill we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually at the beginning of the third quarter and when events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing 
currently  substantially all of our goodwill balance relates to our advanced materials reporting unit 
fair value is estimated using the market approach  as well as the income approach based on discounted cash flow projections 
the estimated fair values of our reporting units are dependent on several significant assumptions including  among others  market information  operating results  earnings projections and anticipated future cash flows 
we tested goodwill for impairment at the beginning of the third quarter of as part of the annual impairment testing procedures and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
our most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of our advanced materials reporting unit by a substantial margin 
the goodwill associated with our maleic anhydride reporting unit within our performance products division was recorded at fair value during 
table of contents the second quarter of when sasol huntsman was first consolidated  approximately three months before our annual impairment testing took place 
as such  no detailed impairment analysis was performed for the goodwill in this reporting unit at the beginning of the third quarter of given the profitability in our maleic anhydride business  we believe that if a detailed analysis had been performed it would not have resulted in an impairment of this goodwill 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes 
we evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
valuation allowances are reviewed on a tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction 
these conclusions require significant judgment 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider the cyclicality of businesses and cumulative income or losses during the applicable period 
cumulative losses incurred over the period limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for the future changes in expected future income in applicable jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions 
as of december   we had total valuation allowances of million 
please see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our valuation allowances 
for non us entities that were not treated as branches for us tax purposes  the company does not provide for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries as earnings are reinvested and  in the opinion of management  will continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are deemed to be permanently invested were approximately million at december  it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings 
we have material inter company debt obligations owed by our non us subsidiaries to the us the company does not intend to repatriate earnings to the us via dividend based on estimates of future domestic cash generation and our ability to return cash to the us through payments of inter company debt owned by our non us subsidiaries to the non us to the extent that cash is required in the us  rather than repatriate earnings to the us via dividend we will utilize our inter company debt 
if any earnings were repatriated via dividend  the company would need to accrue and pay taxes on the distributions 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
we are required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of more likely than not to be realized based on the merits of the position under tax law  in order to recognize an income tax benefit 
this requires us to make many assumptions and judgments regarding the merits of income tax positions and the application of income tax law 
additionally  if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more likely than not we are required to make judgments and assumptions to measure the amount of the tax benefits to recognize based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing authorities 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as a consequence  changes in assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using lifo  first in first out  and average cost methods for different components of inventory 
market is determined based on net realizable value for finished goods inventories and replacement cost for raw materials and work in process inventories 
in periods of declines in the selling prices of our finished products  inventory carrying values may exceed the net realizable value upon sale  resulting in a lower of cost or market charge 
we evaluate the need for a lower of cost or market adjustment to inventories based on the period end selling prices of our finished products 
long lived assets the useful lives of our property  plant and equipment are estimated based upon our historical experience  engineering estimates and industry information and are reviewed when economic events indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of the assets 
the estimated lives of our property range from to years and depreciation is recorded on the straight line method 
inherent in our estimates of useful lives is the assumption that periodic maintenance and an appropriate level of annual capital expenditures will be performed 
without on going capital improvements and maintenance  the productivity and cost efficiency declines and the useful lives of our assets would be shorter 
management uses judgment to estimate the useful lives of our long lived assets 
at december   if the estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment had either been one year greater or one year less than their recorded lives  then depreciation expense for would have been approximately million less or million greater  respectively 
we are required to evaluate the carrying value of our plant assets whenever events indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable in the future or when management s plans change regarding those assets  such as idling or closing a plant 
we evaluate impairment by comparing undiscounted cash flows of the related asset groups that are largely independent of the cash flows of other asset groups to their carrying values 
key assumptions in determining the future cash flows include the useful life  technology  competitive pressures  raw material pricing and regulations 
in connection with our asset evaluation policy  we reviewed all of our long lived assets for indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
with the exception of the long lived assets at our textile effects basel  switzerland manufacturing facility  we determined that such indicators did not exist during the year ended december  in connection with the announced plans to significantly restructure the textile effects business  we recorded a charge of million for the impairment of long lived assets at our basel  switzerland manufacturing facility in the third quarter of for further discussion of this impairment charge  see note restructuring  impairment and plant closing costs to our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and plant closing costs we have recorded restructuring charges in recent periods in connection with closing certain plant locations  workforce reductions and other cost savings programs primarily in our textile effects  advanced materials and pigments segments 
these charges are recorded when management has committed to a plan and incurred a liability related to the plan 
estimates for plant closing costs include the write off of the carrying value of the plant  any necessary environmental and or regulatory costs  contract termination and demolition costs 
estimates for workforce reductions and other costs savings are recorded based upon estimates of the number of positions to be terminated  termination benefits to be provided and other information  as necessary 
management evaluates the estimates on a quarterly basis and will adjust the reserve when information indicates that the estimate is above or 
table of contents below the currently recorded estimate 
for further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note restructuring  impairment and plant closing costs to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate substantially all of our revenues through sales in the open market and long term supply agreements 
we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue for product sales is recognized when a sales arrangement exists  risk and title to the product transfer to the customer  collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable 
the transfer of risk and title to the product to the customer usually occurs at the time shipment is made 
revenue arrangements that contain multiple deliverables  which relate primarily to the licensing of technology  are evaluated in accordance with asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  to determine whether the arrangements should be divided into separate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated among the separate units of accounting 
variable interest entities primary beneficiary we evaluate each of our variable interest entities on an on going basis to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary 
management assesses  on an on going basis  the nature of our relationship to the variable interest entity  including the amount of control that we exercise over the entity as well as the amount of risk that we bear and rewards we receive in regards to the entity  to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity 
management judgment is required to assess whether these attributes are significant 
we consolidate all variable interest entities for which we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  such as changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity pricing risks 
from time to time  we enter into transactions  including transactions involving derivative instruments  to manage certain of these exposures 
we also hedge our net investment in certain european operations 
changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain european operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
interest rate risks through our borrowing activities  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
such risk arises due to the structure of our debt portfolio  including the duration of the portfolio and the mix of fixed and floating interest rates 
actions taken to reduce interest rate risk include managing the mix and rate characteristics of various interest bearing liabilities  as well as entering into interest rate derivative instruments 
from time to time  we may purchase interest rate swaps and or interest rate collars to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating rate long term debt 
under interest rate swaps  we agree with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount 
the collars entitle us to receive from the counterparties major banks the amounts  if any  by which our interest payments on certain of our floating rate borrowings exceed a certain rate  and require us to pay to the counterparties major banks the amount  if any  by which our interest payments on certain of our floating rate borrowings are less than a certain rate 
on december   we entered into a five year interest rate contract to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to associated changes in libor under our senior credit

for the years ended december  and  the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss income associated with these cash flow hedging activities was approximately million and million  respectively 
during  accumulated other comprehensive income loss of nil is expected to be reclassified to earnings 
the actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months may vary from this amount due to changing market conditions 
we would be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments 
we anticipate  however  that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
market risk arises from changes in interest rates 

table of contents foreign exchange rate risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation 
our revenues and expenses are denominated in various currencies 
we enter into foreign currency derivative instruments to minimize the short term impact of movements in foreign currency rates 
where practicable  we generally net multicurrency cash balances among our subsidiaries to help reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
certain other exposures may be managed from time to time through financial market transactions  principally through the purchase of spot or forward foreign exchange contracts generally with maturities of three months or less 
we do not hedge our currency exposures in a manner that would eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates on our cash flows and earnings 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million notional amount in us dollar equivalents outstanding  respectively  in foreign currency contracts with a term of approximately one month 
in conjunction with the issuance of our senior subordinated notes due  we entered into cross currency interest rate contracts with three counterparties 
on march   we made payments of million to these counterparties and received million from these counterparties  and on maturity march  we are required to pay million to these counterparties and will receive million from these counterparties

we manage the net foreign currency exposure created by this debt through various means  including cross currency swaps  the designation of certain intercompany loans as permanent loans because they are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future permanent loans and the designation of certain debt and swaps as net investment hedges 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are not designated as permanent loans are recorded in earnings 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are designated as permanent loans are recorded in other comprehensive income 
from time to time  we review such designation of intercompany loans 
we review our non us dollar denominated debt to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges

as of december   we had approximately  million approximately  million in net euro assets 

table of contents commodity prices risk our exposure to changing commodity prices is somewhat limited since the majority of our raw materials are acquired at posted or market related prices  and sales prices for many of our finished products are at market related prices which are largely set on a monthly or quarterly basis in line with industry practice 
consequently  we do not generally hedge our commodity exposures
