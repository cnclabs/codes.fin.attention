display page views is defined as the total number of page views on yahoo properties less the number of search page views on yahoo properties  and revenue per display page view is defined as display revenue divided by our display page views

we began to consolidate and exit selected facilities beginning in the fourth quarter of and continued this process through the second quarter of we vacated and ceased use of the facilities identified under the plan 
non cancelable lease costs were determined based on the present value of remaining lease payments reduced by estimated sublease income 
present value computations use discount rates based on published treasury risk free interest rates  adjusted for our credit spread  which is consistent with observable credit spreads of companies with similar credit standing 
the cost of exiting and terminating our facility leases was determined by referring to the contractual terms of the agreements  by evaluating the current real estate market conditions  and  where applicable  by referring to amounts in negotiation 
our ability to generate the estimated amounts of sublease income  as well as to terminate lease obligations at the estimated amounts  is dependent upon the commercial real estate market conditions in certain geographies at the time we negotiate the lease termination and sublease arrangements with third parties 
these amounts represent our best estimate of the obligations we expect to incur and could be subject to adjustment as market conditions change 
the fair value measurement of the liability related to exited facilities involves the use of certain significant unobservable inputs and therefore falls within level of the fair value hierarchy established by accounting guidance described in note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the remaining lease obligations will be settled over the remaining lease terms which expire through fiscal and will be adjusted for changes in estimates or the impact of sublease contracts

the gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december  decreased by million from the recorded balance as of december  due to favorable settlements of tax audits in since there can be no assurance as to the outcome of tax audits currently in progress  it is reasonably possible that over the next twelve month period we may experience an increase or decrease in our unrecognized tax benefits 
it is not possible to determine either the magnitude or the range of any increase or decrease at this time 
during the last quarter of  we commenced discussions with the irs appeals division to settle the contested adjustments for certain intercompany transfer pricing matters from the and income tax examination 
while no agreement has been reached  the discussions are proceeding 
if the matter is resolved on the basis that 
table of contents is currently being discussed with the irs  then the settlement will not cause us to have tax exposure beyond what has already been provided 
in addition  our and us income tax returns are still under irs examination 
as of december   we were also under audit by the california franchise tax board for our and tax returns 
we believe our existing reserves for all tax matters are adequate 
we are in various stages of examination and appeal in connection with our taxes in foreign jurisdictions  which generally span tax years through it is difficult to determine when these examinations will be settled or what their final outcomes will be 
we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable adjustment and that any settlement will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

global operating costs include product development  service engineering and operations  marketing  customer advocacy  general and administrative  and other corporate expenses that are managed on a global basis and that are not directly attributable to any particular segment 
the net cost reimbursements from microsoft are primarily included in global operating costs for the years ended december  and americas 
americas revenue ex tac for the year ended december  decreased million  or percent  compared to our year over year decrease in revenue ex tac was primarily due to a decline in search  display  and other revenue 
search revenue ex tac decreased due to the revenue share with microsoft associated with the search agreement as well as declines in our affiliate search revenue as a result of the microsoft transition 
display revenue ex tac decreased due to declines in guaranteed advertising 
other revenue decreased due to changes in certain of our broadband access partnerships  a shift from a fee paying user structure to other fee structures  and the divestiture of certain business lines during the year ended december  for the year ended december   direct costs attributable to the americas segment decreased million  or percent  compared to the decrease is primarily due to lower compensation costs offset slightly by higher content costs 

table of contents americas revenue ex tac for the year ended december  decreased million  or percent  compared to our year over year decrease in revenue ex tac was a result of a decline in our search advertising business and our fee based services  partially offset by an increase in our display advertising business 
search revenue ex tac decreased due to the revenue share with microsoft associated with the search agreement and the impact of discontinuing our paid inclusion search product in late as part of our advertising quality initiatives 
these decreases were offset by an increase in display revenue ex tac driven by increased advertising spending and a shift towards higher yielding display inventory by our customers 
for the year ended december   direct costs attributable to the americas segment decreased million  or percent  compared to the decrease is primarily due to lower costs for other costs of revenue including credit card costs and content costs

our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
revenue ex tac and related expenses generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include australian dollars  british pounds  euros  japanese yen  korean won  
table of contents and taiwan dollars 
the statements of income of our international operations are translated into us dollars at exchange rates indicative of market rates during each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced consolidated revenue and operating expenses 
conversely  our consolidated revenue and operating expenses will increase if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
using the foreign currency exchange rates from the year ended december   revenue ex tac for the americas segment for the year ended december  would have been lower than we reported by million  revenue ex tac for the emea segment would have been lower than we reported by million  and revenue ex tac for the asia pacific segment would have been lower than we reported by million 
using the foreign currency exchange rates from the year ended december   direct costs for the americas segment for the year ended december  would have been lower than we reported by million  direct costs for the emea segment would have been lower than we reported by million  and direct costs for the asia pacific segment would have been lower than we reported by million

currently  we do not anticipate a need to repatriate these funds for use in our us operations 
we invest excess cash predominantly in marketable debt securities  money market funds  and time deposits that are liquid  highly rated  and the majority of which have effective maturities of less than one year 
our marketable debt and equity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
realized gains or losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary  if any  on available for sale securities are reported in other income  net 
the fair value for securities is determined based on quoted market prices of the historical underlying security or from readily available pricing sources for the identical underlying securities that may not be actively traded as of the valuation date 
as of december   certain of our marketable debt securities had a fair

we monitor our exposure to european markets  and as of december  we do not have any material direct exposure to european sovereign debt securities 
we invest a portion of excess operating cash in money market funds denominated in euros and british pounds  and through some of these funds we may have immaterial indirect exposure to high credit quality european sovereign debt securities 
we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity because we believe that internally generated cash flows are sufficient to support our business operations and capital expenditures 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable debt securities  together with any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements including capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
however  we may sell additional equity  or debt securities  or obtain credit facilities to further enhance our liquidity position  and the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders

we are committed to make certain payments under various intellectual property arrangements of up to million through other commitments 
in the ordinary course of business  we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers  vendors  lessors  joint venture and business partners  purchasers of assets or subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters  including  but not limited to  losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us  services to be provided by us  intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties or  with respect to the sale of assets or a subsidiary  matters related to our conduct of the business and tax matters prior to the sale 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us  among other things  to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers 
we have also agreed to indemnify certain former officers  directors  and employees of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies 
we maintain director and officer insurance  which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers and former directors and officers of acquired companies  in certain circumstances 
it is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
such indemnification agreements might not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and 
table of contents liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure below 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenue is generated from display  search  and other 
display revenue is generated from the display of graphical advertisements and search revenue is generated from the display of text based links to an advertiser s website and from revenue sharing arrangements with partners for search technology and services 
other revenue consists of listings based services revenue  transaction revenue  and fees revenue 
while the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions  there are certain transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions 
in addition  we enter into certain sales transactions that involve multiple elements arrangements with more than one deliverable 
we also enter into arrangements to purchase goods and or services from certain customers 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including whether an arrangement exists  whether fees are fixed or determinable  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple elements  establishing selling prices for deliverables considering multiple factors  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  whether the arrangement should be reported gross as a principal versus net as an agent  whether we receive a separately identifiable benefit from the purchase arrangements with certain customers for which we can reasonably estimate fair value  and whether the consideration received from a vendor should be characterized as revenue or a reimbursement of costs incurred 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are in accordance with applicable tax laws 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  new tax legislation  or the change of an estimate based on new information 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest and penalties 
we record a valuation allowance against certain of our deferred income tax assets if it is more likely than not that those assets will not be realized 
in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred income tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our operating results  ongoing tax planning  and forecasts of 
table of contents future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize these deferred income tax assets in the future  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance  which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
the performance of the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step involves comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit to its implied fair value 
an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value 
our reporting units are based on geography  either at the operating segment level or one level below operating segments 
the fair values of our reporting units are estimated using an average of a market approach and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants and is consistent with the methodology used for the goodwill impairment test in prior years 
in addition  we ensure that the fair values estimated under these two approaches are comparable with each other 
under the market approach  we utilize publicly traded comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples that are used to value our reporting units adjusted for an estimated control premium 
under the income approach  we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital  reflecting the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including selection of market comparables  estimated future cash flows  and discount rates 
these components are discussed below market comparables we select comparable companies in the specific regions in which our reporting units operate based on similarity of type of business  primarily those involved in online advertising  relative size  financial profile  and other characteristics of those companies compared to our reporting units 
trailing and forward revenue and earnings multiples derived from these comparable companies are applied to financial metrics of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair values  adjusted for an estimated control premium 
estimated future cash flows we base cash flow projections for each reporting unit using a five year forecast of cash flows and a terminal value based on the perpetuity growth model 
the five year forecast and related assumptions were derived from the most recent annual financial forecast for which the planning process commenced in our fourth quarter 
key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include  among other items  revenue and operating expense growth rates  terminal value growth rate  and capital expenditure and working capital levels 
discount rates we employ a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determine the discount rates used in our cash flow projections 
the determination of the discount rates for each reporting unit includes factors such as the risk free rate of return and the return an outside investor would expect to earn based on the overall level of inherent risk 
the determination of expected returns includes consideration of the beta a measure of risk of traded securities of comparable companies and risk premiums of reporting units based on international cost of capital methods 
the sum of the fair values of our reporting units is reconciled to our market capitalization after considering an estimated control premium 
we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test as of october  and determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore goodwill in those reporting units was not impaired 

table of contents significant management judgment is involved in determining these estimates and assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit which could trigger future impairment 
long lived assets 
we amortize long lived assets over their estimated useful lives 
identifiable long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value 
fair value is determined based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future cash flows using discount rates determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our long lived assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
different assumptions and judgments could materially affect estimated future cash flows relating to our long lived assets which could trigger impairment 
no impairments of long lived assets were identified during any of the periods presented 
investments in equity interests 
we account for investments in the common stock of entities in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control using the equity method 
in accounting for these investments we record our proportionate share of the entities net income or loss  one quarter in arrears 
we review our investments in equity interests for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable 
investments identified as having an indication of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the impairment is other than temporary and this analysis requires estimating the fair value of the investment 
the determination of fair value of the investment involves considering factors such as the stock prices of public companies in which we have an equity investment  current economic and market conditions  the operating performance of the companies  including current earnings trends and forecasted cash flows  and other company and industry specific information 
the fair value determination  particularly for investments in privately held companies  requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of whether any identified impairment is other than temporary 
stock based compensation expense 
we recognize stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and therefore only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award 
calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the stock based options  stock price volatility  and the pre vesting award forfeiture rate 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock  with a term of one year or greater 
we believe that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on our common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility 
therefore  expected volatility for the year ended december  was based on a market based implied volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected pre vesting award forfeiture rate  as well as the probability that performance conditions that affect the vesting of certain awards will be achieved  and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate this forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock based awards that are granted and cancelled before vesting 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our original estimates  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly 
table of contents different from what we have recorded in the current period 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense  as the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all current and previously recognized expense for unvested awards is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
in addition  because many of our stock based awards have vesting schedules of two or three years cliff vests  a significant change in our actual or expected forfeiture experience will result in the adjustment of stock based compensation which was recorded in prior years for all unvested awards 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to lower the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and marketable debt securities portfolio 
we invest excess cash in money market funds  time deposits  and liquid debt instruments of the us and foreign governments and their agencies  us municipalities  and high credit corporate issuers which are classified as marketable debt securities and cash equivalents 
investments in fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december  and  we had investments in short term marketable debt securities of approximately million and billion  respectively 
such investments had a weighted average yield of less than percent for both periods 
as of december  and  we had investments in long term marketable debt securities of approximately million and million  respectively 
such investments had a weighted average yield of less than percent for and approximately percent for a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in a million and million decrease in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities as of december  and  respectively 
foreign currency exposure 
our foreign currency exposure continues to increase as we grow internationally 
the objective of our foreign exchange risk management program is to identify material foreign currency exposures and identify methods to manage these exposures to minimize the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations 
economic exposure we transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues  as well as costs denominated in foreign currencies 
this exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our objective is to identify material foreign currency exposures and to manage these exposures to minimize the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flow and results of operations 

table of contents transaction exposure our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is the result of assets and liabilities  including inter company transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
in certain circumstances  changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
we may enter into derivative instruments  such as foreign currency forward contracts or other instruments to minimize the short term foreign currency fluctuations on such assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts may not offset any or more than a portion of the transaction gains and losses on certain foreign currency receivables  investments and payables recognized in earnings 
transaction gains and losses on these foreign exchange contracts are recognized each period in other income  net included on the consolidated statements of income 
during the years ended december    and  we recorded net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains of million and million  and a transaction loss of million  respectively 
as of december   we had an outstanding forward contract with a notional value equivalent of approximately million  which will mature on april  translation exposure we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries and our investments in equity interests into us dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars results in a gain or loss which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income which is part of stockholders equity 
revenue ex tac and related expenses generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include australian dollars  british pounds  euros  japanese yen  korean won  and taiwan dollars 
the statements of income of our international operations are translated into us dollars at exchange rates indicative of market rates during each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced consolidated revenue and operating expenses 
conversely  our consolidated revenue and operating expenses will increase if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
using the foreign currency exchange rates from the year ended december   revenue ex tac for the americas segment for the year ended december  would have been lower than we reported by million  revenue ex tac for the emea segment would have been lower than we reported by million  and revenue ex tac for the asia pacific segment would have been lower than we reported by million 
using the foreign currency exchange rates from the year ended december   direct costs for the americas segment for the year ended december  would have been lower than we reported by million  direct costs for the emea segment would have been lower than we reported by million  and direct costs for the asia pacific segment would have been lower than we reported by million 
investment exposure 
we are exposed to investment risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we have investments in marketable debt securities and equity instruments of public and private companies 
our cash and marketable debt securities investment policy and strategy attempts primarily to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements 
a large portion of our cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of our investment policy 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market  and reinvestment risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of liquid fixed income securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of december  and  net unrealized gains and losses on these investments were not material 

table of contents we invest in equity instruments of public companies for business and strategic purposes and have classified these securities as available for sale or investment in equity interests 
these investments may be subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market and the industries in which these companies participate 
our investments in available for sale equity securities were immaterial as of december  and  respectively 
our realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale equity securities were not material in and  respectively
