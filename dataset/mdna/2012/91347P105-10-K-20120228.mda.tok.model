item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled selected financial data in this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes to this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully discussed in item a of this report  entitled risk factors 
overview we are a leader in the research  development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode  or oled  technologies for use in flat panel display  solid state lighting and other applications 
since  we have been exclusively engaged  and expect to continue to be exclusively engaged  in funding and performing research and development activities relating to oled technologies and materials  and in attempting to commercialize these technologies and materials 
we derive our revenue from the following intellectual property and technology licensing  sales of oled materials for evaluation  development and commercial manufacturing  and technology development and support  including government contract work and support provided to third parties for commercialization of their oled products 
while we have made significant progress over the past few years developing and commercializing our family of oled technologies pholed  toled  foled  etc 
and materials  we have incurred significant losses since our inception  resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of december  
table of contents we anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties  as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation  the timing and volume of sales of our oled materials  the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development activities  and the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred license fees  stock based compensation and accounting for warrants and our supplemental executive retirement plan  as described below  are our critical accounting policies as contemplated by the sec 
these policies  which have been reviewed with our audit committee  are discussed in greater detail below 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from government contracts  development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees  which includes reimbursements by the us government for all or a portion of the research and development expenses we incur related to our government contracts 
revenue is recognized proportionally as research and development expenses are incurred or as defined milestones are achieved 
in order to ascertain the revenue associated with these contracts for a period  we estimate the proportion of related research and development expenses incurred and whether defined milestones have been achieved 
different estimates would result in different revenues for the period 
we receive non refundable cash payments under certain commercial  development and technology evaluation agreements with our customers 
these payments are generally recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement 
on occasion  however  certain of the payments under development and evaluation agreements are creditable against license fees and or royalties payable by the customer if a commercial license agreement is subsequently executed with the customer 
these payments are classified as deferred revenues  and are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet until such time as revenue can be recognized 
revenue is deferred until a commercial license agreement is executed or negotiations have ceased and there is no appreciable likelihood of executing a commercial license agreement with the customer 
if a commercial license agreement is executed  payments are recorded as revenue over the term of the agreement or the estimated useful life of the licensed technology  for perpetual licenses  and the revenue is classified based on the terms of the license 
otherwise  payments deferred pending a commercial license are recorded as revenue at the time negotiations with the customer show that there is no appreciable likelihood of executing a commercial license agreement 
if we used different estimates for the useful life of the licensed technology  reported revenue during the relevant period would differ 
as of december    was recorded as deferred revenue  of which  is creditable against future commercial license agreements that have not yet been executed or deemed effective 
for the years ended december  and   and  respectively  of revenue was recognized relating to cash payments received that were creditable against license fees and or royalties for which we determined there was no appreciable likelihood of executing a license agreement with the customer 
for the year ended december   no such revenue was recognized 
for arrangements with extended payment terms where the fee is not fixed and determinable  revenue is recognized when the payment is due and payable 
valuation of stock based compensation we recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of equity based compensation issued to employees and directors see notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also record an expense for equity based compensation grants to non employees  in exchange for goods or services  and stock appreciation rights sars issued to employees  based on the fair value  which is remeasured over the vesting period of such awards 

table of contents we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of sars  options and warrants we have granted for purposes of recording charges to the statement of operations 
in order to calculate the fair value of the sars  options and warrants  assumptions are made for certain components of the model  including expected volatility  expected dividend yield rate and expected life 
expected volatilities utilized in the model are based on the historical volatility of our stock price over a period commensurate with the expected life of the stock option 
the risk free interest rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
in the case of stock options granted to employees  we estimate the expected term of options granted based on our historical experience with our employees exercise of stock options 
in the case of stock options and warrants granted to non employees  the contractual life is used 
although we use our best estimates when setting these assumptions  changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to the valuation of future grants or the remeasurement of non employee awards 
accounting for warrants on january   we adopted certain revised provisions of accounting standards codification asc  derivatives and hedging 
these provisions apply to freestanding financial instruments or embedded features that have the characteristics of a derivative and to freestanding financial instruments that are potentially settled in an entity s own common stock 
as a result  certain stock purchase warrants that we issued  but which are no longer outstanding  were considered to be derivatives since they contained down round provisions requiring remeasurement at fair value at the end of each period as they were recorded as liabilities 
due to the exercise of all remaining stock purchase warrants in  the stock warrant liability was at december  the fair value of the stock warrant liability was determined using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions for certain components of the model  including expected volatility and expected annual dividend yield 
expected volatilities utilized in the model were based on the historical volatility of our stock price over a period commensurate with the remaining contractual life of the warrant 
the risk free interest rate was derived from the us treasury yield curve 
the term of the warrants was based on the remaining contractual life 
although we used our best estimates when setting these assumptions  changes in assumptions could have caused significant adjustments to the valuation of the stock warrant liability 
the change in fair value of the stock warrant liability was recorded as a gain or loss on the statement of operations  until all warrants were exercised 
retirement plan we have recorded a significant retirement plan benefit liability that is developed from actuarial valuations 
the determination of our retirement plan benefit liability requires key assumptions regarding discount rates  as well as rates of compensation increases  retirement dates and life expectancies used to determine the present value of future benefit payments 
we determine these assumptions in consultation with  and after input from  our actuaries and considering our experience and expectations for the future 
actual results for a given period will often differ from assumed amounts because of economic and other factors 
the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which the benefit liabilities could be settled at the end of the year 
the discount rate is determined by selecting a single rate that produces a result equivalent to discounting expected benefit payments from the plan using the citigroup above median pension discount curve curve 
based upon this analysis using the curve  we used a discount rate to measure our retirement plan benefit liability of at december  a change of basis points in the discount rate would increase or decrease the expense on an annual basis by approximately  results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had operating income of  for the year ended december   compared to an operating loss of  for the change to operating income was due to an increase in revenue of  offset by an increase in operating expenses of  we had net income of  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share for the change to net income was primarily due to 
table of contents an increase of operating income of  a decrease in loss on stock warrant liability of  an increase in interest income of  and an increase in income tax benefit of  our revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in our overall revenue was primarily due to additional oled material sales and licensing revenues from the expanded adoption of our technology and materials in the marketplace by display manufacturers  particularly smd 
material sales increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for material sales relates to the sale of our oled materials for incorporation into our customers commercial oled products or for their oled development and evaluation activities 
material sales included sales of both phosphorescent emitter and host materials 
phosphorescent emitter sales were of our total material sales in  compared to of our total material sales in host material sales were of our total material sales in  compared to of our total material sales in we believe we can participate in the host material business due to our long experience developing emitter materials  which are used together with host material in the emissive layer of an oled 
however  our customers are not required to purchase our host materials in order to utilize our phosphorescent emitter materials  and in addition the host material business is more competitive than the phosphorescent emitter material sales business 
thus  our long term prospects for host material sales are uncertain 
we cannot accurately predict how long our phosphorescent emitter material sales or host material sales to particular customers will continue  as our customers frequently update and alter their product offerings in response to market demands 
continued sales of our oled materials to these customers will depend on several factors  including pricing  availability  continued technical improvement and competitive product offerings 
royalty and license fees increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for a substantial portion of the increase was due to royalty and license fee payments received under our patent license agreements with smd  including our new agreement with smd executed in august this new agreement superseded our prior patent license agreement with smd  which was entered into in at the same time  we entered into a supplemental material purchase agreement with smd 
both new agreements have terms that run through december  based upon the arrangement containing payment terms over the course of the agreement  such amounts are not considered fixed and determinable for revenue recognition purposes 
as a result  the recognition of license fees under our new agreement with smd is based on receipt of payment  therefore our quarterly license fees will fluctuate accordingly  depending on the timing of such payments 
our new patent license agreement with smd covers the manufacture and sale of specified oled display products 
under the agreement  smd has agreed to pay us a fixed license fee  payable in installments over the agreement term 
these installments increase on an annual basis over the term of the license agreement 
the installment amounts were determined through negotiation based on a number of factors  including  without limitation  estimates of smd s oled business growth as a percentage of published oled market forecasts  the use of red and green phosphorescent materials in smd s oled display products  and appropriate royalty rates relating to smd s practice under the licensed patents 
for the year ended december   we received and recognized  in license fees from smd under the new patent license agreement and  in royalties from smd under the old patent license agreement 
pursuant to the new supplemental agreement  smd agreed to purchase from us a minimum dollar amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products 
this minimum purchase commitment is subject to smd s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement 
the minimum purchase amounts increase on an annual basis over the term of the supplemental agreement 
these amounts were determined through negotiation based on a number of factors  including  without limitation  estimates of smd s oled business growth as a percentage of published oled market forecasts and smd s projected minimum usage of red and green phosphorescent emitter materials over the term of the agreement 
smd purchased phosphorescent emitter materials from us in excess of the minimum purchase amount for the year ended december  
table of contents cost of material sales increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for  based on the aforementioned increase in material sales 
cost of material sales includes the cost of producing materials that have been classified as commercial and shipping costs for such materials  but excludes the cost of producing certain materials which costs have already been expensed as research and development expense 
commercial materials are materials that have been validated by the company for use in commercial oled products 
depending on the amounts  timing and stage of materials being classified as commercial  we expect the costs of materials sold to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
as a result of these timing issues  and due to increased sales of commercial materials  cost of material sales increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in for the years ended december  and  costs associated with  and  respectively  of material sales relating to commercial materials were included in cost of material sales 
we incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the increase was mainly due to increased employee costs of  due primarily to new employees  increased salaries  costs associated with retirement benefits and incentive stock awards for certain executive officers  increased costs of  due to overall expanded research and development efforts to support the growth of our business  and costs of  resulting from commencement of research and development activities at certain of our foreign subsidiaries  offset by decreased amortization costs of  due to part of our acquired technology being fully amortized as of december  selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the overall increase in these costs was driven in part by increased commercial activities and non cash expenses related to stock compensation and in part by costs incurred to establish new subsidiaries in hong kong  korea and japan 
specifically  we incurred increased costs in the following areas increased employee costs of  due primarily to increased salaries  costs associated with retirement benefits and incentive stock awards for certain executive officers  costs of  resulting from the incorporation and commencement of operations of certain of our foreign subsidiaries  increased costs of  related to stock compensation for members of our board of directors  increased legal fees of  due in large part to expanded licensing negotiations  increased expense of  due to costs associated with certain prototypes  and increased international consulting fees of  resulting from increased revenues 
patent costs increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the increase was mainly due to increased costs associated with our defense of certain ongoing and new challenges to our issued patents  as well as the timing of prosecution and maintenance costs associated with a number of patents and patent applications 
royalty and license expense increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the increase consisted mainly of royalties incurred under an amended license agreement with princeton  usc and michigan  resulting from increased revenues 
see note in noted to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the increase was mainly attributable to interest earned on higher average cash and investment balances as a result of proceeds received from the completion of our public offering in march in  all remaining outstanding stock warrants to purchase shares of our common stock were exercised 
the warrants  which contained a down round provision  were previously recorded as a liability 
the change in fair value of 
table of contents these warrants during the period prior to the exercise date resulted in a  non cash loss on our statement of operations for the year ended december   compared to a  non cash loss for during the year ended december   we sold approximately million of our state related income tax net operating losses nols and  of our research and development tax credits under the new jersey technology tax certificate transfer program 
we recorded the amount of the completed sale as an income tax benefit for the year ended december  and received the proceeds of  in january during the year ended december   we sold approximately million of our state related income tax nols and  of our research and development tax credits under the new jersey technology tax certificate transfer program 
we received proceeds of  from our sale of these nols and research and development tax credits  and we recorded these proceeds as an income tax benefit for the year ended december  the above mentioned income tax benefit was offset by foreign income tax withholdings in connection with payments received from smd 
we had previously filed for and were granted a five year exemption from withholding tax on royalties and license fees received from smd under our patent license agreement as part of a tax incentive program in korea 
the exemption remained in effect until may since then  smd has been required to withhold tax upon payment of royalties to us 
this is also the case under our new patent license agreement with smd  which we entered into in august in and  the withholding tax rate for royalties and license fees paid by smd was 
for the years ended december  and  foreign income taxes of  and  respectively  were withheld in connection with these payments 
we anticipate the amount of withholding taxes to increase as associated payments received from smd increase in the future 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had an operating loss of  for the year ended december   compared to an operating loss of  for the decrease in operating loss was due to an increase in revenue of  offset by an increase in operating expenses of  we had a net loss of  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share  for the decrease in net loss was primarily due to a decrease in operating loss of  offset by an increase in loss on stock warrant liability of  our revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for material sales increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for material sales relates to the sale of our oled materials for incorporation into our customers commercial oled products or for their oled development and evaluation activities 
material sales included sales of both phosphorescent emitter and host materials 
phosphorescent emitter sales were of our total material sales in  compared to of our total material sales in host material sales were of our total material sales in  compared to of our total material sales in we cannot accurately predict how long our phosphorescent emitter material sales or host material sales to particular customers will continue  as our customers frequently update and alter their product offerings in response to market demands 
continued sales of our oled materials to these customers will depend on several factors  including pricing  availability  continued technical improvement and competitive product offerings 
royalty and license fees increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for a substantial portion of the increase was due to additional royalty payments received under our patent license agreement with smd 
as previously discussed  the patent license agreement was superseded by a new patent license agreement we entered into with smd in august we filed for and were granted a five year exemption on withholding tax on royalty payments received from smd under our patent license agreement as part of a tax incentive program in korea 
the exemption was granted in may 
table of contents and remained in effect until may since then  smd has been required to withhold tax upon payment of royalties to us 
in  the withholding tax rate for royalty payments made by smd was 
cost of material sales increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   based on the aforementioned increase in material sales 
we incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the increase in research and development expenses was consistent with our expectations based on the growth of our business 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was mainly due to increased employee costs of  due primarily to increased salaries and stock compensation for certain executive officers  and expenses of  related to net periodic benefit costs of the universal display corporation supplemental executive retirement plan serp for certain executive officers  which was implemented in see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
patent costs increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the increase was mainly due to the timing of prosecution and maintenance costs associated with a number of patents and patent applications  as well as the timing of costs for certain ongoing and new patent matters 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the decrease was mainly attributable to decreased rates of return on investments during  compared to rates of return during at december   we had outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  which warrants contained a down round provision requiring liability classification 
the change in fair value of these warrants during the period resulted in a  non cash loss on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  compared to a  non cash loss for the year ended december  the warrants continued to be reported as a liability  with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of operations  until these warrants were exercised in during the year ended december   we sold approximately million of our state related income tax net operating losses nols and  of our research and development tax credits under the new jersey technology tax certificate transfer program 
we received proceeds of  from our sale of these nols and research and development tax credits  and we recorded these proceeds as an income tax benefit 
in past years  we completed our sales of state related tax nols during the fourth quarter of the year 
the income tax benefit was offset by foreign income taxes of  withheld in connection with our royalty revenues  as noted above 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and short term investments of  for a total of  this compares to cash and cash equivalents of  and short term investments of  for a total of  as of december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of  was primarily due to the completion in march of our public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the offering resulted in net proceeds to us of  cash provided by operating activities was  for  compared to cash used in operating activities of  for the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the following a decrease in net loss of  which amount excludes the impact of non cash items  the impact of the timing of payment of accounts payable and accrued expenses of  the impact of the timing of receipt of accounts receivable of  a decrease in other current assets of  and an increase of  in deferred revenue and licensing fees received  offset by 
table of contents an increase in inventory of  cash used in investing activities was  for  compared to  for the increase in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to increased purchases of short term investments as a result of the completion of our public offering in march  as well as purchases of property and equipment of cash provided by financing activities was  for  compared to  for the increase in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to the completion of our march public offering 
the offering resulted in proceeds to us of  which was net of  in underwriting discounts and commissions and other costs associated with the completion of the offering 
in addition  for the year ended december   we received proceeds of  from the exercise of options and warrants to purchase shares of our common  compared to proceeds of  from the exercise of options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in in connection with stock based employee compensation and option exercises for the years ended december  and  we made payments of  and  respectively  in withholding taxes 
working capital was  as of december   compared to  which included a stock warrant liability of  as of december  the stock warrants associated with this liability were all exercised in  resulting in no cash outlay by us 
working capital  excluding the stock warrant liability  was  as of december  the increase in working capital was primarily due to proceeds from the completion of our public offering in march we anticipate  based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations including  among others  assumptions regarding our working capital requirements  the progress of our research and development efforts  the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work  and the timing and costs associated with the preparation  filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications  that we have sufficient cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next months 
we believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long term and short term borrowings  public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of outstanding stock options 
it should be noted  however  that additional funding may be required in the future for research  development and commercialization of our oled technologies and materials  to obtain  maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials  and for working capital and other purposes  the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed  on commercially reasonable terms or at all  particularly in the current economic environment 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years estimated retirement plan benefit payments sponsored research obligation minimum royalty obligation  year total under the license agreement  we are obligated to pay princeton minimum royalties of  per year until such time as the agreement is no longer in effect 
the agreement has no scheduled expiration date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of obligations upon termination of employment of executive officers as a result of a change in control of the company 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or similar arrangements serving as credit  liquidity or

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our short term investments disclosed in fair value measurements in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
we invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments 
our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates  which would impact interest income earned on investments 
however  based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience  we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income 
substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of north america 
all revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk
