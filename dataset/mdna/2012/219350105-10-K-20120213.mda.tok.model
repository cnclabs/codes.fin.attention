item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations organization of information management s discussion and analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion includes the following sections overview results of operations reportable segments liquidity and capital resources environment critical accounting estimates new accounting standards forward looking statements overview although corning s net income declined in when compared to  the majority of our segments experienced healthy sales growth  despite the challenging economic environment 
the largest driver of corning s sales increase was the robust retail demand for portable display devices that utilize our corning gorilla glass 
our telecommunications segment also experienced significant sales growth in due to strong fiber to the premises  enterprise network products  and optical fiber and cable sales 
in addition  sales increased in in our environmental technologies segment  reflecting increased demand worldwide for automotive and diesel products 
sales in the life sciences segment were higher primarily due to an increase in demand for the segment s legacy products  combined with the impact of a small acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of sales in our display technologies segment were only slightly higher in when compared to the prior year  reflecting volume growth and favorable movements in foreign exchange rates  offset by significantly lower prices 
results in this segment reflect the excess glass capacity in the market  driven by lower than anticipated worldwide glass volume growth in corning is addressing the current imbalance between glass supply and demand by reducing worldwide glass capacity in our display technologies and specialty materials segments by approximately  impacting lcd glass capacity as well as corning gorilla glass capacity 
for the year ended december   we generated net income of billion or per share compared to net income of billion or per share for when compared to last year  the decrease in net income was due largely to the following items lower net income in the display technologies segment due to a significant decrease in equity earnings from our equity affiliate samsung corning precision  reflecting higher taxes  lower volume and substantial price declines  combined with a decrease in net income in our wholly owned business  driven by price declines  a decrease in equity earnings from our equity affiliate dow corning  primarily due to significantly higher raw materials costs  the absence of non recurring favorable tax items recorded in and a sales shift from higher priced  higher margin silicones to lower priced  lower margin silicones 
the decrease in equity earnings was offset somewhat by an million gain associated with the resolution of a contract dispute by hemlock semiconductor group against one of its customers relating to enforcement of long term supply agreements 
hemlock semiconductor group is dow corning s consolidated subsidiary that makes high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries  the absence of the benefit of the settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims in impacting our display technologies segment in the amount of million pre tax  a million impairment charge pretax impacting our specialty materials segment related to certain assets located in japan used in the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass  and an increase in our effective tax rate due to the following the absence of the favorable tax impact from the decision to repatriate earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries in in the amount of million  and the expiration of tax holidays in taiwan 
the decrease in net income in was offset somewhat from the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates in the amount of million  and higher net income in our telecommunications and environmental technologies segments 
corning remains committed to a strategy of growing through global innovation while preserving our independence 
this strategy has served us well 
our key priorities for were similar to those in prior years protect our financial health and invest in the future 
during  we made the following progress on these priorities financial health our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities 
significant items in included the following our debt to capital ratio at december  was  slightly lower than our debt to capital ratio of at december  operating cash flow for the year was billion 
we ended the year with over billion of cash and short term investments 
corning s board of directors declared a increase in the company s quarterly common stock dividend 
we repurchased million shares of common stock for million as part of a repurchase program announced in the fourth quarter 
these actions reflect our significant cash balance and the belief that we will continue to achieve strong cash flows in the future 
investing in our future we continue to focus on the future and on what we do best creating keystone components that enable high technology systems 
we remain committed to investing in research  development and engineering to drive innovation 
we continue to work on new products  including glass substrates for high performance displays  oled and lcd applications  diesel filters and substrates  and the optical fiber  cable and hardware and equipment that enable fiber to the premises  and next generation data centers 
in addition  in  we increased our focused on wireless solutions for diverse venue applications such as distributed antenna systems  fiber to the cell and antennas 
we have increased our research  development and engineering spending to support the advancement of new product attributes for our corning gorilla glass suite of products 
we will continue to focus on adjacent glass opportunities  including products such as glass substrates for thin film photovoltaics in solar applications  which leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes 
our research  development and engineering expenditures increased by million in when compared to  but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales 
we believe our spending levels are appropriate to support our technology and innovation strategies 
capital spending increased significantly in when compared to  largely as a result of several multi year investment plans announced in that will increase manufacturing capacity in several of our reportable segments 
specifically  the increase in spending in was driven by construction costs for an lcd glass substrate facility in china for our display technologies segment and a capacity expansion project for specialty materials corning gorilla glass in japan 
capital expenditures in also include spending in the environmental technologies segment to expand its existing automotive substrate facilities in shanghai  china and kaiserslautern  germany  and in the life sciences segment to establish a manufacturing and distribution facility in wujiang  china 
total capital expenditures for were billion 
in  approximately billion was invested in our display technologies segment and approximately million was invested in our specialty materials segment 
we expect our capital spending to be about billion 
approximately million will be allocated to our display technologies segment  of which approximately million will be related to capital projects 
corporate outlook corning expects moderate sales growth in  led by an increase in demand in our telecommunications and environmental technologies segments 
we believe worldwide demand for lcd glass in will increase from billion square feet to approximately billion square feet when compared to  driven by the combination of an increase in retail sales of lcd televisions and the demand for larger television screen sizes  coupled with growth in the personal computer market 
we expect cumulative double digit price declines in our display segment over the two quarter period beginning in the fourth quarter of we are hopeful that sequential quarterly price declines in will be moderate 
net income will be negatively impacted by lower equity earnings from our equity affiliate dow corning  driven by lower demand and price declines in both silicone products and at hemlock semiconductor group  dow corning s consolidated subsidiary that makes high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries 
we may take advantage of acquisition opportunities that support the long term strategies of our businesses 
we remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation  while preserving our financial stability  will enable our continued long term success

restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits corning recorded restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits in  and  which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented 
a description of those charges and credits follows activity in the fourth quarter of  corning recorded an impairment charge in the amount of million related to certain assets located in japan used in the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass 
large cover glass is primarily used as a cover sheet of strengthened glass for frameless bezel less lcd displays 
the large cover glass impairment charge represents a write down of assets specific to the glass strengthening process for large size cover glass to their relative fair market values as of the date of impairment 
this asset group includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process and facilities dedicated to the ion exchange process 
additional information on the asset impairment is found in note property  net of accumulated depreciation and note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements 
activity in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million in other credits as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims resulting from two events which impacted production at several of our lcd glass manufacturing facilities 
in august  an earthquake halted production at one of our lcd glass manufacturing facilities in japan and in october  production at our facility in taichung  taiwan was impacted by a power disruption 
activity in response to anticipated lower sales in  we recorded charges of million primarily for a corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce 
the charges included costs for severance  special termination benefits  outplacement services  and the impact of a million curtailment loss for postretirement benefits in total cash expenditures associated with these actions were approximately million  with the majority of spending for employee related costs completed by and payments for exit activities substantially completed by the end of annualized savings from these actions are about million and are reflected largely in cost of sales and selling  general  and administrative expenses 
asbestos litigation in  we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of million compared to a net decrease in of million 
the net decrease in was due primarily to a million decrease to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation that was recorded in the first quarter of  as a result of the change in terms of the proposed settlement of the pcc asbestos claims 
for the remainder of  we recorded net credit adjustments to our asbestos litigation liability of million to reflect the change in value of the estimated settlement liability 
in  we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of million 
our asbestos litigation liability was estimated to be million at december   compared with an estimate of million at december  the entire obligation is classified as a non current liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than months after the proposed amended pcc plan is ultimately effective  and a portion of the obligation fulfilled through the direct contribution of corning s investment in pce currently recorded as a non current other equity method investment

equity in earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments in millions years ended december  samsung corning precision dow corning all other total equity earnings equity earnings of affiliated companies decreased in  reflecting lower earnings performance at both samsung corning precision and at dow corning  when compared to last year 
the change in equity earnings from samsung corning precision is explained more fully in the discussion of the performance of the display technologies segment and in all other 
equity earnings from dow corning were lower in when compared to the decline in equity earnings was largely due to the following items an increase in raw material costs of slightly above million  a sales shift from higher priced  higher margin silicones to lower priced  lower margin silicones  and a decrease in advanced energy manufacturing tax credits 
the decrease in equity earnings from dow corning was partially offset by a gain in the amount of million associated with the resolution of a contract dispute by dow corning s consolidated subsidiary  hemlock semiconductor group hemlock  a producer of high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries  against one of its customers relating to enforcement of long term supply agreements 
in the second half of  dow corning began experiencing unfavorable industry conditions at hemlock 
declines in governmental subsidies in the solar panel industry  especially in europe  and over capacity at all levels of the solar supply chain led to significant declines in polycrystalline spot prices 
the decline in spot prices was large enough to potentially induce hemlock customers to default on their long term contracts 
in response  hemlock modified a number of sales agreements to provide temporary pricing relief while preserving the long term favorable relationships with its customers 
in addition  hemlock decided to delay certain plant expansion activities until market conditions for polycrystalline silicon have improved 
prices for polycrystalline silicon are expected to remain at these substantially lower levels throughout  negatively impacting profitability at hemlock and resulting in lower equity earnings from dow corning in when compared to the increase in equity earnings from dow corning in when compared to was primarily due to the following items an increase in sales of  resulting from strength in dow corning s traditional silicone products and improved volume at hemlock  the positive impact of advanced energy manufacturing tax credits approved by the us government for dow corning s manufacturing expansion projects that support the solar industry 
corning s share of these credits was million  the release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets 
the impact to corning was million  and the absence of restructuring charges in the amount of million recorded in for our share of costs associated with dow corning s global workforce reduction 
other income expense  net other income expense  net in corning s consolidated statements of income includes the following in millions years ended december  royalty income from samsung corning precision foreign currency transaction and hedge losses  net loss on retirement of debt net realized losses of available for sale securities net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests other  net total income before income taxes in addition to the items identified under gross margin  restructuring  impairment and other charges credits  asbestos litigation charge credit  and other income  net  movements in foreign exchange rates also impacted results for the years presented 
in  income before income taxes included million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to in  income before income taxes included million for the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the previous year 
provision benefit for income taxes our provision benefit for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows in millions years ended december  provision benefit for income taxes effective tax rate the effective income tax rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items rate differences on income losses of consolidated foreign companies  the impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies  the benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in foreign jurisdictions  and a million tax benefit from amending our us federal return to claim foreign tax credits 
the effective income tax rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items rate differences on income losses of consolidated foreign companies  the impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies  the benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in foreign jurisdictions  the benefit of excess foreign tax credits from repatriation of current year earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries  and the impact of the reversal of the deferred tax assets associated with a tax exempt subsidy attributable to our other postretirement benefits liability 
the effective income tax rate benefit for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items rate differences on income losses of consolidated foreign companies  the impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies  the benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in foreign jurisdictions  the benefit of the us research and experimentation tax credit for years  the benefit of recording additional deferred tax assets for a tax exempt subsidy attributable to our opeb liability  and the impact of the net increase in valuation allowances due to changes in judgment on the realizability of certain state and foreign deferred tax assets 
corning has valuation allowances on certain shorter lived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards  as well as other foreign net operating loss carry forwards and federal and state tax credits  because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire 
us profits of approximately billion will be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of december  of that amount  billion of us profits will be required over the next years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss carry forwards 
the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized as the underlying temporary differences reverse over an extended period 
the amount of us and foreign deferred tax assets that had valuation allowances at december  and was million and million  respectively 
we currently provide income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted 
as of december   taxes have not been provided on approximately billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely 
it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings 
certain foreign subsidiaries in china and taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements 
the nature and extent of such arrangements vary  and the benefits of such arrangements phase out through according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions 
the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of  and percentage points for  and  respectively 
while we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next months  we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position 
refer to note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters 
net income attributable to corning incorporated as a result of the items discussed above  net income and per share data was as follows in millions  except per share amounts years ended december  net income attributable to corning incorporated basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share shares used in computing per share amounts basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share reportable segments our reportable segments are as follows display technologies manufactures glass substrates for flat panel liquid crystal displays 
telecommunications manufactures optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment components for the telecommunications industry 
environmental technologies manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel applications 
this reportable segment is an aggregation of our automotive and diesel operating segments as these two segments share similar economic characteristics  products  customer types  production processes and distribution methods 
specialty materials manufactures products that provide more than material formulations for glass  glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs 
life sciences manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications 
all other reportable segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as all other 
this group is primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines 
we prepared the financial results for our segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions 
we included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment s net income 
we have allocated certain common expenses among our reportable segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information 
segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies 
the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we began providing us income tax expense or benefit on us earnings losses due to the change in our conclusion about the realizability of our us deferred tax assets in as a result of the change in our tax position  we adjusted the allocation of taxes to our reportable segments in to reflect this difference 
the impact of changing our allocation methodology was not significant

the end market for lcd televisions was up slightly  with unit growth rates remaining consistent with or exceeding our expectations across all geographic regions 
additionally  larger sized lcd televisions were the fastest growing size category in and have resulted in area growth rates that were even higher than unit growth rates 
however  because corning sells to panel makers and not to end market consumers  supply chain expansion and contraction for this industry are key factors in corning s sales volume 
while end market demand continues to grow in all lcd applications  inventory levels within the lcd supply chain have not kept pace with this growth  and have  in fact  declined in absolute terms during when compared to  resulting in lower volume and excess capacity in the supply chain 
as a result  corning announced in the fourth quarter of that it would reduce capacity at our wholly owned business by delaying the start up of new glass melting tanks  as well as postponing the relight of tanks that were removed from service for normal repair 
our equity affiliate  samsung corning precision  took similar actions in the fourth quarter of the slight increase in net sales in the display technologies segment in  compared to  was driven primarily by the favorable impact of approximately million from movements in foreign exchange rates 
net sales of this segment are denominated in japanese yen and  as a result  are susceptible to movements in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate 
volume growth in was more than offset by price declines  when compared to when compared to  the decrease in equity earnings from samsung corning precision in reflected volume and price declines  offset somewhat by the favorable impact of approximately million from movements in foreign exchange rates 
equity earnings of samsung corning precision are impacted by movements in both the us dollar japanese yen and us dollar korean won exchange rates 
the impact of the supply chain contraction and excess capacity has been more severe in korea  resulting in higher price and volume declines at samsung corning precision than at our wholly owned business 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  although samsung corning precision significantly reduced its glass pricing in light of the current state of glass supply in the industry  it did not recover market share that was lost in the third quarter 
due to these market dynamics  samsung corning precision reduced its glass melting capacity  as described above 
equity earnings were also negatively impacted by higher taxes due to the partial expiration of a korean tax holiday and the absence of a million credit for our share of a revised tax holiday calculation agreed to by the korean national tax service recorded in when compared to  the decrease in net income in the display technologies segment in reflects the impact of lower equity earnings  price declines and a decrease in royalty income  partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiency and the favorable impact of approximately million from foreign exchange rate movements 
net income was also negatively impacted by the absence of a pre tax credit recorded in in the amount of million as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims 
a number of corning s patents and know how are licensed to samsung corning precision  as well as to third parties  which generates royalty income 
royalty income from samsung corning precision decreased in  when compared to  reflecting the decline in sales volume at samsung corning precision 
corning and samsung corning precision have agreed that  for a five year period commencing december   the applicable royalty rate will be reduced by approximately compared to the prior five years

equity earnings of samsung corning precision are impacted by movements in both the us dollar japanese yen and us dollar korean won exchange rates 
equity earnings were also positively impacted by a million credit for our share of a revised samsung corning precision tax holiday calculation agreed to by the korean national tax service 
when compared to  the increase in net income in primarily reflects the impact of the volume increases described above at both our wholly owned business and samsung corning precision and the impact of an insurance settlement for business interruption and property damage insurance claims  partially offset by price declines 
the insurance settlement relates to two events in which impacted production at our lcd glass manufacturing facilities 
in august  an earthquake halted production at one of our lcd glass manufacturing facilities in japan and  in october  production at our facility in taichung  taiwan was impacted by a power disruption 
we recorded a pre tax credit in in the amount of million as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims related to these two events 
results also improved due to the absence of million of restructuring charges impacting net income 
net income included royalty income from samsung corning precision that was higher in when compared to  reflecting the improvements in sales volume at samsung corning precision 
net income in also includes the favorable impact of million from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to other information the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan  china and taiwan 
in  four customers of the display technologies segment  which individually accounted for more than of segment net sales  accounted for a combined of total segment sales 
for and  three customers of the display technologies segment  which individually accounted for more than of segment net sales  accounted for and  respectively  of total segment sales when totaled 
our customers face the same global economic dynamics as we do in this market 
while we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues  our near term sales and profitability would be impacted if any of these significant customers were unable to continue to purchase our products 
in addition  samsung corning precision s sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers 
in  and  sales to two lcd panel makers located in korea accounted for approximately of samsung corning precision sales in each of those three years 
corning has invested heavily to expand capacity to meet the projected demand for lcd glass substrates 
in  and  capital spending in this segment was billion  million  and million  respectively 
we expect capital spending for to be approximately million  of which approximately million will be related to spending from capital projects 
in and  several of corning s customers entered into long term purchase and supply agreements in which corning s display technologies segment would supply large size glass substrates to these customers over periods of up to six years 
as part of the agreements  these customers agreed to advance cash deposits to corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased 
we received our last deposit of million in july and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements 
during  and  we issued million  million  and million  respectively  in credits that were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due 
as of december   no additional deposits have been received and all amounts previously owed as credits have been applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due 
refer to note other liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
outlook we expect the overall lcd glass retail market to increase from billion square feet in to approximately billion square feet in we believe that the long term market drivers will be lcd television growth  driven by growth of larger sized lcd televisions and increased demand in emerging regions  as well as continued growth in the personal computer market 
in the first quarter of  we expect volume at our wholly owned business to be consistent with the fourth quarter of we anticipate volume at samsung corning precision to be flat to down in the double digits  depending upon the outcome of negotiations with a key customer  when compared to the fourth quarter of we expect cumulative double digit price declines over the two quarter period beginning in the fourth quarter of the end market demand for lcd televisions  monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending  among other things 
we are cautious about the potential negative impacts that economic conditions  particularly a global economic recession  excess market capacity and world political tensions could have on consumer demand 
while the industry has grown rapidly in recent years  economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes  prices  or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth 
therefore  it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time 
we may incur further charges in this segment to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity 
in addition  changes in foreign exchange rates  principally the japanese yen  will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment

sales of fiber to the premises products increased  driven by initiatives in canada  europe and australia 
optical fiber and cable sales growth reflected record volume  moderating price declines and an increase in sales of premium products 
sales also increased due to a small acquisition completed in the first quarter of and the positive impact from movements in foreign exchange rates in the amount of million 
the increase in net income in when compared to reflects higher volume across all product lines and an increase in sales of higher margin products  coupled with a credit in the amount of million for the decrease in a contingent liability associated with a first quarter acquisition 
the increase in net income was offset slightly by the impact of higher raw materials and project costs associated with our initiatives in australia and europe

net sales automotive diesel total net sales net income loss the percentage change calculation is not meaningful 
vs 
when compared to  net sales in the environmental technologies segment increased in  primarily due to higher sales of diesel products 
the increase was driven by an increase in truck production in the united states  implementation of european governmental regulations on light duty diesel vehicles  and the first stages of the implementation of off road vehicle regulations in the united states 
sales of our automotive products also increased slightly in  when compared to  reflecting the continuing growth of worldwide automotive production 
net sales of this segment in were positively impacted by million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to net income in increased  when compared to  due to higher sales volume for our diesel products  combined with reduced air freight expense and improved manufacturing performance in both diesel and automotive product lines 
the increase in net income was slightly offset by higher depreciation and project costs on manufacturing capacity expansion 
movements in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted the results of this segment in the amount of million when compared to the environmental technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of catalyzer and emission control systems manufacturers  who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers

off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements are transactions  agreements  or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
corning s off balance sheet arrangements include the following guarantee contracts  and variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities 
at the time a guarantee is issued  the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes 
in the normal course of our business  we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees 
generally  third party guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees  including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds  and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones 
these guarantees have various terms  and none of these guarantees are individually significant 
refer to note commitments  contingencies  and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
for variable interest entities  we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  which are the ownership  contractual  or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity s net assets excluding variable interests 
corning has identified four entities that qualify as variable interest entities 
none of these entities is considered to be significant to corning s consolidated statements of position 
corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity 
contractual obligations the amounts of our obligations follow in millions amount of commitment and contingency expiration per period total less than year to years to years to years years and thereafter performance bonds and guarantees credit facilities for equity companies stand by letters of credit subtotal of commitment expirations per period purchase obligations capital expenditure obligations total debt interest on long term debt minimum rental commitments capital leases imputed interest on capital leases uncertain tax positions subtotal of contractual obligation payments due by period total commitments and contingencies at december   million of the million was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
capital expenditure obligations primarily reflect amounts associated with our capital expansion activities 
at december   billion was included on our balance sheet 
total debt above is stated at maturity value 
the estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity or expiration of the related debt  based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments 
at december   million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions 
of this amount  we are unable to estimate when million of that amount will become payable 
we are required  at the time a guarantee is issued  to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes 
in the normal course of our business  we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees 
generally  third party guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees  including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds  and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones 
these guarantees have various terms  and none of these guarantees are individually significant 
we have agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow corning 
the funding of the dow corning credit facility will be required only if dow corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed bankruptcy plan 
the purchase obligations primarily represent raw material and energy related take or pay contracts 
we believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 
environment corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act  or by state governments under similar state laws  as a potentially responsible party for active hazardous waste sites 
under the superfund act  all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site  identified by the agency  are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise 
it is corning s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants 
at december  and  corning had accrued approximately million undiscounted and million undiscounted  respectively  for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation 
based upon the information developed to date  management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates that required us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates  follow 
impairment of assets held for use we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified 
we review our long lived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals  primarily platinum and rhodium 
these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life 
precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long lived assets 
this review considers all of the company s precious metals that are either in place in the production process  in reclamation  fabrication  or refinement in anticipation of re use  or awaiting use to support increased capacity 
precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other non manufacturing related purposes 
examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
for the majority of our reportable segments  we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
for long lived assets  when impairment indicators are present  we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows  including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value  to the assets carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable 
this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used 
assessments also consider changes in asset utilization  including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production 
if there is an impairment  a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets fair value and carrying value 
this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 
for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above  the estimated fair value of long lived assets is determined using an income approach  market approach  cost approach  or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed 
all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long lived assets  and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals if appropriate for the asset group being reviewed 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions in our analysis include market size and growth  market share  projected selling prices  manufacturing cost and discount rate 
our estimates are based upon our historical experience  our commercial relationships  and available external information about future trends 
we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions 
the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
in the event the current net book value of an asset group is found to be greater than the net present value of the cash flows derived from the asset group  we determine the actual fair market value of long lived assets with the assistance from valuation appraisals conducted by third parties 
the results of these valuations generally represent the fair market value of the asset group that will remain after any necessary impairment adjustments have been recorded 
the impairment charge will be allocated to assets within the asset group on a relative fair value basis 
at december   the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by million 
at december   the fair market value of precious metals was higher than our carrying value by million 
for the current reporting period  the undiscounted cash flow test shows that these precious metal assets  primarily in the display technologies segment  are recoverable as part of their asset groupings 
the potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of our segments 
such events include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our display technologies or specialty materials segments 
during the fourth quarter of  the specialty materials segment recorded a million impairment charge related to certain assets located in japan used in the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass 
large cover glass is primarily used as a cover sheet of strengthened glass for frameless bezel less lcd displays 
the large cover glass impairment charge represents a write down of assets specific to the glass strengthening process for large size cover glass to their relative fair market values as of the date of impairment 
this asset group includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process and facilities dedicated to the ion exchange process 
for the year ended december   we did not identify any instances where the carrying values of our long lived assets were not recoverable 
impairment of goodwill we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred  including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
corning s goodwill relates primarily to the telecommunications  specialty materials and life sciences operating segments 
our annual goodwill recoverability assessment has historically been performed in the fourth quarter  as it is traditionally based on our annual strategic planning process 
this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long term growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows 
our valuation method is an income approach using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods  plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon  are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return 
our estimates are based upon our historical experience  our current knowledge from our commercial relationships  and available external information about future trends 
our latest detailed assessment was completed in the fourth quarter of  and because we met the required criteria  was carried forward in in the fourth quarter of  we early adopted the guidance found in accounting standards update no 
 which simplifies how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
it provides an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the following summarizes our process to assess our goodwill balances for impairment on a quarterly basis  we assess qualitative factors in each of our reporting units which carry goodwill to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
the impairment test is required only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the following events and circumstances will be considered when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount macroeconomic conditions  such as a deterioration in general economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and or other developments in equity and credit markets  market capital in relation to book value  industry and market considerations  such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates  material loss in market share and significant declines in product pricing  cost factors  such as an increase in raw materials  labor or other costs  overall financial performance  such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or forecasted revenue  other relevant entity specific events  such as material changes in management or key personnel  and events affecting a reporting unit  such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets including acquisitions and dispositions 
the examples noted above are not all inclusive  and the company shall consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
we anticipate performing a detailed goodwill recoverability test in the second half of and every three years thereafter  unless indicators suggest otherwise 
telecommunications goodwill for the telecommunications segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test for this reporting unit  which was evaluated in the fourth quarter of the results of our impairment tests in and the update in indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount 
a discount rate of was used in we determined a range of discount rates between and would not have affected our conclusion 
in evaluating goodwill recoverability in the telecommunications segment in the fourth quarter of  we assessed qualitative factors in this reporting unit to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
based on our qualitative assessment  including but not limited to  consideration of the above factors  we concluded that it is more likely than not that there has not been a significant decrease in the amount that fair value exceeds the carrying value of goodwill in the telecommunications reporting unit 
specialty materials goodwill for the specialty materials segment is tested at the reporting unit level  which is one level below an operating segment  as goodwill is the result of transactions associated with certain businesses within this operating segment 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test for this reporting unit  which was evaluated in the fourth quarter of the results of our impairment tests in and the update in indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount 
a discount rate of was used in we determined a range of discount rates between and would not have affected our conclusion

based on our qualitative assessment  including but not limited to  consideration of the above factors  we concluded that it is more likely than not that there has not been a significant decrease in the amount that fair value exceeds the carrying value of goodwill in the specialty materials reporting unit 
additionally  the large cover glass impairment incurred in the fourth quarter of did not cause a triggering event for goodwill impairment in this reporting unit because the cash flow related to this lower level asset group is not material to this reporting unit 
life sciences goodwill for the life sciences segment is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test for this reporting unit  which was evaluated in the fourth quarter of the results of our impairment tests in and the update in indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount

as a result of the assessment of the qualitative factors  we have determined it is not necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test on our reporting units 
restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions we are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized 
we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including  for example  employee termination costs 
restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses  of portions thereof  their profitability  cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome 
the judgment involved can be difficult  subjective and complex in a number of areas  including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 
restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which  as a result  require impairment 
we are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 
income taxes we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies 
these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results  the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies  and the economic environments in which we do business 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 
significant estimates and assumptions used in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets included the long term stabilization of us income from forecasted royalty income in our display technologies operating segment  the long term growth of our diesel business  and the future success of new products 
equity method investments at december  and  the carrying value of our equity method investments was billion and billion  respectively  with our two largest equity method investments comprising approximately of the balance 
we review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if an event or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be other than temporarily impaired 
when such indicators are present  we then perform an in depth review for impairment 
an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability  forecasted tax rates  foreign currency exchange rate movements  terminal value assumptions  historical experience  our current knowledge from our commercial relationships  and available external information about future trends 
as of december  and  we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable 
fair value measures as required  corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable 
observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources  while unobservable inputs are based on the company s own market assumptions 
once inputs have been characterized  we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels 
characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement 
in addition  observable market data must be used when available and the highest and best use measure should be applied to non financial assets 
corning s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short term and long term investments  certain pension asset investments and derivatives 
these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions 
derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities 
in arriving at the fair value of corning s derivative assets and liabilities  we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria  including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction 
amounts related to credit risk are not material 
the level assets measured with unobservable inputs relate to certain pension asset investments and all long lived assets fair valued on a nonrecurring basis related to the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass  resulting in an impairment charge of million  which was included in earnings for the period 
refer to note fair value measurements of the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
probability of litigation outcomes we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter  case law  and other case specific issues 
see part ii item legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face 
the most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation 
there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability  including the inherent complexity of a chapter filing  our history of success in defending asbestos claims  our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses  and our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives 
the proposed asbestos resolution amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies 
the approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is not certain and faces objections by some parties 
any approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is subject to appeal 
for these and other reasons  corning s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters 
the estimate of the cost of resolving the non pcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur 
management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning s financial statements is remote 
other possible liabilities we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters  including certain tax planning and environmental matters  these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 
pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb pension and opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  interest cost  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning s employee pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was  million 
the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans change in assumption effect on pre tax pension expense effect on december  pbo basis point decrease in discount rate million million basis point increase in discount rate million million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million basis point increase in expected return on assets million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning s funding requirements 
in addition  at december   a basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by million before tax  and a basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders equity by million 
in addition  the impact of greater than a basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first basis point decrease in the discount rate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning s us opeb plans change in assumption effect on pre tax opeb expense effect on december  apbo basis point decrease in discount rate million million basis point increase in discount rate million million accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo 
the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
in certain instances  revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns  allowances  discounts  and other factors 
these estimates are supported by historical data 
while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning s future results 
share based compensation share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted 
new accounting standards refer to note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements the statements in this annual report on form k  in reports subsequently filed by corning with the securities and exchange commission sec on form q  form k  and related comments by management that are not historical facts or information and contain words such as believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  forecasts  and similar expressions are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual outcome to be materially different 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to global business  financial  economic and political conditions  tariffs and import duties  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and other currencies  primarily the japanese yen  new taiwan dollar  euro  and korean won  product demand and industry capacity  competitive products and pricing  availability and costs of critical components and materials  new product development and commercialization  order activity and demand from major customers  fluctuations in capital spending by customers  possible disruption in commercial activities due to terrorist activity  cyber attack  armed conflict  political or financial instability  natural disasters  or major health concerns  unanticipated disruption to equipment  facilities  or operations  facility expansions and new plant start up costs  effect of regulatory and legal developments  ability to pace capital spending to anticipated levels of customer demand  credit rating and ability to obtain financing and capital on commercially reasonable terms  adequacy and availability of insurance  financial risk management  acquisition and divestiture activities  rate of technology change  level of excess or obsolete inventory  ability to enforce patents and protect intellectual property and trade secrets  adverse litigation  product and components performance issues  retention of key personnel  stock price fluctuations  trends for the continued growth of the company s businesses  the ability of research and development projects to produce revenues in future periods  a downturn in demand or decline in growth rates for lcd glass substrates  customer ability  most notably in the display technologies segment  to maintain profitable operations and obtain financing to fund their ongoing operations and manufacturing expansions and pay their receivables when due  loss of significant customers  fluctuations in supply chain inventory levels  equity company activities  principally at dow corning corporation and samsung corning precision  changes in tax laws and regulations  changes in accounting rules and standards  the potential impact of legislation  government regulations  and other government action and investigations  temporary idling of capacity or delaying expansion  the ability to implement productivity  consolidation and cost reduction efforts  and to realize anticipated benefits  restructuring actions and charges  and other risks detailed in corning s sec filings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings  and exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar  which impact our net equity 
we have foreign currency exposure to many currencies including the japanese yen  euro  new taiwan dollar and korean won 
we selectively enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with durations generally months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases 
these hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to reduce the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
corning uses derivative instruments forwards to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities 
these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and  as such  are referred to as undesignated hedges 
changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges  along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities  are recorded in current period earnings in other income  net in the consolidated statements of income 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments  were billion and billion in and  respectively  with foreign based affiliates comprising over of this amount in equity earnings from samsung corning precision totaled billion for and billion for exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk 
market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   with respect to open forward contracts  and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements  a adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million compared to million at december  specific to the japanese yen  a adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million compared to million at december  specific to the euro  a adverse movement in quoted euro exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million compared to million at december  as we derive approximately of our net sales from outside the us  our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies  most notably the japanese yen and euro 
our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during remain constant at january levels 
as an example of impact changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our financial results  we compare actual sales in yen and euro transaction currencies at an average currency exchange rate during the year to a change in the currency exchange rate 
a plus or minus movement in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately million 
a plus or minus movement in the us dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately million 
using net income attributable to corning incorporated as a percentage of net sales of  we can estimate that a plus or minus movement in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately million 
a plus or minus movement in the us dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to net income attributable to corning incorporated of approximately million 
interest rate risk management it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
at december   our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than of variable rate instruments
