item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal were billion  a decrease of million  or when compared to fiscal engines segment net sales for fiscal were billion  which was lower by million or compared to fiscal this decrease in net sales was primarily driven by an reduction in shipment volumes of engines to oems for lawn and garden products in the north american and european markets due to drought conditions in north america and economic uncertainty in europe leading to reduced consumer purchases of lawn and garden equipment and unfavorable foreign exchange of million primarily related to the euro 
this was partially offset by increased engine pricing  a favorable mix of product shipped that reflected proportionally larger volumes of units used on snow throwers and portable and standby generators 
products segment net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million or from fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily due to increased shipments of portable and standby generators due to widespread power outages in the us as a result of landed hurricane irene and a subsequent snow storm on the united states east coast earlier in the fiscal year  increased shipments of snow equipment after channel inventories were depleted from the prior selling season  improved pricing  a favorable mix of lawn and garden sales through the dealer channel and favorable foreign exchange of million 
this increase was partially offset by reduced shipment volumes of riding lawn and garden equipment domestically and reduced volume in the international markets 
there were no landed hurricanes in fiscal gross profit the consolidated gross profit percentage was in fiscal  down from in the same period last year 
the engines segment gross profit percentage for fiscal was  which was lower compared to fiscal the gross profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by due to reduced absorption on a reduction in production volumes  from unfavorable foreign exchange  from higher manufacturing spending associated with rising commodity costs and start up costs of million associated with launching our phase iii emissions compliant engines  and due to million of restructuring charges 
this reduction was partially offset by a benefit due to improved engine pricing and a favorable mix of products sold 
the products segment gross profit percentage for fiscal was  which was higher compared to fiscal the gross profit percentage improved by from increased pricing and a favorable mix of lawn and garden sales through the dealer channel  due to production operational improvements of million and resulted from improved absorption on higher production volumes 
this was offset by a decrease of due to increased commodity costs and due to million of restructuring charges 
engineering  selling  general and administrative costs engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of million or from fiscal the engines segment engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal primarily due to lower employee compensation expense and a planned reduction of spend in advertising costs and professional services in response to the softness in the global markets 
the products segment engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal the increase was attributable to greater selling expense to support investments in international growth  higher employee compensation expense  and million higher bad debt expense recorded in fiscal primarily attributable to distributors in the european market 
restructuring actions in january  the company announced plans to reduce manufacturing capacity through closure of its newbern  tennessee and ostrava  czech republic plants as well as the reconfiguration of its plant in poplar bluff  missouri 
in april  the company announced plans to further reduce manufacturing costs through consolidation of its auburn  alabama manufacturing facility as well as the reduction of approximately of the company s salaried employees 
during fiscal  the company completed manufacturing operations at its newbern  tennessee and ostrava  czech republic plants  carried out the reconfiguration of the poplar bluff  missouri plant and implemented the salaried employee reductions 
pre tax costs of all restructuring actions totaled million in fiscal  of which million were included in gross profit as previously mentioned 
additionally  beginning in fiscal  as previously announced  the company will no longer pursue placement of lawn and garden products at national mass retailers 
the engines segment will continue to support lawn and garden equipment oems who provide lawn and garden equipment to these retailers 
the products segment will continue to focus on innovative  higher margin products that are sold through our network of simplicity  snapper and ferris dealers and regional retailers 
the company will also continue to sell pressure washers and portable and standby generators through the us mass retail channel 
interest expense for fiscal  interest expense was million lower compared to fiscal due to million of pre tax charges associated with the refinancing of senior notes in fiscal  which did not recur in fiscal  as well as lower average outstanding borrowings at slightly higher weighted average interest rates in fiscal provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to reported the same period one year ago 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a net benefit of million associated with restructuring charges incurred in connection with closing the company s ostrava plant facility and a net benefit of million due to the expiration of a non us statute of limitation period during fiscal and the settlement of us audits 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal were billion  an increase of million or when compared to fiscal engines segment net sales for fiscal were approximately billion  which was million or higher than the same period in fiscal despite a decline in total unit shipment volumes 
this increase from the same period in fiscal is primarily due to higher international engine unit shipments  a favorable mix of product shipped that reflected proportionately larger volumes of units used on commercial applications  improved engine pricing and a million foreign currency benefit  partially offset by reduced engine shipments primarily to customers in north america 
products segment net sales for fiscal were million  which was million or higher than the same period in fiscal this improvement was primarily due to increased sales in our australia and europe markets  partially offset by reduced unit shipment volumes of lawn and garden equipment  pressure washers and portable generators in the domestic market 
gross profit the consolidated gross profit percentage was in fiscal  up from in fiscal the engines segment gross profit percentage was for fiscal  an improvement from in fiscal this improvement was due to a favorable mix of products shipped  improved engine pricing  increased manufacturing efficiencies  a million foreign currency benefit and increased absorption on higher production volumes  partially offset by higher commodity costs and increased manufacturing wages and benefits  including a million increase in pension benefits expense 
the products segment gross profit percentage decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal the decline between years resulted from higher manufacturing spending and budget conscious customers purchasing lower margin units  partially offset by increased sales of premium dealer lawn and garden products  increased unit pricing  and a million foreign currency benefit 
the increase in manufacturing spending relates to higher commodity costs  manufacturing inefficiencies in the first half of fiscal in launching new products and increased warranty  and increased freight expenses  partially offset by million in incremental cost savings associated with the closure of our jefferson  wisconsin manufacturing facility in fiscal engineering  selling  general and administrative costs engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or from fiscal the engines segment engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal the increase was due to higher international selling expenses and increased salaries and benefits  which included a million increase in pension benefits expense 
the products segment fiscal engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses of million increased by million in fiscal primarily related to increased international selling expenses and million of unfavorable foreign currency 
goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing 
based on a combination of factors  including the influence of prolonged macro economic conditions on the lawn and garden market in the us and the operating results of the products segment which lacked the benefit of certain weather related events that are favorable to the business during the past two years  the company s forecasted cash flow estimates used in the goodwill assessment were adversely impacted 
as a result  the company concluded that the carrying value of the products reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
the non cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  which was determined by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit 
this impairment charge is a non cash expense that did not adversely affect the company s debt position  cash flow  liquidity or compliance with financial covenants under its credit facilities 
no impairment charges were recorded within the engines segment 
restructuring actions in fiscal  the company made organization changes that involved a reduction of salaried employee headcount 
these organization changes resulted in restructuring charges of million  consisting of million due to the modification of certain vesting conditions for the company s stock incentive awards and approximately million for severance and other related employee separation costs associated with the reduction 
interest expense interest expense was million lower for fiscal as compared to fiscal due to lower average outstanding borrowings and the reduced interest rate associated with the senior notes due that were issued in december  partially offset by million of pre tax charges related to the redemption premium on the senior notes and the write off of related deferred financing costs 
other income other income increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to a million increase in equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fiscal income tax provision includes million of income tax benefit related to the million non cash goodwill impairment charge 
approximately million of the goodwill impairment was related to non deductible goodwill associated with past stock acquisitions for which a tax benefit was not recorded 
the remaining goodwill impairment generated the million of tax benefit 
due to the significant impact the impairment charge had on the effective tax rate  the company believes the tax benefit and the effective tax rate excluding the million impairment charge are more meaningful comparisons to the fiscal period 
excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charge  the effective tax rate was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the annual fluctuations reflect the impact of changes in foreign earnings at different tax rates  the taxation of dividends from foreign operations as well as the resolution of certain tax matters 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal years  and net cash provided by operating activities were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal were million lower compared to fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to a million reduction in the decrease in accounts receivable compared to the previous year  which was partly due to million of delayed funding under the company s dealer inventory financing facility with ge capital commercial distribution finance implemented in fiscal  and cash contributions to the pension plan of million in fiscal the fiscal net cash provided by operating activities were million lower than fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to working capital requirements to replenish inventory from lower levels at the end of fiscal and due to timing of payments associated with accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these cash flows include capital expenditures of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the capital expenditures relate primarily to reinvestment in equipment  capacity additions and new products 
net cash used in financing activities were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the company repurchased treasury stock at a total cost of million 
there were no treasury stock repurchases in fiscal years or in fiscal  as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company incurred million of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of its revolving credit facility 
in fiscal  as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due december  during fiscal  the net proceeds of which were primarily used to redeem the million outstanding principal amount of the senior notes due march  the company incurred million of deferred financing costs in connection with the issuance of the senior notes in fiscal in fiscal  the company reduced its outstanding debt by million 
the company paid cash dividends on the common stock of million in each of fiscal years  and future liquidity and capital resources in december  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due december net proceeds were primarily used to redeem the remaining outstanding principal of the senior notes due march in october  the company entered into a million multicurrency credit agreement the revolver 
the revolver replaced the company s previous amended and restated multicurrency credit agreement dated as of july  the revolver has a term of five years and all outstanding borrowings on the revolver are due and payable on october  the initial maximum availability under the revolving credit facility is million 
availability under the revolving credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
the company may from time to time increase the maximum availability under the revolving credit facility by up to million if certain conditions are satisfied 
there were no borrowings under the revolver as of july  in august  subsequent to the end of fiscal  the company announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly dividend from per share to per share on its common stock  payable on or after october  to shareholders of record at the close of business on august  in august  the board of directors of briggs stratton authorized up to million in funds for use in a common share repurchase program with an expiration of june  the common share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of shares of the company s common stock on the open market or in private transactions from time to time  depending on market conditions and certain governing loan covenants 
as of the end of fiscal  the company repurchased  shares on the open market at an average price of per share

in august  subsequent to the end of fiscal  the board of directors of briggs stratton authorized an additional million in funds associated with the common share repurchase program and an extension of the expiration date to june  the common share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of shares of the company s common stock on the open market or in private transactions from time to time  depending on market conditions and certain governing loan covenants 
the company expects capital expenditures to be approximately to million in fiscal these anticipated expenditures reflect our plans to continue to reinvest in efficient equipment and innovative new products 
on july   the moving ahead for progress in the st century act map act was signed into law 
the map act included certain pension related provisions which included changes to the methodology used to determine discount rates for erisa funding purposes for qualified defined benefit pension plans 
based on historical interest rates  the map act allows plan sponsors to utilize a higher discount rate to value pension liabilities  which results in lower required pension plan contributions under erisa 
based upon current regulations and actuarial studies the company is required to make minimum contributions to the qualified pension plan of million in fiscal the company may be required to make further contributions in future years depending on the actual return on plan assets and the funded status of the plan in future periods 
management believes that available cash  cash generated from operations  existing lines of credit and access to debt markets will be adequate to fund the company s capital requirements and operational needs for the foreseeable future 
the revolver and the senior notes contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants include restrictions on the company s ability to pay dividends  repurchase shares  incur indebtedness  create liens  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  consolidate or merge with other entities  sell or lease all or substantially all of its assets  and dispose of assets or the proceeds of sales of its assets 
the revolver contains financial covenants that require the company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and impose a maximum average leverage ratio 
as of july   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
financial strategy management believes that the value of the company is enhanced if the capital invested in operations yields a cash return that is greater than the cost of capital 
consequently  management s first priority is to reinvest capital into physical assets and products that maintain or grow the global cost leadership and market positions that the company has achieved  and drive the economic value of the company 
management s next financial objective is to identify strategic acquisitions or alliances that enhance revenues and provide a superior economic return 
finally  management believes that when capital cannot be invested for returns greater than the cost of capital  the company should return capital to the capital providers through dividends and or share repurchases 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements or significant guarantees to third parties not fully recorded in our balance sheets or fully disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s significant contractual obligations include our debt agreements and certain employee benefit plans 
contractual obligations a summary of the company s expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of july  is as follows in thousands total fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other liabilities a a includes an estimate of future expected funding requirements related to our pension plans 
any further funding requirements for pension plans beyond fiscal cannot be estimated at this time 
because their future cash outflows are uncertain  liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and other sundry items are excluded from the table above 
critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are more fully described in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies represent the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
there have been no material changes made to the company s critical accounting policies and estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed arising from business combinations 
goodwill is not amortized 
the company evaluates goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of the end of the fourth fiscal quarter  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired  by applying a fair value based test and  if impairment occurs  the amount of impaired goodwill is written off immediately 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the carrying values of each of the company s reporting units to their estimated fair values as of the test dates 
the company has determined that its reporting units are the same as its reportable segments  engines and products 
the estimates of fair value of the reporting units are computed using an income approach 
the income approach utilizes a multi year forecast of estimated cash flows and a terminal value at the end of the cash flow period 
the forecast period assumptions consist of internal projections that are based on the company s budget and long range strategic plan 
the discount rate used at the test date is the weighted average cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
the sum of the fair values of the reporting units is reconciled to the company s current market capitalization based upon the company s trailing day average stock price plus an estimated control premium 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its book value  goodwill of the reporting unit is not deemed impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not performed 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of its existing tangible assets and liabilities as well as existing identified intangible assets and previously unrecognized intangible assets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the unallocated portion of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company performed the annual impairment test on its engines and products reporting units as of july  the impairment testing performed by the company at july  indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount  including recorded goodwill and as such  no further impairment existed 
such impairment testing indicated that the estimated fair value of the products reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount by 
the estimated fair value of the engines reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
in fiscal  the impairment analysis determined that the goodwill balance of the products reporting unit was impaired 
as a result  the company recognized a million non cash goodwill impairment charge during fiscal the assumptions included in the impairment test require judgment  and changes to these inputs could impact the results of the calculation 
other than management s internal projections of future cash flows  the primary assumptions used in the impairment test were the weighted average cost of capital  long term growth rates and the control premium 
trademarks are not amortized 
if impairment occurs  the impaired amount of the trademark is written off immediately 
for purposes of the trademark impairment analysis  the company performs its assessment of fair value based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method 
this methodology assumes that  in lieu of ownership  a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets 
the company determines the fair value of each trademark by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net sales discounted using a risk adjusted cost of capital 
the company believes the relief from royalty method to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets 
sales growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions  recent sales trends  discussions with customers  planned timing of new product launches and many other variables 
each royalty rate is based on profitability of the business to which it relates and observed market royalty rates 
the methods of assessing fair value for goodwill and trademark impairment purposes require significant judgments to be made by management 
although the company s cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the expected future cash flows attributable to these businesses 
the growth rates and gross profit margins used for the terminal value calculations and the discount rates of the respective reporting units as of july  were as follows terminal growth rate terminal gross profit margin discount rate engines products changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
definite lived intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and patents 
these definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment testing if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
income taxes the company s estimate of income taxes payable  deferred income taxes  tax contingencies and the effective tax rate is based on a complex analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal  state and foreign income tax laws  the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities  estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions  and current accounting standards 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 
in addition  federal  state and foreign taxing authorities periodically review the company s estimates and interpretation of income tax laws 
adjustments to the effective income tax rate and recorded tax related assets and liabilities may occur in future periods if actual results differ significantly from original estimates and interpretations 
pension and other postretirement plans the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
these rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance  which is essential in the current volatile market 
actuarial valuations at july  used a discount rate of and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of moody s aa or higher rated bonds  resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows 
a decrease in the discount rate would decrease annual pension service and interest costs by approximately million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase our annual pension service and interest costs by approximately million 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  the company considers the historical returns on plan assets  adjusted for forward looking considerations  including inflation assumptions and active management of the plan s invested assets  knowing that our investment performance has been in the top decile compared to other plans 
changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans  stockholders equity and related expense 
we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and  therefore  cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 
the funded status of the company s pension plan is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets 
the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by the employees service adjusted for future potential wage increases 
at july  the fair value of plan assets was less than the projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
on july   the moving ahead for progress in the st century act map act was signed into law 
the map act included certain pension related provisions which included changes to the methodology used to determine discount rates for erisa funding purposes for qualified defined benefit pension plans 
based on historical interest rates  the map act allows plan sponsors to utilize a higher discount rate to value pension liabilities  which results in lower required pension plan contributions under erisa 
based upon current regulations and actuarial studies the company is required to make minimum contributions to the qualified pension plan of million in fiscal the company may be required to make further contributions in future years depending on the actual return on plan assets and the funded status of the plan in future periods 
the other postretirement benefits obligation and related expense or income are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the health care trend rate 
an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and would increase the service and interest cost by million 
a corresponding decrease of one percentage point  would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by million and decrease the service and interest cost by million 
for pension and postretirement benefits  actuarial gains and losses are accounted for in accordance with us gaap 
refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
other reserves the reserves for customer rebates  warranty  product liability  inventory and doubtful accounts are fact specific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations  historical experience  and current and expected economic conditions 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired before performing quantitative impairment testing 
the amendments do not change the measurement of impairment losses 
this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
management does not expect adoption of this asu to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the two step goodwill impairment model that is currently in place 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value  the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary 
the qualitative assessment is optional  allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative assessment 
this update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
management does not expect adoption of this asu to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income  which amends current comprehensive income guidance 
this asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
instead  it requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
under the two statement approach  the first statement would include components of net income  which is consistent with the income statement format used today  and the second statement would include components of other comprehensive income oci 
the asu does not change the items that must be reported in oci 
asu will be effective for public companies for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
management does not expect adoption of this asu to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
other matters labor agreement the company has collective bargaining agreements with its unions 
these agreements expire at various times during calendar year emissions the united states environmental protection agency epa  the california air resources board carb  canada and the european union eu have adopted multiple stages of emission standards for small air cooled engines 
the company currently has product offerings that comply with those standards 
in addition  china has adopted emission standards which parallel those adopted by epa and are being phased in from to the company has specific products that meet these standards and are certified for sale in china 
australia has announced that it will be adopting emission standards 
these standards are generally expected to be based on the epa standards  but a timetable for their adoption has not yet been published 
the company does not anticipate that compliance with either of these emission standards will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or operations as they are expected to be substantially similar to the existing standards adopted by epa  carb  canada and the eu 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
to reduce the risk from changes in certain foreign exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates  the company uses financial instruments 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against various currencies 
the company purchases components in euros from third parties and receives euros for certain products sold to european customers and receives canadian dollars for certain products sold to canadian customers 
the yen is used to purchase engines from the company s joint venture 
the company s foreign subsidiaries earnings are also influenced by fluctuations of local currencies  including the australian dollar  against the us dollar as these subsidiaries purchase components and inventory from vendors and the parent in us dollars 
forward foreign exchange contracts are used to partially hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
at july   the company had the following forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with the fair value gains losses shown in thousands hedge currency notional value fair market value conversion currency gain loss at fair value australian dollar us euro us japanese yen us fluctuations in currency exchange rates may also impact the shareholders investment in the company 
amounts invested in the company s non us subsidiaries and joint ventures are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at fiscal year end 
the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders investment as accumulated other comprehensive income 
the cumulative translation adjustments component of shareholders investment decreased million during fiscal using the year end exchange rates  the total amount invested in non us subsidiaries on july  was approximately million 
commodity prices the company is exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities  including steel  natural gas  copper and aluminum

the maturities of these contracts coincide with the expected usage of the commodities for periods up to the next twenty four months 
interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings  depending on general economic conditions 
on july   the company had the following short term loan outstanding in thousands currency amount weighted average interest rate us dollars this loan has a variable interest rate 
assuming borrowings are outstanding for an entire year  an increase decrease of one percentage point in the weighted average interest rate would increase decrease interest expense by thousand 
on july   long term loans consisted of the following in thousands description amount maturity weighted average interest rate senior notes december the senior notes carry a fixed rate of interest and are therefore not subject to market fluctuation 
the company is also exposed to interest rate risk associated with programs under which the company shares the expense of financing certain dealer and distributor inventories through a third party financing source 
the company enters into interest rate swaps to manage a portion of this interest rate risk 
the swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and are used to effectively fix the interest payments to a third party financing source  exclusive of lender spreads  ranging from to for a notional principal amount of million with expiration dates ranging from july to may
