the distribution was made to shareholders and partners of record as of february  and was paid on february  the trust s board of trustees reviews the dividend quarterly and there can be no assurance as to the manner in which future dividends will be paid or that the current dividend level will be maintained in future periods 
competition the business of owning  developing  operating and leasing of multifamily  office and retail properties is highly competitive 
we compete with domestic and foreign financial institutions  other reits  life insurance companies  pension trusts  trust funds  partnerships and individual investors for the acquisition of properties 
see item a risk factors risks associated with our operations we may not be able to complete acquisitions and  even if we complete acquisitions  we may not achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from our acquisitions  which would adversely affect our results of operations in this form k for further discussion 
with respect to our multifamily business  we also compete with other quality apartment and for sale condominium projects owned by public and private companies 
the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular market could adversely affect our ability to lease our multifamily properties  to develop and lease new properties or sell existing properties  as well as the rents we are able to charge 
in addition  other forms of residential properties  including single family housing and town homes  provide housing alternatives to potential residents of quality apartment communities or potential purchasers of for sale condominium units 
with respect to the multifamily business  we compete for residents in our apartment communities based on our high level of resident service  the quality of our apartment communities including our landscaping and amenity offerings and the desirability of our locations 
resident leases at our apartment communities are priced competitively based on market conditions  supply and demand characteristics  and the quality and resident service offerings of the communities 
in addition  we compete for tenants in our markets primarily on the basis of property location  rent charged  services provided and the design and condition of the properties 
environmental matters we believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances 
we are not aware of any environmental condition that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position before consideration of any potential insurance coverage 
nevertheless  it is possible that there are material environmental conditions and liabilities of which we are unaware 
moreover  no assurances can be given that i future laws  ordinances or regulations or future interpretations of existing requirements will not impose any material environmental liability or ii the current environmental condition of our properties has not been or will not be affected by tenants and occupants of our properties  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of our properties or by third parties 
see item a risk factors risks associated with our operations we could incur significant costs related to environmental issues which could adversely affect our results of operations through increased compliance costs or our financial condition if we become subject to a significant liability in this form k for further discussion 
insurance we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our majority owned properties 
we believe the policy specifications  insured limits of these policies and self insurance reserves are adequate and appropriate 
there are  however  certain types of losses  such as lease and other contract claims  which generally are not insured 
we anticipate that we will review our insurance coverage and policies from time to time to determine the appropriate levels of coverage  but we cannot predict at this time if we will be able to obtain or maintain full coverage at reasonable costs in the future 
in addition  as of december   we are self insured up to million  million and million for general liability  workers compensation and property insurance  respectively 
we are also self insured for health insurance and responsible for amounts up to  per claim and up to million per person 
our policy for all self insured risk is to accrue for expected losses on reported claims and for estimated losses related to claims incurred but not reported as of the end of the reporting period 
see item a risk factors risks associated with our operations uninsured losses or losses in excess of insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition

risk factors 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  set forth below are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us  whether oral or written 
we wish to ensure that any forward looking statements are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements in order to maximize to the fullest extent possible the protections of the safe harbor established in the private securities litigation reform act of accordingly  any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to  and are accompanied by  the following important factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from our forward looking statements 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and ability to make distributions to the trust s shareholders could be materially and adversely affected  and the trading price of the trust s common shares could decline 
these forward looking statements are based on management s present expectations and beliefs about future events 
as with any projection or forecast  these statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances 
there may be additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial that also may impair our business operations 
you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 
risks associated with real estate we face numerous risks associated with the real estate industry that could adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs 
as a real estate company  we are subject to various changes in real estate conditions  particularly in the sunbelt region where our properties are concentrated  and any negative trends in such real estate conditions may adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs 
these conditions include changes in national  regional and local economic conditions  which may be negatively impacted by concerns about inflation  deflation  government deficits including the european sovereign debt crisis  high unemployment rates  decreased consumer confidence and liquidity concerns  particularly in markets in which we have a high concentration of properties  fluctuations in interest rates  which could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all  the inability of residents and tenants to pay rent  the existence and quality of the competition  such as the attractiveness of our properties as compared to our competitors properties based on considerations such as convenience of location  rental rates  amenities and safety record  increased operating costs  including increased real property taxes  maintenance  insurance and utilities costs  weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather related expenses  oversupply of multifamily  commercial space or single family housing or a reduction in demand for real estate in the markets in which our properties are located  a favorable interest rate environment that may result in a significant number of potential residents of our multifamily apartment communities deciding to purchase homes instead of renting  changes in  or increased costs of compliance with  laws and or governmental regulations  including those governing usage  zoning  the environment and taxes  rent control or stabilization laws  or other laws regulating rental housing  which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs  and changing trends in the demand by consumers for merchandise offered by retailers conducting business at our retail properties 
moreover  other factors may adversely affect our results of operations  including potential liability under environmental and other laws and other unforeseen events  many of which are discussed elsewhere in the following risk factors 
any or all of these factors could materially adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs 
increased competition and increased affordability of residential homes could limit our ability to retain our residents  lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 
our multifamily apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents  including other multifamily apartment communities and single family rental homes  as well as owner occupied single family and multifamily homes 
competitive housing in a particular area and an increase in the affordability of owner occupied single 
table of contents family and multifamily homes due to  among other things  declining housing prices  mortgage interest rates and tax incentives and government programs to promote home ownership  could adversely affect our ability to retain residents  lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 
as a result  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
we are subject to significant regulations  which could adversely affect our results of operations through increased costs and or an inability to pursue business opportunities 
local zoning and use laws  environmental statutes and other governmental requirements may restrict or increase the costs of our development  expansion  rehabilitation and reconstruction activities and thus may prevent or delay us from taking advantage of business opportunities 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines  awards to private litigants of damages against us  substantial litigation costs and substantial costs of remediation or compliance 
in addition  we cannot predict what requirements may be enacted in the future or that such requirements will not increase our costs of regulatory compliance or prohibit us from pursuing business opportunities that could be profitable to us  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
the illiquidity of real estate investments may significantly impede our ability to respond to changes in economic or market conditions  which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid generally  and may become even more illiquid during periods of economic downturn 
as a result  we may not be able to sell a property or properties quickly or on favorable terms in response to changes in the economy or other conditions when it otherwise may be prudent to do so 
this inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our properties could adversely affect our results of operations if we cannot sell an unprofitable property 
our financial condition could also be adversely affected if we were  for example  unable to sell one or more of our properties in order to meet our debt obligations upon maturity 
in addition  the tax laws applicable to reits require that we hold our properties for investment  rather than primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business  which may cause us to forgo or defer sales of properties that otherwise would be in our best interest 
therefore  we may be unable to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic  market or other conditions  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act and fair housing act could result in substantial costs 
under the americans with disabilities act of  or ada  and the fair housing amendment act of  or fhaa  and various state and local laws  all public accommodations and commercial facilities must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
compliance with these requirements could involve removal of structural barriers from certain disabled persons entrances 
other federal  state and local laws may require modifications to or restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to such means of access 
noncompliance with the ada  fhaa or related laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines by government authorities  awards to private litigants of damages against us  substantial litigation costs and the incurrence of additional costs associated with bringing the properties into compliance  any of which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks associated with our operations our revenues are significantly influenced by demand for multifamily properties generally  and a decrease in such demand will likely have a greater adverse effect on our revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio 
our portfolio is focused predominately on multifamily properties 
as a result  we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry  and a decrease in the demand for multifamily properties would likely have a greater adverse effect on our rental revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio 
resident demand at multifamily properties was adversely affected by the recent us recession  including the reduction in spending  reduced home prices and high unemployment  together with the price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the debt and equity markets  as well as the rate of household formation or population growth in our markets  changes in interest rates or changes in supply of  or demand for  similar or competing multifamily properties in an area 
if the economic recovery slows or stalls  these conditions could persist and we could experience downward pressure on occupancy and market rents at our multifamily properties  which could cause a decrease in our rental revenue 
any such decrease could impair our ability to satisfy our substantial debt service obligations or make distributions to our shareholders 

table of contents substantially all of our properties are located in the sunbelt region  and adverse economic and other developments in that region could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
substantially all of our properties are located in the sunbelt region of the united states 
in particular  we derived approximately of our net operating income in from top quartile cities located in the sunbelt region 
as a result  we are particularly susceptible to adverse economic  market and other conditions in these geographic areas  including increased unemployment  industry slowdowns  business layoffs or downsizing  decreased consumer confidence and relocation of businesses 
any such adverse developments in the sunbelt region and in particular the areas of or near to atlanta  ga  charlotte  nc or austin and dallas fort worth  tx could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our inability to dispose of our existing inventory of for sale residential assets could adversely affect our results of operations 
as of december   we had for sale residential units remaining and residential lots for sale  which may expose us to the following risks  many of which could cause us to hold properties for a longer period than is otherwise desirable local real estate market conditions  such as oversupply or reduction in demand  may result in reduced or fluctuating sales  for sale properties acquired for development usually generate little or no cash flow until completion of development and sale of a significant number of homes or condominium units and may experience operating deficits after the date of completion and until such homes or condominium units are sold  we may abandon development or conversion opportunities that we have already begun to explore  and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring any such opportunities  we may be unable to close on sales of individual units under contract  buyers may be unable to qualify for financing  sales prices may be lower than anticipated  competition from other condominiums and other types of residential housing may result in reduced or fluctuating sales  we could be subject to liability claims from condominium associations or others asserting that construction performed was defective  resulting in litigation and or settlement discussions  and we may be unable to attract sales prices with respect to our for sale assets that compensate us for our costs which may result in impairment charges 
in  we accelerated our plans to dispose of our for sale residential assets  including condominium conversions 
since then  economic and market conditions have made it particularly difficult to sell units in a timely manner 
during   and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  of non cash impairment charges primarily related to certain for sale residential units  a commercial development and certain land parcels 
see note real estate activity impairment and other losses in the notes to consolidated financial statements of the trust and crlp contained in item of this form k for additional information regarding these impairment charges 
if market conditions do not improve or if there is further market deterioration  it may impact the number of projects we can sell  the timing of the sales and or the prices at which we can sell them 
if we are unable to sell projects  we may incur additional impairment charges on projects previously impaired as well as on projects not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may exist  which would decrease the value of our assets as reflected on our balance sheet and adversely affect our shareholders equity 
there can be no assurances of the amount or pace of future for sale residential sales and closings 
we may be unable to lease space at our new properties or renew leases or re lease space at our existing properties  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we derive the majority of our income from residents and tenants who lease space from us at our properties 
a number of factors may adversely affect our ability to attract residents and tenants at favorable rental rates and generate sufficient income  including local conditions such as an oversupply of  or reduction in demand for  multifamily or commercial properties  the attractiveness of our properties to residents  shoppers and tenants  the availability of low interest mortgages for single family home buyers  decreases in market rental rates  and our ability to collect rent from our residents and tenants 

table of contents the residents at our multifamily properties generally enter into leases with an initial term ranging from six months to one year 
tenants at our office properties generally enter into leases with an initial term ranging from three to ten years and tenants at our retail properties generally enter into leases with an initial term ranging from one to ten years 
as leases expire at our existing properties  residents and tenants may elect not to renew them 
even if our residents and tenants do renew or if we can re lease the space  the terms of renewal or re leasing  including the cost of required renovations may be less favorable than current lease terms 
in addition  for new properties  we may be unable to attract enough residents and tenants  or the occupancy rates and rents may not be sufficient to make the property profitable 
moreover  continued weakness in the economy or a future recession may impede the ability of our residents or tenants to perform their contractual obligations  which could lead to an increase in defaults by residents and tenants 
if we are unable to renew the leases or re lease the space at our existing properties promptly and or lease the space at our new properties  or if the rental rates upon renewal or re leasing at existing properties are significantly lower than expected rates  or if there is an increase in tenant defaults  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if recent adverse global market and economic conditions worsen or do not fully recover  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow may be materially adversely affected 
overall financial market and economic conditions have been challenging in recent years  beginning with the credit crisis and recession in challenging economic conditions persisted throughout  including a worsening european sovereign debt crisis and volatility in the debt and equity markets  and although the us economy has emerged from the recent recession  high levels of unemployment have persisted and residential and commercial real estate markets have been slow to recover 
if these conditions continue or worsen  there could be an increase in defaults by residents at our multifamily properties and tenants at our commercial properties  which could adversely affect our revenues 
furthermore  our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates has been adversely affected in recent years by the increase in supply and deterioration in the multifamily market stemming from the recent recession 
with regard to our ability to lease our multifamily properties  the increasing rental of excess for sale condominiums  which increases the supply of multifamily units and housing alternatives  may further reduce our ability to lease our multifamily units and further depress rental rates in certain markets 
with regard to for sale residential properties  the market for our for sale residential properties depends on an active demand for new for sale housing and high consumer confidence 
decreased demand  exacerbated by tighter credit standards for home buyers and foreclosures  has further contributed to an oversupply of housing alternatives  adversely affecting the timing of sales and price at which we are able to sell our for sale residential properties and thereby adversely affecting our profits from for sale residential properties 
we cannot predict how long demand and other factors in the real estate market will remain unfavorable  but if the economic recovery slows or stalls  our ability to lease our properties  our ability to increase or maintain rental rates in certain markets and the pace of condominium sales and closings and or the related sales prices may weaken in our expenses may remain constant or increase  even if our revenues decrease  causing our results of operations to be adversely affected 
costs associated with our business  such as mortgage payments  real estate taxes  insurance premiums and maintenance costs  are relatively inflexible and generally do not decrease  and may increase  when a property is not fully occupied  rental rates decrease  a tenant fails to pay rent or other circumstances cause a reduction in property revenues 
as a result  if revenues drop  we may not be able to reduce our expenses accordingly  which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to collect balances due from any tenants in bankruptcy 
we cannot assure you that any tenant that files for bankruptcy protection or becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings will continue to pay us rent 
a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants would bar all efforts by us to collect pre bankruptcy debts from that tenant  or its property  unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court 
a tenant bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases  and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums 
if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy  we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages 
any unsecured claim we hold may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims  and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected 
as a result  it is likely that we will recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold which would result in a reduction in our cash flow and in the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders 

table of contents risks associated with the property management  leasing and brokerage businesses could adversely affect our results of operations by decreasing our revenues 
in addition to the risks we face as a result of our ownership of real estate  we face risks relating to the property management  leasing and brokerage businesses of cpsi  including risks that management contracts or service agreements with third party owners will be terminated and lost to competitors  contracts will not be renewed upon expiration or will not be available for renewal on terms consistent with current terms  and leasing and brokerage activity generally may decline 
each of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations by decreasing our revenues 
we could incur significant costs related to environmental issues which could adversely affect our results of operations through increased compliance costs or our financial condition if we become subject to a significant liability 
under federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  a current or previous owner or operator of real property  and parties that generate or transport hazardous substances that are disposed of on real property  may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating hazardous substances on or under or released from the property and for damages to natural resources 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation liability act  and similar state laws  may impose liability on a joint and several basis  regardless of whether the owner  operator or other responsible party knew of or was at fault for the release or presence of hazardous substances 
in connection with the ownership or operation of our properties  we could be liable in the future for costs associated with investigation and remediation of hazardous substances released at or from such properties 
the costs of any required remediation and related liability as to any property could be substantial under these laws and could exceed the value of the property and or our assets 
the presence of hazardous substances or the failure to properly remediate those substances may result in our being liable for damages suffered by a third party for personal injury  property damage  cleanup costs  damage to natural resources or otherwise and may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent a property or to borrow funds using the property as collateral 
environmental laws also may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination 
moreover  if contamination is discovered on our properties  environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which that property may be used or how businesses may be operated on that property 
in addition  our properties are subject to various federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws  including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks 
noncompliance with these environmental  health and safety laws could subject us or our tenants to liability 
these environmental liabilities could affect a tenant s ability to make rental payments to us 
moreover  compliance with these laws may require significant expenditures 
interpretation of these laws and the restrictions themselves may change from time to time  and these changes may result in additional expenditures in order to achieve compliance 
we cannot assure you that a material environmental claim or compliance obligation will not arise in the future 
the costs of defending against any claims of liability  of remediating a contaminated property  or of complying with future environmental requirements could be substantial and affect our operating results 
in addition  if a judgment is obtained against us or we otherwise become subject to a significant environmental liability  our financial condition may be adversely affected 
costs associated with addressing indoor air quality issues  moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be costly 
as a general matter  concern about indoor exposure to mold or other air contaminants has been increasing as such exposure has been alleged to have a variety of adverse effects on health 
as a result  there have been a number of lawsuits in our industry against owners and managers of apartment communities relating to indoor air quality  moisture infiltration and resulting mold 
the terms of our property and general liability policies generally exclude certain mold related claims 
should an uninsured loss arise against us  we would be required to use our funds to resolve the issue  including litigation costs 
we make no assurance that liabilities resulting from indoor air quality  moisture infiltration and the presence of or exposure to mold will not have a future impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as the owner or operator of real property  we could become subject to liability for asbestos containing building materials in the buildings on our properties 
some of our properties may contain asbestos containing materials 
environmental laws typically require that owners or operators of buildings with asbestos containing building materials properly manage and maintain these materials  adequately 
table of contents inform or train those who may come in contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions  including removal or other abatement  in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition 
these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements 
in addition  third parties may be entitled to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos containing building materials 
uninsured losses or losses in excess of insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition 
as of december   we are self insured up to million  million and million for general liability  workers compensation and property insurance  respectively 
we are also self insured for health insurance and responsible for amounts up to  per claim and up to million per person  according to plan policy limits 
if the actual costs incurred to cover such uninsured claims are significantly greater than our budgeted costs  our financial condition will be adversely affected 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance in amounts that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties and appropriate given the relative risk of loss and the cost of the coverage 
there are  however  certain types of losses  such as lease and other contract claims  acts of war or terrorism  acts of god  and in some cases  earthquakes  hurricanes and flooding that generally are not insured because such coverage is not available or it is not available at commercially reasonable rates 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in the damaged property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations  and other factors also might make it impractical or undesirable to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 
in addition  if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness  we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness  even if these properties were irreparably damaged 
furthermore  we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable costs in the future  as the costs associated with property and casualty renewals may be higher than anticipated 
we may be unable to develop new properties or redevelop existing properties successfully  which could adversely affect our results of operations due to unexpected costs  delays and other contingencies 
as part of our operating strategy  we intend to continue to develop new properties and to expand and or redevelop existing properties as market conditions warrant 
development activity may be conducted through wholly owned affiliates or through joint ventures 
in addition to the risks associated with real estate investments in general as described above  there are significant risks associated with development activities including the following we may be unable to obtain  or face delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased development costs and or lower than expected leases  we may incur development costs for a property that exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other costs  changes in development plans or unforeseen environmental conditions  which could make completion of the property more costly or uneconomical  land  insurance and construction costs may be higher than expected in our markets  therefore  we may be unable to attract rents that compensate for these increases in costs  we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore  and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring any such opportunities  rental rates and occupancy levels may be lower than anticipated  changes in applicable zoning and land use laws may require us to abandon projects prior to their completion  resulting in the loss of development costs incurred up to the time of abandonment  and possible delays in completion because of construction delays  delays in the receipt of zoning  occupancy and other approvals  or other factors outside of our control 
in addition  if a project is delayed  certain residents and tenants may have the right to terminate their leases 
furthermore  from time to time we may utilize tax exempt bond financing through the issuance of community development and special assessment district bonds to fund development costs 
under the terms of such bond financings  we may be responsible for paying assessments on the underlying property to meet debt service obligations on the bonds until the underlying property is sold 
accordingly  if we are unable to complete or sell a development property subject to such bond financing and we are forced to hold the property longer than we originally projected  we may be obligated to continue to pay assessments to meet debt service obligations under the bonds 
if we are unable to pay the assessments  a default will occur under the bonds and the property could be foreclosed upon 
any one or more of these risks may cause us to incur unexpected development costs  which 
table of contents would negatively affect our results of operations 
our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision making authority  our reliance on our joint venture partners financial condition  any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners 
we have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire properties with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures 
our investments in these joint ventures involve risks not customarily associated with our wholly owned properties  including the following we share decision making authority with some of our joint venture partners regarding major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and the joint venture properties  such as the acquisition of properties  the sale of the properties or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the properties  which may prevent us from taking actions that are opposed by those joint venture partners  prior consent of our joint venture partners is required for a sale or transfer to a third party of our interests in the joint venture  which restricts our ability to dispose of our interest in the joint venture  our joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions  which may delay construction or development of a joint venture property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture  our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to the joint venture properties that conflict with our business interests and goals  which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership  management or disposition of such properties  disputes with our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and distract our officers and or trustees from focusing their time and effort on our business  and possibly disrupt the day to day operations of the property such as by delaying the implementation of important decisions until the conflict or dispute is resolved see  for example  the discussion under item legal proceedings in this form k  our joint venture partners may be unsuccessful in refinancing or replacing existing mortgage indebtedness  or may choose not to do so  which could adversely affect the value of our joint venture interest  we may suffer losses as a result of the actions of our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments  our joint venture partner may elect to sell or transfer its interests in the joint venture to a third party  which may result in our loss of management and leasing responsibilities and fees that we currently receive from the joint venture properties  and we may  in certain circumstances  be liable for the actions of our joint venture partners  and their activities could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit  even though we do not control the joint venture 
if any of the foregoing were to occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we intend to cooperate with our joint venture partners in connection with their efforts to refinance and or replace any outstanding joint venture indebtedness  which may include property dispositions by the joint venture and or additional capital contributions by us from time to time 
there can be no assurance that our joint ventures will be successful in refinancing and or replacing such existing debt at maturity or otherwise 
the failure to refinance and or restructure such debt could materially adversely affect the value of our joint venture interests and therefore the value of our joint venture investments  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to complete acquisitions and  even if we complete acquisitions  we may not achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from our acquisitions  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
we will acquire multifamily properties only if they meet our criteria and we believe that they will enhance our future financial performance and the value of our portfolio 
our belief  however  is based on certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property and is subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors  many of which are forward looking and are uncertain in nature or are beyond our control 
in particular  our acquisition activities pose the following risks to our ongoing operations we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors  including other publicly traded reits  private reits  domestic and foreign financial institutions  life insurance companies  pension trusts  trust funds  investment banking firms  and private institutional investment funds  
table of contents even if we are able to acquire a desired property  competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price  we may not achieve the increased occupancy  cost savings and operational efficiencies projected at the time of acquiring a property  management may incur significant costs and expend significant resources evaluating and negotiating potential acquisitions  including those that we subsequently are unable to complete  we may acquire properties or other real estate related investments that are not initially accretive to our results upon acquisition  and we may not successfully manage and operate those properties to meet our expectations  we may acquire properties outside of our existing markets where we are less familiar with local economic and market conditions  some properties may be worth less or may generate less revenue than  or simply not perform as well as  we believed at the time of the acquisition  we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all  we may be unable to reinvest restricted proceeds pending the fulfillment of section exchange requirements  we may spend more than budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties  and we may acquire properties without any recourse  or with only limited recourse  for liabilities  whether known or unknown  such as clean up of environmental contamination  claims by tenants  vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties  and claims for indemnification by general partners  trustees  officers  and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 
if we cannot finance property acquisitions in a timely manner and on favorable terms  or operate acquired properties to meet our financial expectations  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
risks associated with our indebtedness and financing activities our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   the amount of our total debt was approximately billion  consisting of billion of consolidated debt and billion of our pro rata share of joint venture debt 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with  among other things  our acquisition  development and operating activities 
the degree of our leverage creates significant risks  including the following we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our funds from operations to servicing our debt and our cash flow may be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest  we may not be able to refinance some or all of our indebtedness and any refinancing may not be on terms as favorable as those of our existing indebtedness  to repay indebtedness as it matures  we may be forced to sell one or more properties  possibly on unfavorable terms  or raise additional equity at prices that may be dilutive to existing shareholders  debt service obligations will reduce funds available for distribution to our shareholders and funds available for acquisitions  development and redevelopment  we may be more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns than our competitors that have less debt  we may be limited in our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  we may not be able to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general corporate purposes  and we may default on our indebtedness  which could result in acceleration of those obligations  assignment of rents and leases and loss of properties to foreclosure 
if any one of these events were to occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we depend on external sources of capital that are outside of our control  which may affect our ability to pursue strategic opportunities  refinance or repay our indebtedness and make distributions to our shareholders 
to qualify as a reit  we must distribute to our shareholders each year at least of our reit taxable income  excluding any net capital gain 
because of these distribution requirements  it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs from income from operations 
as a result  when we engage in the development or acquisition of new properties or expansion or redevelopment of existing properties  we will continue to rely on third party sources of capital  including lines of credit  collateralized or unsecured debt both construction financing and permanent debt  and equity issuances 
our access to 
table of contents third party sources of capital depends on a number of factors  including general market conditions  the market s view of the quality of our assets  the market s perception of our growth potential  our current debt levels and our current and expected future earnings 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund our current or new developments or project expansions or our acquisition activities on terms favorable to us or at all 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient level of third party financing to fund our capital needs  our results of operations  financial condition and ability to make distributions to our shareholders may be adversely affected 
in addition  although most of our indebtedness does not require significant principal payments prior to maturity  we will need to raise additional equity capital  obtain collateralized or unsecured debt financing  issue private or public debt  or sell some of our assets to either refinance or repay our indebtedness as it matures 
for example  our existing million unsecured credit facility matures in june and we expect to refinance that facility or enter into a new credit facility prior to maturity  but there can be no assurance that the financial terms or covenants of any refinanced or new facility will be the same or as favorable as those under our existing credit facility 
if we are not successful in refinancing our debt when it becomes due  we may default under our loan obligations  enter into foreclosure proceedings  or be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms  any of which could adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations 
covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loan contain restrictions on the amount of debt we may incur and other restrictions and requirements on our operations  including the following financial ratios secured debt to total asset value ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio  total liabilities to total asset value ratio  total permitted investments to total asset value ratio  and unencumbered leverage ratio 
the indenture under which our senior unsecured debt is issued also contains financial and operating covenants including coverage ratios and limitations on the amount of debt we may incur 
certain of our mortgage indebtedness also contains customary covenants which  among other things  limit our ability  without the prior consent of the lender  to further mortgage the property  to enter into new leases or materially modify existing leases  and to discontinue insurance coverage 
these restrictions  as well as any additional restrictions which we may become subject to in connection with additional financings or refinancings  could restrict on our ability to pursue some business initiatives  effect certain transactions or make other changes to our business that may otherwise be beneficial to our company  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  violations of these covenants could cause the declaration of defaults and acceleration of any related indebtedness  which would result in adverse consequences to our financial condition 
our credit facility and unsecured term loan also contain cross default provisions that give the lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in excess of certain amounts 
in the event of a default  we may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources  which may not be available to us on attractive terms  or at all  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
potential reduction or elimination of the role that fannie mae and freddie mac play in the multifamily financing sector could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily real estate in the united states  and we have benefited from our ability to borrow from these entities 
in february  as part of the obama administration s financial industry recovery proposal  the us treasury  in consultation with the department of housing and urban development and other government agencies  issued a report that set forth options to reform the us housing market  all of which involve an eventual phasing out of fannie mae and freddie mac 
however  it is not now possible to predict the impact resulting from such a phase out may have on financing for the multifamily sector and thus on our business 
if the us government decides to eliminate fannie mae or freddie mac or reduce government support for apartment mortgage loans  and if other sources of financing do not enter the market to replace fannie mae and freddie mac  it may adversely affect our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms and thus to acquire or develop new properties 
in addition  such a decision by the us government may adversely affect the number of properties we can sell  the timing of the sales and or the prices at which we can sell them  as prospective buyers also may experience difficulty in obtaining financing on favorable terms 
as a result  our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents indebtedness secured by our properties exposes us to the possibility of foreclosure  which could result in the loss of the property that secures the indebtedness and any rents to which we would be entitled from leases on that property 
as of december   approximately of our consolidated indebtedness was secured by our real estate assets 
if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the mortgagee could foreclose upon that property  appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies 
in addition  as a result of cross collateralization or cross default provisions contained in certain of our mortgage loans  a default under one mortgage loan could result in a default on other indebtedness and cause us to lose other better performing properties  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for tax purposes  a foreclosure of any nonrecourse mortgage on any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage 
if the outstanding balance of the debt exceeds our tax basis in the property  we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure but would not receive any cash proceeds from the disposition of the property  which could adversely affect our ability to our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain sufficient third party financing for our capital needs  including development  expansion  acquisition and other activities  on favorable terms or at all  which could materially and adversely affect us 
disruptions in the credit markets generally  or relating to the real estate industry specifically  may adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing at favorable rates or at all 
in and  the us stock and credit markets experienced significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions  which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably 
those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets  making terms for certain financings less attractive  and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing  even for companies that were otherwise qualified to obtain financing 
continued volatility and uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for our capital needs  including development  expansion  acquisition and other activities  on favorable terms or at all  which may negatively affect our business 
additionally  we may be unable to refinance or extend our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness 
if a dislocation similar to that which occurred in and occurs in the future  we may be forced to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and to adjust our business plan accordingly 
such events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of the trust s common shares  preferred shares or subordinated notes 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are required to perform under various financial guarantees that we have provided with respect to certain of our joint ventures and retail developments 
from time to time  we guarantee portions of the indebtedness of certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations guarantees and other arrangements of this annual report on form k  for a description of the guarantees that we have provided with respect to the indebtedness of certain of our joint ventures as of december  from time to time  in connection with certain retail developments  we receive funding from municipalities for infrastructure costs through the issuance of bonds that are repaid primarily from sales tax revenues generated from the tenants at each respective development 
in some instances  we guarantee the shortfall  if any  of tax revenues to the debt service requirements on these bonds 
if we are required to fund any amounts related to any of these guarantees  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
in addition  we may not be able to ultimately recover funded amounts 
due to the amount of our variable rate debt  rising interest rates would adversely affect our results of operation 
as of december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt outstanding  consisting of million of our consolidated debt and million of our pro rata share of variable rate unconsolidated joint venture debt 
while we have sought to cap our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using interest rate swap agreements where appropriate  failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 
furthermore  interest rate swap agreements and other hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks  including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations 
developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  as opportunities arise  we may borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future 
as a result  a significant increase in interest rates would adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents our senior notes do not have an established trading market  therefore  holders of our notes may not be able to sell their notes 
each series of crlp s senior notes is a new issue of securities with no established trading market 
we do not intend to apply for listing of any series of notes on any national securities exchange 
the underwriters in an offering of senior notes may advise us that they intend to make a market in the notes  but they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice 
we can give no assurance as to the liquidity of or any trading market for any series of our notes 
a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in march  moody s and standard poor s lowered their credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt to ba from baa and to bb from bbb  respectively  resulting in an increase in the pricing under our credit facility from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points 
the downgrades had the effect of increasing our borrowing costs  and further downgrades  while not impacting our borrowing costs  could shorten borrowing periods  thereby adversely impacting our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and otherwise limiting our access to capital  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with our organization and structure some of our trustees and officers have conflicts of interest and could exercise influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of our shareholders 
as a result of their substantial ownership of common shares and units  messrs 
thomas lowder  our chairman and chief executive officer  james lowder and harold ripps  each of whom is a trustee  could seek to exert influence over our decisions as to sales or re financings of particular properties we own 
any such exercise of influence could produce decisions that are not in the best interest of all of the holders of interests in us 
the lowder family and their affiliates hold interests in a company that has performed insurance brokerage services with respect to our properties 
this company may perform similar services for us in the future 
as a result  the lowder family may realize benefits from transactions between this company and us that are not realized by other holders of interests in us 
in addition  given their positions with us  thomas lowder  as our chairman and chief executive officer  and james lowder  as a trustee  may be in a position to influence us to do business with companies in which the lowder family has a financial interest 
other than a specific procedure for reviewing and approving related party construction activities  we have not adopted a formal policy for the review and approval of conflict of interest transactions generally 
pursuant to our charter  our audit committee reviews and discusses with management and our independent registered public accounting firm any such transaction if deemed material and relevant to an understanding of our financial statements 
our policies and practices may not be successful in eliminating the influence of conflicts 
moreover  transactions with companies controlled by the lowder family  if any  may not be on terms as favorable to us as we could obtain in an arms length transaction with a third party 
restrictions on the acquisition and change in control of the company may have adverse effects on the value of the trust s common shares and crlp s partnership units 
various provisions of the trust s declaration of trust restrict the possibility for acquisition or change in control of us  even if the acquisition or change in control were in the shareholders interest 
as a result  the value of the trust s common shares and crlp s partnership units may be less than they would otherwise be in the absence of such restrictions 
the trust s declaration of trust contains ownership limits and restrictions on transferability 
the trust s declaration of trust contains certain restrictions on the number of common shares and preferred shares that individual shareholders may own  which is intended to ensure that we maintain our qualification as a reit 
in order for us to qualify as a reit  no more than of the value of our outstanding shares may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities during the last half of a taxable year and the shares must be beneficially owned by or more persons during at least days of a taxable year of months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year 
to help avoid violating these requirements  the trust s declaration of trust contains provisions restricting the ownership and transfer of shares in certain circumstances 
these ownership limitations provide that no person may beneficially own  or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code  more than 
table of contents  in either number of shares or value whichever is more restrictive  of any class of our outstanding shares  in number or value whichever is more restrictive  of our outstanding common shares and any outstanding excess shares  and in the case of certain excluded holders related to the lowder family by one individual  by two individuals  by three individuals  or by four individuals 
these ownership limitations may be waived by the trust s board of trustees if it receives representations and undertakings of certain facts for the protection of our reit status  and if requested  an irs ruling or opinion of counsel 
the trust s declaration of trust permits the trust s board of trustees to issue preferred shares with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
the trust s declaration of trust permits the board of trustees of the trust to issue up to  preferred shares  having those preferences  conversion or other rights  voting powers  restrictions  limitations as to distributions  qualifications  or terms or conditions of redemption as determined by the board of trustees 
thus  the board of trustees of the trust could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which some or a majority of shareholders might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price of shares 
the trust s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other possible anti takeover provisions 
the trust s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing an acquisition or change in control of the company  and  as a result could prevent our shareholders from being paid a premium for their common shares over the then prevailing market prices 
these provisions include a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent  the ability to remove trustees only at a meeting of shareholders called for that purpose  by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two thirds of the shares then outstanding and entitled to vote in the election of trustees  the limitation that a special meeting of shareholders can be called only by the president or chairman of the board or upon the written request of shareholders holding outstanding shares representing at least of all votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting  the advance written notice requirement for shareholders to nominate a trustee or submit other business before a meeting of shareholders  and the requirement that the amendment of certain provisions of the declaration of trust relating to the removal of trustees  the termination of the company and any provision that would have the effect of amending these provisions  require the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of the shares then outstanding 
we may change our business policies in the future  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
our major policies  including our policies with respect to development  acquisitions  financing  growth  operations  debt capitalization and distributions  are determined by the trust s board of trustees 
a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations  including our ability to service debt 
the trust s board of trustees may amend or revise policies from time to time in the future  and no assurance can be given that additional amendments or revisions to these policies will not result in additional charges or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to the trust s shares market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of the trust s common shares 
the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares  as a percentage of the price of the shares  relative to market interest rates 
if market interest rates increase  prospective purchasers of the trust s shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate 
higher interest rates would not  however  result in more funds for us to distribute and  in fact  would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution 
this could cause the market price of the trust s common shares to go down 
in addition  although the trust s common shares are listed on the new york stock exchange  the daily trading volume of the trust s shares may be lower than the trading volume for other industries 
as a result  our investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares 

table of contents a large number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of the trust s common shares and may be dilutive to current shareholders 
the sales of a substantial number of our common shares  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common shares 
as of december  there were  common shares authorized under our declaration of trust  as amended  of which  were outstanding as of december  our board of trustees may authorize the issuance of additional authorized but unissued common shares or other authorized but unissued securities at any time  including pursuant to share option and share purchase plans 
in addition to issuances of shares pursuant to share option and share purchase plans  as of december   we may issue up to  common shares upon redemption of currently outstanding units of our operating partnership 
we also have filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission allowing the trust to offer  from time to time  an unspecified amount of equity securities of the trust including common and preferred shares and allowing crlp to offer  from time to time  an unspecified amount of debt securities 
our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing  including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt  and equity financing  including issuances of common and preferred equity 
no prediction can be made about the effect that future distribution or sales of the trust s common or preferred shares or crlp s debt securities will have on the market price of the trust s common shares 
we may change our dividend policy 
the trust intends to continue to declare quarterly distributions on its common shares 
future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of the trust s board of trustees and the amount and timing of distributions will depend upon cash generated by operating activities  our financial condition  capital requirements  annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code  and such other factors as the trust s board of trustees deem relevant 
the trust s board of trustees reviews the dividend quarterly and there can be no assurance as to the manner in which future dividends will be paid or that the current dividend level will be maintained in future periods 
changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market s expectations with regard to our earnings and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of the trust s common shares 
we believe that the market value of a reit s equity securities is based primarily upon the market s perception of the reit s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions  and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets 
for that reason  our shares may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share 
to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes  working capital reserves or other purposes  these retained funds  while increasing the value of our underlying assets  may not correspondingly increase the market price of the trust s common shares 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet the required payments on our preferred shares and the operating partnership s preferred units 
our failure to meet the market s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our shares 
the stock markets  including the new york stock exchange  on which the trust lists its common shares  historically have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
as a result  the market price of the trust s common shares could be similarly volatile  and investors in the trust s common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following our financial condition and operating performance and the performance of other similar companies  actual or anticipated differences in our quarterly operating results  changes in our revenues or earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  publication of research reports about us or our industry by securities analysts  additions and departures of key personnel  strategic decisions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions  divestments  spin offs  joint ventures  strategic investments or changes in business strategy  the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours  the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities including securities issued by other real estate companies  an increase in market interest rates  which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares  the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry  speculation in the press or investment community  actions by institutional shareholders or hedge funds  
table of contents changes in accounting principles  terrorist acts  and general market conditions  including factors unrelated to our performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
risks associated with income tax laws the trust s failure to qualify as a reit would decrease the funds available for distribution to its shareholders and adversely affect the market price of the trust s common shares 
we believe that the trust has qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended december  the trust intends to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit  but it cannot assure shareholders that the trust will qualify as a reit 
the trust has not requested and does not plan to request a ruling from the irs that the trust qualifies as a reit  and the statements in this form k are not binding on the irs or any court 
as a reit  the trust generally will not be subject to federal income tax on its income that it distributes currently to its shareholders 
many of the reit requirements are highly technical and complex 
the determination that the trust is a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances that may not be totally within its control 
for example  to qualify as a reit  at least of our gross income must come from sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws 
the trust generally is prohibited from owning more than of the voting securities or more than of the value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer  subject to certain exceptions  including an exception with respect to certain debt instruments and corporations electing to be taxable reit subsidiaries 
the trust is also required to distribute to its shareholders at least of its reit taxable income excluding capital gains 
the fact that the trust holds most of its assets through crlp further complicates the application of the reit requirements 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize the trust s reit status 
furthermore  congress or the internal revenue service might make changes to the tax laws and regulations  or the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult  or impossible  for the trust to remain qualified as a reit 
if the trust fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  and is unable to avail itself of certain savings provisions set forth in the internal revenue code  the trust would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
as a taxable corporation  the trust would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing its taxable income or pass through long term capital gains to individual shareholders at favorable rates 
the trust also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes 
the trust would not be able to elect to be taxed as a reit for four years following the year it first failed to qualify unless the irs were to grant it relief under certain statutory provisions 
if the trust failed to qualify as a reit  it would have to pay significant income taxes  which would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to its shareholders 
this likely would have a significant adverse effect on the trust s earnings and the value of the trust s common shares and crlp s partnership units 
in addition  the trust would no longer be required to pay any distributions to shareholders and all distributions to shareholders would be taxable as ordinary c corporation dividends to the extent of the trust s current and accumulated earnings and profits 
if the trust fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and is able to avail itself of one or more of the statutory savings provisions in order to maintain its reit status  the trust would nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of at least  or more for each such failure 
moreover  the trust s failure to qualify as a reit also would cause an event of default under its credit facility and may adversely affect the trust s ability to raise capital and to service its debt 
even if the trust qualifies as a reit  it will be required to pay some taxes particularly related to the trust s taxable reit subsidiary 
even if the trust qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the trust will be required to pay certain federal  state and local taxes on its income and property 
for example  the trust will be subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than of its reit taxable income including capital gains 
moreover  if the trust has net income from prohibited transactions  that income will be subject to a tax 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale 
however  the trust will not be treated as a dealer in real property with respect to a property that it sells for the purposes of the tax if i the trust has held the property for at least two years for the production of rental income prior to the sale  ii capitalized expenditures on the property in the two years preceding the sale are less than of the net selling price of the property  and iii the trust either a has seven or fewer sales of property excluding certain property obtained through foreclosure for the year of sale or b the aggregate tax basis of property sold during the year of sale is or less of the aggregate tax basis of all of the trust s assets as of the beginning of the taxable year or c the fair market value of the property sold during the year of sale is or less of 
table of contents the aggregate fair market value of all of the trust s assets as of the beginning of the taxable year and in the case of b or c  substantially all of the marketing and development expenditures with respect to the property sold are made through an independent contractor from whom the trust derives no income 
the sale of more than one property to one buyer as part of one transaction constitutes one sale for purposes of this safe harbor 
the trust intends to hold its properties  and crlp intends to hold its properties  for investment with a view to long term appreciation  to engage in the business of acquiring  developing  owning and operating properties  and to make occasional sales of properties as are consistent with our investment objectives 
however  not all of the trust s sales will satisfy the safe harbor requirements described above 
furthermore  there are certain interpretive issues related to the application of the safe harbor that are not free from doubt under the federal income tax law 
while the trust acquires and holds properties with an investment objective and does not believe they constitute dealer property  we cannot provide any assurance that the irs might not contend that one or more of these sales are subject to the penalty tax or that the irs would not challenge our interpretation of  or any reliance on  the safe harbor provisions 
in addition  any net taxable income earned directly by the trust s taxable reit subsidiaries  or through entities that are disregarded for federal income tax purposes as entities separate from the trust s taxable reit subsidiaries  will be subject to federal and possibly state corporate income tax 
the trust has elected to treat cpsi as a taxable reit subsidiary  and it may elect to treat other subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries in the future 
in this regard  several provisions of the laws applicable to reits and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation 
for example  a taxable reit subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated reit 
in addition  the reit has to pay a penalty tax on some payments that it receives or on some deductions taken by the taxable reit subsidiaries if the economic arrangements between the reit  the reit s tenants  and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties 
finally  some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of the trust s income even though as a reit it is not subject to federal income tax on that income because not all states and localities treat reits the same as they are treated for federal income tax purposes 
to the extent that the trust and its affiliates are required to pay federal  state and local taxes  the trust will have less cash available for distributions to the trust s shareholders 
reit distribution requirements may increase our indebtedness 
the trust may be required from time to time  under certain circumstances  to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received 
in such event  or upon the trust s repayment of principal on debt  it could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit 
accordingly  the trust could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 
tax elections regarding distributions may impact our future liquidity 
under certain circumstances  the trust may make a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year 
this election may allow the trust to avoid increasing its dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year 
however  this could result in a constraint on the trust s ability to decrease its dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability

ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing our performance 
we believe that ffo is useful to investors because it provides an additional indicator of our financial and operating performance 
this is because  by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization  gains or losses from sales of properties and impairment write downs all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparison of operating performance among equity reits 
ffo is a widely recognized measure in the company s industry 
we believe that the line on our consolidated statements of operations entitled net income loss available to common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
management believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has been fundamentally beneficial  improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
on october   nareit issued updated guidance on ffo indicating that all companies should exclude impairment write downs of depreciable real estate assets when computing ffo 
previously  our calculation of ffo did not exclude impairment write downs of depreciable real estate assets 
therefore  we have changed our presentation of ffo to exclude impairment write downs of depreciable real estate assets for all periods presented 
of the years presented herein  our ffo in and was impacted by this change in presentation 
in addition to management evaluating the operating performance of its reportable segments based on ffo results  management uses ffo and ffo per share  along with other measures  to assess performance in connection with evaluating and granting incentive compensation to key employees 
our method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
ffo should not be considered a as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap  b as an indicator of financial performance  c as cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap or d as a measure of liquidity nor is it indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs  including our ability to make distributions

general we are a multifamily focused self administered equity reit that owns  operates and develops multifamily communities primarily located in the sunbelt region of the united states 
also  we create additional value for our shareholders by managing commercial assets  primarily through joint venture investments  and pursuing development opportunities 
we are a fully integrated real estate company  which means that we are engaged in the acquisition  development  ownership  management and leasing of multifamily communities and other commercial real estate properties

we conduct all of our business through crlp  cpslp  which provides management services for our properties  and cpsi  which provides management services for properties owned by third parties  including unconsolidated joint venture entities 
we perform all of our for sale residential activities through cpsi 
as a lessor  the majority of our revenue is derived from residents and tenants under existing leases at our properties 
therefore  our operating cash flow is dependent upon the rents that we are able to charge our residents and tenants  and the ability of these residents and tenants to make their rental payments 
we also receive third party management fees generated from third party management agreements related to management of properties held in joint ventures 
the trust was formed in maryland on july  the trust was reorganized as an alabama real estate investment trust in our executive offices are located at sixth avenue north  suite  birmingham  alabama  and our telephone number is business strategy and outlook during  our primary business directives were to grow the company  improve operations and achieve our balance sheet targets 
we made significant progress on each of these directives as outlined below 

table of contents grow the company we continued to grow the company and improve our portfolio in we sold six wholly owned multifamily apartment communities  representing  units  and two wholly owned commercial assets for approximately million and our interests in two commercial joint ventures for proceeds of approximately million 
we reinvested that capital into eight multifamily apartment communities located in austin and dallas  texas  charlotte and raleigh  north carolina  charleston  south carolina  gulf shores  alabama and las vegas  nevada 
we continued the development of colonial grand at hampton preserve  located in tampa  florida  and started construction on two additional apartment community developments  colonial grand at double creek  located in austin  texas  and colonial grand at lake mary phase i  located in orlando florida 
these eight acquisitions added  units to our multifamily portfolio and the three developments are expected to add  units once completed 
improve operations favorable supply demand dynamics led to strong momentum in the multifamily business during for the year ended december   our multifamily same property revenue increased while expenses increased and same property net operating income noi grew  each when compared to the prior year see note to the trust s and crlp s consolidated financial statements segment information 
this improvement in operations was led by rental rate growth increasing from per unit in to per unit in for our same property portfolio  consistently high occupancy levels and strong expense controls 
achieving balance sheet targets we continued to reduce our leverage by issuing common equity through two continuous equity offering programs and selectively disposing of non income producing assets  extended our debt maturities with a new senior unsecured term loan  and improved our fixed charge ratio with the repurchase of our remaining preferred securities 
our transactions in include the following issued  common shares under two at the market equity offering programs at an average issue price of per share  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million  closed on a million senior unsecured term loan with a maturity date of august  and an interest rate fixed at through maturity based on the initial margin through two interest rate swaps  repurchased crlp s remaining outstanding series b cumulative redeemable preferred units the series b preferred units  and sold million of various undeveloped land parcels 
we are expecting the momentum that we experienced in to carry into as such  our business directives for are similar to in  our primary business directives are to grow the company  improve our portfolio and continue efforts to maintain a strong balance sheet and improved margins to help re establish an investment grade rating 
we will look to grow the company by improving operations in our multifamily portfolio and by developing multifamily apartment communities on land that we already own or on new sites in our sunbelt markets 
in addition  we may selectively acquire newer multifamily apartment communities that are attractively priced in our sunbelt markets 
we will look to improve our portfolio by recycling older multifamily apartment communities  as well as several commercial assets  in exchange for younger multifamily assets in top quartile sunbelt markets

liquidity and capital resources as noted above  except as otherwise required by the context  references to the company  we  us and our refer to the trust and crlp together  as well as crlp s subsidiaries 
unless otherwise specified below  the following discussion of liquidity and capital resources applies to both the trust and crlp 
short term liquidity needs we believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund operating expenses directly associated with our portfolio of properties including regular maintenance items  capital expenditures incurred to lease our multifamily apartment communities and commercial space eg  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding debt  and quarterly distributions that we pay to the trust s shareholders and holders of partnership units in crlp 
with million of debt maturing in including amounts outstanding under our unsecured credit facility as of december  and million of our pro rata share of unconsolidated debt  we believe that cash generated from operations  dispositions of assets and additional borrowings will be sufficient to allow us to execute our previously discussed business directives and meet our short term liquidity requirements 
however  factors described below and elsewhere herein may have a material adverse effect on our future cash flow 
we currently expect to refinance our existing unsecured credit facility or enter into a new credit facility prior to its maturity on june  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in refinancing or replacing our credit facility or that the financial terms or covenants of any refinanced or new facility will be the same or as favorable as those under our existing credit facility 
see item a in our form k risk factors risks associated with our indebtedness and financing activities we depend on external sources of capital that are outside of our control  which may affect our ability to pursue strategic opportunities  satisfy our debt obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 
our cash flows from operations  financing activities and investing activities including dispositions  as well as general economic and market conditions  are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources 
changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities are as follows operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable prior year period 
the change was primarily driven by an increase in operating performance at our same property multifamily apartment communities  gains recognized on the disposition of assets and the timing of property tax payments relating to accrued expenses 
this increase was partially offset by million of tax refunds received during the year ended december  for  we expect cash flows from operating activities to be higher than in due to acquisitions and developments placed into service in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
the change is primarily the result of increased acquisition activity in  partially offset by proceeds from dispositions and a reduction in capital expenditures in when compared to the same period in the prior year 
as we continue to explore growth through potential acquisitions and developments  we expect our cash flow used in investing activities to increase in  compared to financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash used in financing activities of million for the comparable prior year period 
in  we issued a new senior unsecured term loan of million  which was offset by payments on outstanding borrowings under our unsecured credit facility  and used million of funds to repurchase the remaining outstanding series b preferred units 
table of contents of crlp 
in addition  in  we had a decrease in cash used for unsecured senior note maturity payments repurchases when compared to in  we used million of funds to redeem the series d preferred depositary shares and million of funds to repurchase of crlp s outstanding series b preferred units  and received new secured financings of million 
the majority of our revenue is derived from residents and tenants under existing leases  primarily at our multifamily apartment communities 
therefore  our operating cash flow is dependent upon i the number of multifamily apartment communities in our portfolio  ii rental rates  iii occupancy rates  iv operating expenses associated with these apartment communities and v the ability of residents to make their rental payments 
weakness in the economy and job market in the us since had adversely affected rents we are able to charge and thereby adversely affected our operating cash flows 
however  in the last half of and in  revenues from our same property multifamily communities were positive when compared to the same periods in prior years 
we are continuing to see some improvements in the multifamily fundamentals  such as higher occupancy rates  positive new and renewal lease rates over the expiring leases  a declining homeownership rate and a decline in turnover  which all are positive developments for the multifamily industry 
we have made an election to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  commencing with our taxable year ended december  if we maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our distributed net income if we distribute at least of our reit taxable income to the trust s shareholders 
even if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income 
long term liquidity needs we believe our principal long term liquidity needs are to fund the principal amount of our long term debt as it matures  significant capital expenditures that need to be made at our properties  development projects that we undertake  and costs associated with acquisitions of properties that we pursue 
historically  we have satisfied these requirements principally through the most advantageous source of capital at the time  which has included the incurrence of new debt through borrowings by crlp through public offerings of unsecured debt and private incurrence of collateralized and unsecured debt  sales of common shares of the trust including through at the market equity offering programs  sales of preferred shares of the trust  capital raised through the disposition of assets and joint venture capital transactions 
on may   the trust and crlp filed a joint universal shelf registration statement with the sec allowing the trust to offer  from time to time  an unspecified amount of equity securities of the trust including common and preferred shares and allowing crlp to offer  from time to time  an unspecified amount of debt securities  each on an as needed basis subject to the ability of the trust and crlp to effect offerings on satisfactory terms based on prevailing conditions 
in  the trust sold  common shares under its december and may continuous at the market equity offering programs at a weighted average issuance price of per share for net proceeds of approximately million 
pursuant to crlp s fourth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership  each time the trust issues common shares pursuant to the foregoing programs or other equity offerings  crlp issues to the trust  its general partner  an equal number of units for the same price at which the common shares were sold and the trust contributes the net proceeds of such offerings to crlp 
the net proceeds resulting from these two offering programs were used to pay down a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our unsecured credit facility  to partially fund the acquisition of three multifamily properties and to fund other general corporate purposes see note to the trust s and crlp s consolidated financial statements real estate activity acquisition activity 
the december at the market equity offering program was fully exhausted in april and the may at the market equity offering program was fully exhausted in july our ability to raise funds through sales of common shares and preferred shares of the trust and debt securities of crlp in the future is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reit s  market perceptions about our company and the current trading price of the trust s common shares 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but the equity and credit markets may not be consistently available on terms that are attractive or at all 
our ability to incur additional debt and the cost of incurring additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our credit ratings  the value of our assets  our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by our current lenders 
we will continue to monitor the unsecured and secured debt markets  and as market conditions permit  access 
table of contents borrowings that are advantageous to us 
our ability to generate cash from asset sales is limited by market conditions and certain rules applicable to reits 
we may not be able to sell a property or properties as quickly as we have in the past or on terms as favorable as we have previously received 
during the year ended december   we sold assets or our interests in assets for aggregate proceeds of approximately million million from the sale of consolidated assets  including land parcels and for sale residential assets  and million  which is our pro rata share  from the sale of unconsolidated assets and from dispositions of our joint venture interests in the underlying assets 
the proceeds from these asset sales were used to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
at december   our total outstanding debt balance was billion 
the outstanding balance includes fixed rate debt of billion  or of the total debt balance  and floating rate debt of million  or of the total debt balance

the credit facility and cash management line  which have been primarily used to finance property acquisitions and developments  and periodically to also fund repurchases of crlp senior notes and preferred shares and units  had outstanding balances at december  of million and none  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate of the credit facility  including the cash management line  was at december  the credit facility contains various ratios and covenants that are more fully described in note financing activities unsecured revolving credit facility in the notes to consolidated financial statements of the trust and crlp  included in item of this form k

we expect to be able to comply with these ratios and covenants in  but no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain compliance with these ratios and other debt covenants

table of contents with our indebtedness and financing activities we depend on external sources of capital that are outside of our control  which may affect our ability to pursue strategic opportunities  satisfy our debt obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 
distributions on january   a cash distribution was declared to shareholders of the trust in the amount of per common share and to partners of crlp in the amount of per common unit  totaling approximately million 
the per common share and per common unit distribution represents a increase per share unit when compared to the previous distribution 
the distribution was declared to shareholders and partners of record as of february  and will be paid on february  we also pay regular quarterly distributions on preferred units in crlp  to the extent outstanding 
as of december   all remaining preferred units in crlp had been repurchased 
the maintenance of these distributions is subject to various factors  including the discretion of the trust s board of trustees  the trust s ability to pay dividends under alabama law  the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of reit distribution requirements  which require at least of the trust s taxable income to be distributed to the trust s shareholders excluding net capital gains

market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes that could affect our results of operations and financial condition or cash flow 
we limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures  including the use of derivative instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risk 
however  interest rate swap agreements and other hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks  including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations 
developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes at december  estimated fair in thousands thereafter total value fixed rate debt average interest rate at december  variable rate debt average interest rate at december  represents amount outstanding under our credit facility as of december   which matures on june  the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  it does not consider those exposures or positions  which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time  and interest rates 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding variable rate debt 
we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by our variable rate debt is material in relation to our billion of outstanding total debt and our billion of total assets as of december  if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase by  the increase in annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under our variable rate debt remains approximately million  the balance as of december  our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
to accomplish this objective  we primarily use interest rate swaps and caps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount 
interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an upfront premium 

table of contents on june   we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement to hedge the interest rate risk associated with forecasted debt issuance 
this interest rate swap agreement has a notional amount of million  a fixed interest rate of  and a maturity date of august  on july   we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement to hedge the interest rate risk associated with forecasted debt issuance 
this interest rate swap agreement has a notional amount of million  a fixed interest rate of  and a maturity date of august  these interest rate swaps became effective on july  when we entered into a new million term loan  as discussed above 
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings as interest expense as interest payments are made on our variable rate debt 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings as a loss on hedging activities 
during the years ended december  and  we accelerated the reclassification of amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss to loss on hedging activities related to interest payments on the hedged debt were deemed probable not to occur as a result of the repurchases of senior notes of crlp 
the accelerated amounts were a loss of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we did not reclassify amounts to loss on hedging activities for the year ended december  amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our variable rate debt 
the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss for reclassifications to interest expense tied to interest payments on the hedged debt were million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
over the next twelve months  the company expects to reclassify million from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an increase to interest expense 
as of december   the company had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk interest rate derivative number of instruments notional amount in thousands interest rate swaps further  we have a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  we have not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor do we anticipate any material adverse effect on our net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives

as a result of transactions executed in  we implemented our strategic initiative to become a multifamily focused reit  which included two significant joint venture transactions whereby the majority of our wholly owned commercial properties were transferred into separate joint ventures 
in december  we disposed of our interest in one of these joint ventures but continue to retain an interest in the other joint venture

at december   the total amount of debt of the joint venture  which matures on january   was approximately million 
at december   no liability was recorded for the guarantee 
in connection with certain retail developments  we have received funding from municipalities for infrastructure costs 
in most cases  the municipalities issue bonds that are repaid primarily from sales tax revenues generated from the tenants at each respective development 
we have guaranteed the shortfall  if any  of tax revenues to the debt service requirements on the bonds issued for our colonial promenade tannehill development  which had approximately million outstanding at december  at december   no liability was recorded for the guarantee

summary of critical accounting policies we believe our accounting policies are in conformity with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements

recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the asset s fair value 
assets classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we determine fair value based on inputs management believes are consistent with those other market participants would use 
the fair values of these assets are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques  including i discounted cash flow analysis  which considers  among other things  unit sales assumptions  leasing assumptions  cost structure  growth rates  discount rates and terminal capitalization rates  ii income capitalization approach  which considers prevailing market capitalization rates and iii comparable sales activity 
the valuation technique and related inputs vary with the specific facts and circumstances of each project 
estimates are significantly impacted by estimates of sales price  selling velocity  sales incentives  construction costs and other factors 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  actual results could differ from such estimates 
for those assets deemed to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is to be measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  as follows useful lives buildings years furniture  fixtures and equipment years land improvements or years tenant improvements life of lease repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred 
replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets 
cost capitalization costs incurred during pre development are capitalized after we have identified a development site  determined that a project is feasible and concluded that it is probable that the project will proceed 
while we believe we will recover this capital through the successful development of such projects  it is possible that a write off of unrecoverable amounts could occur 
once it is no longer probable that a development will be successful  the pre development costs that have been previously capitalized are expensed 
the capitalization of costs during the development of assets including interest  property taxes and other direct costs begins when an active development commences and ends when the asset  or a portion of an asset  is delivered and is ready for its intended use 
cost capitalization during redevelopment of assets including interest and other direct costs begins when the 
table of contents asset is taken out of service for redevelopment and ends when the asset redevelopment is completed and the asset is placed in service 
acquisition of real estate assets we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with asc  business combinations  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and tenant improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases and value of other tenant relationships  based in each case on the fair values 
we allocate purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes the land and building determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant 
the as if vacant value is allocated to land and buildings based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets 
we also allocate value to tenant improvements based on the estimated costs of similar tenants with similar terms 
we record acquired intangible assets including above market leases  customer relationships and in place leases and acquired intangible liabilities including below market leases at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill 
we amortize identified intangible assets and liabilities that are determined to have finite lives over the period the assets and liabilities are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired 
intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 
inflation leases at our multifamily properties generally provide for an initial term of six months to one year and allow for rent adjustments at the time of renewal 
leases at our office properties typically provide for rent adjustments and the pass through of certain operating expenses during the term of the lease 
substantially all of the leases at our retail properties provide for the pass through to tenants of certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  common area maintenance expenses  and insurance 
all of these provisions permit us to increase rental rates or other charges to tenants in response to rising prices and  therefore  serve to minimize our exposure to the adverse effects of inflation 
an increase in general price levels may immediately precede  or accompany  an increase in interest rates 
at december   our exposure to rising interest rates was mitigated by our high percentage of consolidated fixed rate debt 
as it relates to the short term  an increase in interest expense resulting from increasing inflation is anticipated to be less than future increases in income before interest 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  means income loss before noncontrolling interest determined in accordance with gaap  excluding sales of depreciated property and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate  plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing our performance 
we believe that ffo is useful to investors because it provides an additional indicator of our financial and operating performance 
this is because  by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization  gains or losses from sales of properties and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparison of operating performance among equity reits 
ffo is a widely recognized measure in the company s industry 
we believe that the line item on our consolidated statements of operations entitled net income loss available to common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
management believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has been fundamentally beneficial  improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
on october   nareit issued updated guidance on ffo indicating that all companies should exclude impairment write downs of depreciable real estate assets when computing ffo 
previously  our calculation of ffo did not exclude 
table of contents impairment write downs of depreciable real estate assets 
therefore  we have changed our presentation of ffo to exclude impairment write downs of depreciable real estate assets for all periods presented 
of the years presented herein  our ffo in and was impacted by this change in presentation 
in addition to management evaluating the operating performance of our reportable segments based on ffo results  management uses ffo and ffo per share  along with other measures  to assess performance in connection with evaluating and granting incentive compensation to key employees 
our method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of financial performance  as cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity nor is it indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs  including our ability to make distributions 
the following information is provided to reconcile net income available to common shareholders of the trust  the most comparable gaap measure  to ffo  and to show the items included in our ffo for the years ended december     and years ended december  in thousands  except per share and unit data net loss income available to common shareholders adjustments consolidated noncontrolling interest in crlp noncontrolling interest in gain on sale of undepreciated property real estate depreciation real estate amortization impairment on depreciable assets consolidated gains losses from sales of property  net of income tax and noncontrolling interest gains losses from sales of undepreciated property  net of income tax and noncontrolling interest adjustments unconsolidated subsidiaries real estate depreciation real estate amortization gains from sales of property funds from operations income allocated to participating securities funds from operations available to common shareholders and unitholders funds from operations per share and unit basic funds from operations per share and unit diluted weighted average common shares outstanding basic weighted average partnership units outstanding basic
