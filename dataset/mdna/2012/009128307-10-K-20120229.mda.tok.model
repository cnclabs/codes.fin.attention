item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
this report  including the information incorporated by reference  contains forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the use of any of the words believe  expect  anticipate  plan  estimate  and similar expressions are intended to identify such statements 
forward looking statements include statements concerning the integration of omniflight  our possible or assumed future results  flight volume and collection rates for cbs operations  size  structure and growth of our air medical services and products markets  continuation and or renewal of hbs contracts  acquisition of new and profitable ur division contracts  and other matters 
the actual results that we achieve may differ materially from those discussed in such forward looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties described in the risk factors contained in part i  item a of this report  in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in other sections of this report  as well as in our quarterly reports on form q 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
overview we provide air medical transportation services throughout the united states and design  manufacture  and install medical aircraft interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products 
our divisions  or business segments  are organized according to the type of service or product provided and consist of the following community based services cbs provides air medical transportation services to the general population as an independent service 
revenue consists of flight fees billed directly to patients  their insurers  or governmental agencies  and cash flow is dependent upon collection from these individuals or entities 
in the cbs division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in hospital based services hbs provides air medical transportation services to hospitals throughout the us under exclusive operating agreements 
revenue consists primarily of fixed monthly fees approximately of total contract revenue and hourly flight fees approximately of total contract revenue billed to hospital customers 
in the hbs division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in united rotorcraft ur division designs  manufactures  and installs aircraft medical interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products for domestic and international customers 
in the ur division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for operating results by segment 
we believe that the following factors have the greatest impact on our results of operations and financial condition flight volume 
fluctuations in flight volume have a greater impact on cbs operations than hbs operations because almost all of cbs revenue is derived from flight fees  as compared to approximately of hbs revenue 
by contrast  of our costs primarily associated with flight operations including salaries  aircraft ownership costs  hull insurance  and general and administrative expenses incurred during the year ended december   are mainly fixed in nature 
while flight volume is affected by many factors  including competition and the effectiveness of marketing and business development initiatives  the greatest single variable has historically been weather conditions 
adverse weather conditions such as fog  high winds  or heavy precipitation hamper our ability to operate our aircraft safely and  therefore  result in reduced flight volume 
total patient transports for cbs operations were approximately  for compared to approximately  for patient transports for cbs bases open longer than one year and excluding transports for omniflight bases same base transports  were approximately  in compared to  in cancellations due to unfavorable weather conditions for cbs bases open longer than one year were higher in compared to requests for community based services decreased by for the year ended december   for bases open greater than one year 

table of contents reimbursement per transport 
we respond to calls for air medical transports without pre screening the creditworthiness of the patient and are subject to collection risk for services provided to insured and uninsured patients 
medicare and medicaid also receive contractual discounts from our standard charges for flight services 
flight revenue is recorded net of provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care 
both provisions are estimated during the period the related services are performed based on historical collection experience and any known trends or changes in reimbursement rate schedules and payer mix 
the provisions are adjusted as required based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
net reimbursement per transport for cbs operations is primarily a function of price  payer mix  and timely and effective collection efforts 
both the pace of collections and the ultimate collection rate are affected by the overall health of the us economy  which impacts the number of indigent patients and funding for state run programs  such as medicaid 
medicaid reimbursement rates in many jurisdictions have remained well below the cost of providing air medical transportation 
in addition  the collection rate is impacted by changes in the cost of healthcare and health insurance  as the cost of healthcare increases  health insurance coverage provided by employers may be reduced or eliminated entirely  resulting in an increase in the uninsured population 
most of the significant provisions of ppaca have yet to take effect and portions of the act have been challenged in the supreme court 
net reimbursement per transport increased in the year ended december   compared to  attributed to recent price increases 
provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care as a percentage of related gross billings for cbs operations were as follows for years ended december  gross billings provision for contractual discounts provision for uncompensated care although price increases generally increase the net reimbursement per transport from insurance payers  the amount per transport collectible from private patient payers  medicare  and medicaid does not increase proportionately with price increases 
therefore  depending upon overall payer mix  price increases will usually result in an increase in the percentage of uncollectible accounts 
although we have not yet experienced significant increased limitations in the amount reimbursed by insurance companies  continued price increases may cause insurance companies to limit coverage for air medical transport to amounts less than our standard rates 
the increase in the percentage of uncollectible accounts in also reflects the addition of omniflight which had a higher gross charge structure and  therefore  a higher percentage of uncollectible accounts 
in addition  the percentage of transports covered by insurance for omniflight s cbs operations has historically been approximately three to four percentage points lower than the percentage of insured transports for the company s historical operations 
aircraft maintenance 
both cbs and hbs operations are directly affected by fluctuations in aircraft maintenance costs 
proper operation of the aircraft by flight crews and standardized maintenance practices can help to contain maintenance costs 
increases in spare parts prices from original equipment manufacturers tend to be higher for aircraft which are no longer in production 
two models of aircraft within our fleet  representing of the rotor wing fleet  are no longer in production and are  therefore  susceptible to price increases which outpace general inflationary trends 
in addition  on condition components are more likely to require replacement with age 
since january   we have taken delivery of new aircraft and expect to take delivery of a total of six additional aircraft during we have replaced discontinued models and other older aircraft with the new aircraft  as well as provided capacity for base expansion 
replacement models of aircraft typically have higher ownership costs than the models targeted for replacement but lower maintenance costs 
total maintenance expense for cbs and hbs operations increased from the year ended december   to the year ended december   while total flight volume for cbs and hbs operations increased over the same period 
the change in maintenance expense reflects normal fluctuations in the timing of overhaul and replacement cycles for aircraft parts 
in addition  during we became qualified to bring repairs and overhauls of certain aircraft engines in house  resulting in a decrease of approximately in the repair costs associated with this engine type 

table of contents competitive pressures from low cost providers 
we are recognized within the industry for our standard of service and our use of cabin class aircraft 
many of our competitors utilize aircraft with lower ownership and operating costs and do not require a similar level of experience for aviation and medical personnel 
reimbursement rates established by medicare  medicaid  and most insurance providers are not contingent upon the type of aircraft used or the experience of personnel 
however  we believe that higher quality standards help to differentiate our service from competitors and  therefore  lead to higher utilization 
employee recruitment and relations 
the ability to deliver quality services is partially dependent upon our ability to hire and retain employees who have advanced aviation  nursing  and other technical skills 
in addition  hospital contracts typically contain minimum certification requirements for pilots and mechanics 
after over two and a half years since the expiration of the previous cba  we completed negotiations on a new two year cba in december wage increases stipulated in the new cba are consistent with our expectations of increases for other work groups during the next two years 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded  for retroactive adjustments in pay resulting from the new cba 
other employee groups may also elect to be represented by unions in the future

increase of approximately  for the year ended december   for the addition of personnel to staff new base locations described above 
increases in salaries for merit pay raises and in the cost of employee medical benefits 
aircraft operating expenses increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to aircraft operating expenses consist of fuel  insurance  and maintenance costs and generally are a function of the size of the fleet  the type of aircraft flown  and the number of hours flown 
the increase in costs is due to the following increase in aircraft maintenance expense of  or  to  total flight volume for cbs and hbs operations increased for compared to excluding the impact of the omniflight fleet  aircraft maintenance expense decreased for compared to  and total flight volume for cbs and hbs operations  excluding the omniflight fleet  increased 
the decrease in maintenance expense reflects normal fluctuations in the timing of overhaul and replacement cycles for aircraft parts 
in addition  during we became qualified to bring repairs and overhauls of certain aircraft engines in house  resulting in a decrease of approximately in the repair costs associated with this engine type 
increase of approximately in the cost of aircraft fuel per hour flown 
total fuel costs increased  to  for compared to during both and we had commodity call options to protect against aircraft fuel price increases greater than  covering essentially all of our fuel consumption for  excluding the impact of the omniflight fleet  and approximately of our consumption in fuel expense included non cash mark to market derivative losses of  for compared to  for cash settlements under the terms of the agreements totaled  in we received no cash settlements under the agreements in decreases in hull insurance rates effective july and total aircraft operating expenses related to the omniflight fleet were approximately  from the acquisition date through december

we also incurred approximately  in expenses related to transitioning omniflight s g a functions into existing air methods departments 
the increase in expense also reflects additional headcount in our safety department to support the ongoing implementation of our safety management system sms and in our billing  dispatch  and transfer center departments to support the increase in third party contracts 
interest expense increased  or  for the year ended december   compared to the increase is primarily due to interest of  recorded on capital lease obligations assumed in the omniflight acquisition and to interest incurred on the million term loan originated to fund the acquisition of omniflight 
the term loan bears interest at a variable rate which averaged from inception through december  in addition  we carried an average balance of million against our line of credit during the fourth quarter of  compared to no borrowings against our line in these increases were partially offset by the effect of the reduction in principal balances for long term debt and capital lease obligations as a result of regularly scheduled payments

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash requirements debt and other long term obligations the following table outlines our contractual obligations as of december  amounts in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt principal interest payments total long term debt obligations capital leases interest payments total capital lease obligations operating leases aircraft purchase commitments total interest payments include an estimate of variable rate interest on our revolving credit facility and notes with principal balances of  as of december  variable interest was estimated using the weighted average rate in effect during for each note and the average balance outstanding against the revolving credit facility during the fourth quarter of we did not carry a balance on our line of credit in prior to the fourth quarter 
balloon payments on long term debt are due as follows  in  in  in  in  in  in off balance sheet arrangements aircraft purchase commitments as of december   we had open purchase commitments for aircraft scheduled to be delivered in and during  we took delivery of aircraft as scheduled under these commitments 
the remaining ten aircraft  representing a total purchase commitment of million  were scheduled for delivery in in the first quarter of  we canceled delivery of four aircraft with a value of million under this commitment 
typically we have financed aircraft acquired under similar commitments through capital lease or debt agreements 
if financing arrangements cannot be arranged or we are prevented from taking or decline to take delivery of the remaining six aircraft under the commitments described above for any other reason  we may forfeit nonrefundable deposits of approximately million 
the amount of deposit to be forfeited may be mitigated if the aircraft manufacturer is able to remarket the commitment positions 
as of december   we have received financing commitments  subject to routine credit approval and aircraft inspection processes  to cover the cost of all aircraft scheduled to be delivered in we intend to use the new aircraft for base expansion opportunities as well as to replace older models of aircraft in the fleet 
we plan to either sell the aircraft which are replaced  use them for spare parts  or redeploy them into the backup fleet 

table of contents residual value guarantees we have entered into various aircraft leases under which we provide residual value guarantees to the lessor 
as of december   the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments under the guarantees is  all of which relates to aircraft leases assumed in the fss and omniflight acquisitions 
no amounts related to the guarantees were included in the minimum lease payments for purposes of measuring capital lease obligations  since it is not probable that the residual value of the aircraft will be less than the amounts stipulated in the guarantee 
the assessment of whether it is probable that we will be required to make payments under the terms of the guarantee is based on current market data and our actual and expected loss experience 
letters of credit in january  we entered into a  letter of credit with an insurance underwriter in lieu of increasing cash deposits on our workers compensation insurance policy 
in april  we entered into a  letter of credit with a county government in california as performance security under an exclusive operating agreement 
prior to our acquisition  omniflight had entered into six letters of credit totaling  to support aircraft lease obligations and credit terms extended by other vendors 
as required by the underlying lease and credit agreements  we renewed or assumed all six letters of credit following our acquisition in august all letters of credit may be renewed annually 
six of the letters of credit described above totaling  reduce the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility

we are required to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the credit facility and other notes 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  deferred income taxes  and valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition fixed flight fee revenue under our operating agreements with hospitals is recognized monthly over the terms of the agreements 
flight revenue relating to patient transports is recognized upon completion of the services and is recorded net of provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care 
both provisions are estimated during the period the related services are performed based on historical collection experience and any known trends or changes in reimbursement rate schedules and payer mix 
the provisions are adjusted as required based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
we have from time to time experienced delays in reimbursement from third party payers 
in addition  third party payers may disallow  in whole or in part  claims for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not reimbursable under plan coverage  determinations of medical necessity  or the need for additional information 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are very complex and subject to interpretation 
we also provide services to patients who have no insurance or other third party payer coverage 
there can be no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same collection rates that we have in the past 
if actual future collections are more or less than those projected by management  adjustments to allowances for contractual discounts and uncompensated care may be required 
based on related flight revenue for the year ended december   a change of basis points in the percentage of estimated contractual discounts and uncompensated care would have resulted in a change of approximately  in flight revenue 

table of contents revenue related to fixed fee medical interior and products contracts is recorded as costs are incurred using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of an estimate of the total costs to complete the project 
losses on contracts in process are recognized when determined 
if total costs to complete a project are greater or less than estimated  the gross margin on the project may be greater or less than originally recorded under the percentage of completion method 
deferred income taxes in preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciable assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income and record a valuation allowance for those amounts we believe are not likely to be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance in a period increases income tax expense 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in statutory tax rates applicable to the company is also recognized in income in the period of the change 
we evaluate the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position and applicable tax law and other tax pronouncements 
changes in our estimates of uncertain tax positions would be recognized as an adjustment to income tax expense in the period of the change 
long lived assets valuation in accounting for long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
estimates of useful lives and residual values of aircraft are based upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted for estimated current industry trends  the economy  and operating conditions 

table of contents goodwill valuation the company s goodwill relates to six acquisitions and has been allocated to our operating segments 
annually  at december  the company evaluates goodwill for potential impairment using a two step test at the reporting unit level 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the book value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  with its fair value 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recorded 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the book value of the goodwill 
the amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit based upon the reporting unit s historical operating profit and the company s current public trading value 
estimated future operating profit for each reporting unit is also taken into consideration when determining the reporting unit s fair value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of economic changes and to estimate future operating profit for the reporting units 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and patient receivable collection rates  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts 
changes in these estimates or a continued decline in general economic conditions could change our conclusion regarding an impairment of goodwill and potentially result in a non cash impairment loss in a future period 
the estimated fair values of the reporting units have historically exceeded the carrying values of the reporting units 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on the company s public trading value and on each reporting unit s historical and estimated future operating profits 
based on the amounts used in the evaluation of goodwill at december   either the company s current public trading value or any reporting unit s operating profit would have to decrease by more than before the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
new accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
some amendments clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and others change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the asu is effective for periods beginning after december  we do not expect the implementation of asu no 
to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation and disclosure of patient service revenue  provision for bad debts  and the allowance for doubtful accounts for certain health care entities  requiring health care entities that recognize significant amounts of patient service revenue to present the provision for bad debts related to patient service revenue as a deduction from patient service revenue net of contractual allowances and discounts on their statements of operations 
the asu also requires enhanced disclosures about revenue recognition and bad debt assessment policies related to patient service revenue
