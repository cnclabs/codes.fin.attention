item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an international oil and gas exploration and production company focused on south america  with operations in argentina and colombia 
as of december   we had interests in eight oil and gas producing concessions and two exploration permits in argentina  and three exploration and production contracts in colombia 
our interests in argentina continue to be the core of our business  and we continually seek out properties in argentina s basins where we have expertise 
we also believe that colombia offers outstanding opportunities to add properties with excellent technical and economic characteristics to our portfolio 
we consider the investment and promotional climate and the oil and gas tax regime created by the colombian government over the last several years to be the most attractive in south america 
we are encouraged by the improved commodity price environment in argentina 
we believe higher prices are necessary to stimulate and encourage both conventional and unconventional exploration activity to help supply the growing energy needs of the country 
however  inflation in argentina has been a persistent problem for several years and  with only a modest devaluation of the argentine peso in comparison to inflation rates  we have experienced significant increases in our us dollar cost of operations and capital expenditures 
consequently  our operating income in did not increase in line with the upward trend of our oil price realizations 
net income attributable to apco for was million compared with million for higher average sales prices  greater equity income from argentine investment and lower exploration expense in led to the increase in net income compared with these favorable variances were partially offset by greater costs and operating expenses 
our capital expenditures totaled million in highlights for include the following increased total consolidated and equity sales volumes on a boe basis by four percent  successful development and exploration drilling campaigns in our core neuqu n basin properties  exploration discoveries in the bajada del palo concession  exploration discovery in the agua amarga exploration permit  and exploration discoveries  completion of farm in drilling commitments and extension of the coir n amargo exploration permit 
outlook for we expect oil prices in argentina to increase moderately in compared with year end prices of around per barrel 
after experiencing permitting delays in  exploration drilling in colombia will commence in the first quarter with drilling in colombia and development efforts beginning in coir n amargo  we plan on increased capital expenditures compared with our primary objectives for are as follows obtain the ten year concession extensions for our properties in r o negro and tierra del fuego  continue development of existing fields and conventional exploration drilling in our core properties in the neuqu n basin  investigate the productive potential of the vaca muerta and molles shales in our properties in the neuqu n basin  
table of contents commence development drilling and continue exploration efforts in coir n amargo  and complete d seismic acquisitions in sur r o deseado este in southern argentina and over the llanos block in colombia 
our oil and gas capital expenditure budget is million 
after taking into consideration the portion of capital expenditures attributable to our equity interest in petrolera  our combined consolidated and equity capital budget for is million 
in addition  we plan on spending approximately million for the acquisition of d seismic information 
for further discussion about funding our capital budget  see md a liquidity and capital resources 
overview of change in control separation from williams in february  our previous major shareholder  williams  announced a reorganization plan to separate williams into two standalone  publicly traded corporations 
the plan called for the separation of williams exploration and production business  of which we were a part  via a spin off to williams shareholders of a corporation that would hold that business  wpx energy 
because we are an oil and gas exploration and production company and used the personnel and resources of williams exploration and production business  williams decided to transfer its entire interest in apco to wpx energy 
our transfer to wpx energy enables us to continue to benefit from the exploration and production expertise  personnel and experience that has historically been provided to us by williams 
effective december   all of the common stock of wpx energy was distributed to the stockholders of williams the spin off and wpx energy became a publicly owned company 
after the spin off  williams does not own any of our equity securities 
wpx energy is a large scale  independent exploration and production company with operations primarily in north america 
neuqu n basin properties we and our partners used two rigs throughout to drill gross development wells and five exploration wells in the entre lomas  bajada del palo  charco del palenque and agua amarga areas 
total gross capital expenditures was approximately million for the year  or million net to our percent direct working interest and million attributable to our equity interest in petrolera 
we have a percent direct working interest and an effective percent equity interest in the wells mentioned above 
the western most portion of our bajada del palo concession is known as aguada del poncho 
like the southern portion of our coir n amargo permit  aguada del poncho is situated in the deepest portion of the neuqu n basin near ypf s loma de la lata concession 
during  we drilled two successful exploration wells in this area and re entered an existing well with positive results 
all three of these wells are on production 
additional activities included exploration efforts to stimulate production from the vaca muerta shale in three existing wells in the bajada del palo and entre lomas concessions 
the vaca muerta formation was not productive in these wells 
all costs associated with these three well re entries have been expensed as exploration costs during we will re enter another existing well in the bajada del palo concession and perform a significantly larger fracture of the vaca muerta shale in first quarter in our agua amarga exploration permit  we drilled the meseta filosa x exploration well in the central part of the area which resulted in an oil discovery from the tordillo formation 
as a result of this discovery  the charco del palenque exploitation concession was extended by  acres 

table of contents coir n amargo the coir n amargo block covers approximately  acres and is adjacent to our core properties in the neuqu n basin 
during  we drilled two wells and completed our commitments to earn a percent interest in the block 
both wells resulted in oil discoveries in the tordillo formation 
in december  we commenced a multi stage fracture stimulation of the vaca muerta formation in one of the vertical wells drilled earlier in the year 
this well is being tested in the first quarter of we also spudded a third well targeting both the tordillo and vaca muerta formations in december 
since entering our farm in agreement in early  we have drilled four wells resulting in hydrocarbon discoveries 
this achievement is a continuation of our success during recent years where we have used an established geologic model to drill exploration wells in our core properties in the neuqu n basin 
the current exploration period expired in november we have agreed with the province to convert  gross acres into an exploitation concession with a term of years  and the remaining portion of the block has been deemed a high risk exploration area that will require exploration commitments of approximately million net to apco during and to investigate unconventional potential in the block 
after the two year extension of the exploration period  we will determine how much of the remaining area will be converted to an exploitation concession and how much acreage  if any  will have to be relinquished 
concession contracts in argentina the concession terms for the portion of the entre lomas concession located in r o negro and for our tierra del fuego concessions currently end in approximately one half of the entre lomas concession  including our largest producing field  is located in the province of r o negro 
in general  the depletion life of many of our proved wells extends beyond and through the end of the concession extension period  and consequently  obtaining the ten year extension should lead to reserve upgrades that will result in a material increase in the volume of proved reserves 
in the second half of  the provinces of r o negro and tierra del fuego approved basic frameworks for the negotiation of the ten year concession extensions provided by argentina s hydrocarbon law 
the operators of the concessions are leading negotiations with the provinces on behalf of the joint venture partners  and significant advances were made with both provinces during similar to the negotiations concluded with the province of neuqu n in  the requirements for extension include the negotiation of a cash bonus payment  an increase to provincial production taxes  and a future expenditure program 
although we expected to conclude these negotiations in  federal and provincial elections throughout the year postponed the approval of any final extension agreement to colombia after completing seismic programs in both the turpial and llanos blocks in colombia during  our plans were to commence exploration drilling in both blocks during however  our drilling plans have been deferred to because of considerable government delays to issue environmental and drilling permits as a result of the high levels of exploration activity in colombia 
we received our drilling permit for the llanos block in the third quarter  and expect to receive our permit for turpial in early because the exploration period in the turpial block expired in september  we requested and received a six month contract extension effective from the date of receiving the permit as a result of the permitting delays 
the drilling location for our first well in llanos is being constructed and we are scheduled to spud the well in february in early  we commenced the acquisition of square kilometers of d seismic over our llanos block estimated to cost million net to our percent interest 

table of contents oil and natural gas marketing oil prices oil prices have a significant impact on our ability to generate earnings  fund capital projects  and pay shareholder dividends 
in general  oil prices are affected by many factors  including changes in market demands  global economic activity  political events  weather  and opec production quotas 
more importantly to apco  oil price realizations for oil produced and sold in argentina are significantly influenced by argentine governmental actions as described in the following paragraphs 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future prices  and therefore it is difficult for us to determine what effect increases or decreases in product prices may have on our capital programs  production volumes  or future revenues 
in argentina  politically driven mechanisms significantly influence the sale price of oil produced and sold in the country 
to alleviate the impact of higher crude oil prices on argentina s economy and reduce inflation  the argentine government created an oil export tax and enacted price controls over gasoline prices to force producers and refiners to negotiate oil sales prices significantly below international market levels 
in response to those governmental actions  argentine producers and refiners had to negotiate domestic oil sale prices that take into consideration both net backs for oil exported from argentina and the cost of feedstock to refiners in light of gasoline price controls 
consequently  apco has not benefited from increases in world oil prices over the past several years like producers outside of argentina 
however  gradual increases in gasoline prices from through have enabled producers to negotiate higher oil sales prices with refiners 
the trend of increasing gasoline prices combined with tighter demand for our high quality crude oil has resulted in higher oil price realizations compared with prior years 
our oil sales price per barrel for our consolidated interests averaged for compared with for and in hydrocarbon subsidy programs low oil prices in argentina have inhibited oil exploration investments and consequent oil discoveries in argentina resulting in insufficient replacement of domestic production and a decline in oil reserves in the country over the past several years 
in order to reverse this trend and promote increased oil production and reserves  the argentine government created various hydrocarbon subsidy programs in including the oil plus program 
the programs grant qualifying companies economic benefits in the form of tax credit certificates which can be applied to the payment of export duties paid on hydrocarbon exports or transferred to third parties at face value 
we did not realize any benefit from the oil plus program until during  we have recognized approximately million net to our consolidated interests related to hydrocarbon subsidy programs see other operating revenues below  and approximately million net to our equity interest see investment income below 
both we and petrolera have applied for additional benefits under the oil plus program  however  in february  the argentine government stated its intention to suspend benefits under the oil plus program 
consequently  we cannot predict if either company will be able to recognize any further benefits from this program 
we cannot predict how world oil prices will evolve in and beyond or what additional actions the argentine government will take in response to future fluctuations in world oil prices  the drop in the level of the country s oil reserves or in reaction to changes in the country s fiscal and trade balances 

table of contents natural gas prices we sell our natural gas to argentine customers pursuant to contracts and spot market sales 
as a consequence of the growth in argentina s economy over the past several years  and stimulated by low natural gas prices resulting from a price freeze implemented by the argentine government in  demand for natural gas in argentina has grown significantly 
however  the unfavorable price environment for producers has discouraged natural gas exploration activities 
without significant new discoveries of natural gas reserves in argentina  the supply of natural gas has failed to keep up with increased demand 
the result is a natural gas and power supply shortage in the country 
since  the argentine government has taken several steps to prevent shortages in the domestic market 
natural gas exports to chile were suspended and the country began importing natural gas from bolivia at significantly greater prices than sales prices for natural gas produced in argentina 
in addition  argentina was forced to import high priced lng 
as described in the following paragraphs  resolution is designed to supply natural gas in the domestic market and provide a framework for natural gas prices in argentina 
in  the argentine secretary of energy issued resolution to regulate the supply of natural gas in the domestic market through a natural gas supply agreement referred to as the acuerdo the resolution is intended to provide for equitable sharing of all sectors of the internal natural gas market among producers and establishes a mechanism for doing so based on average natural gas volumes produced from to the resolution determines which sectors of the market will have priority during periods of peak demand 
during peak periods  the residential market will have first priority 
with respect to the lower priced residential market  each producer s share of the residential market will be distributed based on an allocation of its volumes produced during the period to  while natural gas production in excess of those volumes can be sold to electric power generators at regulated prices  and industrial customers at freely negotiated prices 
producers that increased natural gas production since have an advantage compared to those producers whose production decreased over the period because natural gas prices to residential customers remain suppressed at approximately cents per mcf 
the resolution allows producers to choose to participate in the acuerdo natural gas supply agreement or not 
however  if a producer chooses not to participate  then during periods of peak demand  or when there is a shortage of natural gas in the country  the government can nominate non participating producers to be the first to supply excess residential volume demand above the base line demand as projected in the acuerdo  regardless of the non participating producer s contractual commitments 
in general  resolution has had a slightly positive impact on natural gas sales prices in acambuco and tierra del fuego  but  during peak demand periods  it has lowered natural gas sales prices in entre lomas and bajada del palo 
nevertheless  because natural gas revenues from entre lomas and bajada del palo represent approximately three percent of our total operating revenues on an annual basis  the overall impact of the resolution has not been material to our cash flows or results of operations 
our average natural gas sale price per mcf averaged in  in  and during in december  the acuerdo was temporarily extended until the secretary of energy issues another resolution to regulate natural gas markets in argentina 
the level of gas reserves in argentina has fallen in recent years in a country that relies on natural gas for more than percent of its energy consumption 
given the government s tendency to intervene over pricing of a commodity in such high demand  we cannot predict how argentine natural gas prices will evolve in and beyond or whether the current argentine government will continue to maintain tight controls over prices or decide to loosen price controls in response to falling production and reserves 

table of contents seasonality of the products we sell  only natural gas is subject to seasonal demand 
demand for natural gas in argentina is reduced during the warmer months of october through april  with generally lower natural gas prices during this off peak period 
during  natural gas sales represented percent of our total operating revenues compared with percent in and consequently  the fluctuation in natural gas sales between summer and winter is not significant to us 
new accounting standards and emerging issues in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu requires presentation of net income and other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
the update requires separate presentation in both net income and other comprehensive income of reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income 
the new guidance does not change the items reported in other comprehensive income  nor affect how earnings per share is calculated and presented 
we currently report net income in the consolidated statements of income and report other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of changes in equity 
the standard is effective beginning the first quarter of  with a retrospective application to prior periods 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu 
asu defers the effective date for only the presentation requirements related to reclassifications in asu during this deferral period  asu states that we should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before asu all other requirements in asu are not affected by asu  including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
both asu s are effective beginning the first quarter of  with retrospective application to prior periods 
we will apply the new guidance for both asus beginning in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that these particular estimates and assumptions are critical due to their subjective nature and inherent uncertainties  the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of these on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have discussed the following accounting estimates and assumptions as well as related disclosures with our audit committee 
proved reserve estimates 
estimates of our proved reserves included in the unaudited supplemental oil and gas information in this report are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by us gaap and by the sec 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of i the quality and quantity of available data  ii the interpretation of that data  iii the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and iv the judgment of the reserve engineers and geologists that prepare the estimate 

table of contents our proved reserve information is based on estimates prepared by our reserve engineers 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing  and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
our proved reserves are limited to the concession life 
certain of our existing concession terms can be extended for ten years with the consent of and based on terms to be agreed with the argentine government 
the extension of our concessions could materially affect our estimate of proved reserves 
the present value of future net cash flows should not be assumed to be the current market value of the company s estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we based the  and estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on the month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price received for the period january through december with the most current cost information 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used in the estimate 
our estimates of proved reserves materially impact depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record depreciation expense increases  reducing net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost reserves 
in addition  the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of oil and gas producing properties for impairment 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
we review our proved and unproved properties for impairment on a concession by concession basis and recognize an impairment whenever events or circumstances  such as declining oil and gas prices  or unfavorable revisions to our reserve estimates  indicate that a property s carrying value may not be recoverable 
if an impairment is indicated  then a provision is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the present value of the estimated future net revenues fair value 
in estimating future net revenues  we assume costs will escalate annually and apply an oil and gas price forecast that we believe to be reasonable given the pricing environment in argentina 
due to the volatility of oil and gas prices and governmental regulations in argentina  it is possible that the our assumptions regarding oil and gas prices may change in the future 
however  at prices equivalent to those at year end  we do not expect to recognize any impairments in the near term 
we could  depending upon the results of exploration  determine that some or all of our interests in unproved areas need to be impaired as we drill and evaluate certain of these areas in future periods 
for example  we have million of unproved properties related to our operations in colombia  if our exploration drilling planned for is unsuccessful  we may have to recognize an impairment loss related to this asset

table of contents liquidity and capital resources outlook oil price realizations in argentina have been on a steady upward trend since early  reaching an average price of per barrel in december higher oil prices also benefit petrolera s cash flows from operations and its ability to pay dividends 
petrolera s ability to pay dividends is dependent upon numerous factors  including its cash flows provided by operating activities  levels of capital spending  changes in crude oil and natural gas prices  and debt and interest payments 
oil price realizations in argentina continue to be negotiated on a short term basis  and as such  we cannot accurately predict how they will evolve during inflation in argentina has been a persistent problem for some time 
the annual inflation rate was percent or higher in  economists in argentina are predicting similar levels of inflation during in contrast  the argentine peso has not experienced significant devaluation by comparison causing considerable increases in our us dollar cost of operations and capital expenditures 
consequently  our operating income did not increase in line with the upward trend of our oil price realizations in  and there can be no assurance that our margins will improve in we will continue to monitor our capital programs and the quarterly shareholder dividend as necessary to provide us with the financial resources and liquidity needed to continue development drilling in our core properties over the long term  fund new investment opportunities  meet future working capital needs and fund any further cash bonus payments that may be negotiated to obtain concession extensions  if any  while maintaining sufficient liquidity to reasonably protect against unforeseen circumstances requiring the use of funds 
capital exploration expenditures budget for our capital plan provides for million for capital expenditures net to our direct working interests 
we plan to participate in the drilling of gross wells in in addition  we plan on spending approximately million for the acquisition of seismic information 
after taking into consideration the portion of capital expenditures attributable to our equity interest in petrolera  our combined consolidated and equity capital expenditure budget for is million 
any cash bonus payments that may be negotiated to obtain concession extensions would result in additional capital expenditures 
we expect that we and petrolera will have sufficient capital resources to fund our investment programs in we review our capital spending programs throughout the year in light of any changing economic or price conditions and  if necessary  will adjust our planned investments accordingly 
we expect to fund our capital expenditures with cash on hand and cash flows from operations 
liquidity although we have interests in several oil and gas properties in argentina  our direct participation in those neuqu n basin properties in which we are partners with petrolera and dividends from our equity interest in petrolera are the largest contributors to our net cash provided by operating activities 
we have historically funded capital programs and past property acquisitions with internally generated cash flow 
we have not relied on debt or equity as sources of capital due to the turmoil that periodically affects argentina s economy which made financing difficult to obtain on reasonable terms 
although we have not typically relied on debt or equity as sources of capital  successful exploration efforts in argentina or colombia could lead to development capital needs that are currently beyond our ability to fund from operations 
consequently  we may have to consider additional bank financing or some form of equity financing in the future 
such financing may not be available or available on acceptable terms in the future 

table of contents with a cash and cash equivalents balance at december   of million  or percent of total assets  and the ability to adjust capital spending as necessary  we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to effectively manage our business in our liquidity is affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for letters of credit for exploration activities in colombia 
as of december   a total of million was considered restricted and included in restricted cash 
in first quarter  one of our letters of credit for million was reduced by million and extended until september of we expect to renew this upon expiration as our drilling efforts continue 
in the second quarter we issued another million letter of credit collateralized with cash for another exploration block in colombia 
consequently  million of cash is considered restricted as of december  the restricted cash is invested in a short term money market account with a financial institution

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations are exposed to market risks as a result of changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
commodity price risk we have historically not used derivatives to hedge price volatility 
as previously mentioned in md a  oil price realizations for oil produced and sold in argentina are significantly influenced by argentine governmental actions 
in the current regulatory environment  the combination of hydrocarbon export taxes and strict government controls over argentine gasoline prices directly impacts net backs for the sale of crude oil in the domestic argentine market 
as a result  our price is impacted more by government controls than changes in world oil prices 
because our oil prices are negotiated on a short term basis  we cannot accurately predict our future sales prices  and it is difficult for us to determine what effect increases or decreases in world oil prices may have on our results of operations 
inflation  foreign currency and operations risk the majority of our operations and all of our current production is located in argentina which has had a history of high levels of inflation and resulting currency devaluation 
therefore  our financial results may be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  weak economic conditions  or changes in argentina s political climate 
during and  we recorded sizeable foreign currency exchange losses due to the significant devaluation of the argentine peso that occurred as a consequence of argentina s economic problems during and from to mid  the argentine government used monetary policies to keep the peso to us dollar exchange rate stable at approximately although government policies such as regulated gasoline prices and strict controls over natural gas prices have attempted to reduce inflationary pressures in argentina  inflation has averaged approximately percent annually for several years 
since  the peso to us dollar exchange rate has not changed in proportion to these levels of inflation  resulting in significant year over year cost increases when measured in us dollars 
at december   the peso to us dollar exchange rate was argentine economic and political environment argentina has a history of economic and political instability 
because our operations are predominately located in argentina  our operations and financial results have been  and could be in the future  adversely affected by economic  market  currency  and political instability in argentina  as well as measures taken by its government in response to such instability 
argentina s economic and political situation continues to evolve  and the argentine government may enact future regulations or policies that may materially impact  among other items  i the realized prices we receive for the commodities we produce and sell as a result of new taxes  ii the timing of repatriations of cash to the cayman islands  iii our asset valuations  iv peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities  and v restrictions on imports of materials necessary for our operations 
cristina kirchner  wife of former president nestor kirchner  was elected president in december in october  she was overwhelmingly re elected to a second term 
her first term was highlighted by energy policies that controlled prices of hydrocarbons  in particular natural gas prices  subsidies for the import of natural gas at prices far higher than those permitted for the sale of natural gas produced in argentina  close alliances with labor unions  and a monetary policy designed to support the value of the peso 
we cannot predict if current policies in place will continue during her second term 

table of contents immediately after the elections in october  the argentine government revised its policy regarding repatriation of hydrocarbon export proceeds collected in currencies other than peso  forcing companies to repatriate all export revenues to argentina 
before the october decree  companies that exported hydrocarbons were allowed to collect their export sales proceeds outside of argentina and only had to repatriate percent of those proceeds or send us dollars to argentina and convert to pesos 
both we and petrolera export only small volumes of lpg with all oil and natural gas volumes sold in argentina 
although hydrocarbon exports from argentina are not significant  this policy is an indication that the government continues its efforts to support the value of the peso and control movement of capital in and out of the country 
also in october  the government issued another decree which requires companies to obtain approval from the direcci n general de rentas or dgi  the argentine taxing authority before executing a foreign exchange transaction 
we do not expect that this decree will impact us or petrolera 
these new regulations do not impact a company s ability to pay dividends or repatriate funds to its parent company
