the company generates a significant amount of its income from the net interest income earned by middleburg bank 
net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon 
middleburg bank s cost of money is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon 
the quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on non accrual loans and the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses or potential other than temporary impairment of securities 
middleburg investment group s subsidiary  middleburg trust company  generates fee income by providing investment management and trust services to its clients 
investment management and trust fees are generally based upon the value of assets under management  and  therefore can be significantly affected by fluctuations in the values of securities caused by changes in the capital markets 
southern trust mortgage generates fees from the origination and sale of mortgages loans 
southern trust mortgage also maintains a real estate construction portfolio and receives interest and fee income from these loans  which  net of interest expense  is included in net interest income

the provision for loan losses decreased by million for the year ended december  to million compared to million for the same period in the company recognized other than temporary impairment on trust preferred securities of  for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in total non interest income increased by  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in the increase is largely due to gains on the sale of loans by the company s mortgage banking subsidiary  southern trust mortgage 
non interest expense in increased million  up from  driven primarily by commissions related to the increased production at southern trust mortgage  higher recruiting expenses  and increased oreo expenses 
total non interest expenses for the years ended december    and include the consolidated expenses of southern trust mortgage 
although the company is focused on keeping growth in non interest expense low in the future  because of the company s plans to engage in growth and expansion  it is expected that non interest expense will continue to grow in the future at a rate similar to previous years 
the company remains well capitalized with risk adjusted core capital and total capital ratios well above the regulatory minimums 
with the creation of middleburg investment group  the company has expanded the integration of middleburg trust company and middleburg bank s investment services department into a more focused wealth management program for all of the company s clients 
the company intends to make each of its wealth management services available within all of its financial service centers 
also  through the affiliation with southern trust mortgage  middleburg bank plans to continue to increase its loan portfolio by purchasing high credit quality  low loan to value first deeds of trusts on residential property 
middleburg bank plans to continue its focus on low cost deposit growth with advertising campaigns and product development 
the company is not aware of any current recommendations by any regulatory authorities that  if they were implemented  would have a material effect on the registrant s liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and this section are  to some degree  dependent upon the accounting policies of the company 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below is discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important critical accounting policies to the portrayal and understanding of middleburg financial corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
allowance for loan losses middleburg bank monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
middleburg bank maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of controls over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to 
table of contents provide assurance they are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio  and the loan grading system 
middleburg bank evaluates various loans individually for impairment as required by applicable accounting standards 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due by days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment with a group of loans that have similar characteristics 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  middleburg bank makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by applicable accounting standards 
loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of loans losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of middleburg bank as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses is greater than the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses is below the range of reasonable estimates  the allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
middleburg bank recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
intangibles and goodwill the company has approximately million in intangible assets and goodwill at december   a decrease of  since december  which was attributable to regular amortization of intangible assets 
on april   the company acquired middleburg investment advisors  a registered investment adviser  for million 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
in connection with this investment  a purchase price valuation was completed to determine the appropriate allocation to identified intangibles 
the valuation concluded that approximately of the purchase price was related to the acquisition of customer relationships with an amortizable life of years 
another of the purchase price was allocated to a non compete agreement with an amortizable life of years 
the remainder of the purchase price  approximately million  was allocated to goodwill 
on january   middleburg investment advisors was merged into middleburg trust company and it s goodwill balance is reflected in the total goodwill balance reported for middleburg investment group of million 
the remaining balance of unamortized identified intangible assets related to the acquisition of middleburg investment advisors is approximately  approximately million of the million in intangible assets and goodwill at december  is attributable to the company s investment in middleburg trust company 
with the consolidation of southern trust mortgage  the company recognized million in goodwill as part of its equity investment 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for the life span of various customer relationships as well as the value that key members of management add to the success of the company 
for example  customer attrition rates were determined based upon assumptions that the past five years may predict the future 
if the actual attrition rates  among other assumptions  differed from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration in the amortization expense 

table of contents in addition  current accounting standards require that goodwill be tested annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
processes and procedures have been identified for the two step process 
the most recent evaluation was conducted as of december  as of december   the company recognized two consolidated subsidiaries as reporting units for the purpose of goodwill evaluation and reporting southern trust mortgage stm and middleburg investment group mig 
mig is the parent company of middleburg trust company 
the following table shows the allocation of goodwill between the two reporting units and the percentage by which the fair value of each reporting unit as of december  the most recent fair value evaluation date exceeded the carrying value as of that date allocation of goodwill to reporting units dollars in thousands percentage by which fair value carrying value carrying value estimated fair value of reporting reporting of goodwill of reporting unit of reporting unit unit exeeds unit december  december  december  carrying value stm mig total reported amounts reflect only middleburg financial corporation shareholder s ownership interests 
includes  of amortizing intangible assets 
management estimates fair value utilizing multiple methodologies which include discounted cash flows  comparable companies  third party sale and assets under management analysis 
determining the fair value of the company s reporting units requires management to make judgments and assumptions related to various items  including estimates of future operating results  allocations of indirect expenses  and discount rates 
management believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  the fair value of each reporting unit could be different in the future if actual results or market conditions differ from the estimates and assumptions used 
the company s forecasted cash flows for its reporting units assume a stable economic environment and consistent long term growth in loan originations and assets under management over the projected periods 
additionally  expenses are assumed to be consistently correlated with projected asset and revenue growth over the time periods projected 
although we believe the key assumptions underlying the financial forecasts to be reasonable  they are inherently uncertain and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are beyond the control of the company 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the forecasted results will be realized and variations from the forecast may be material 
if weak economic conditions continue or worsen for a prolonged period of time  or if the reporting unit loses key personnel  the fair value of the reporting unit may be adversely affected which may result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets in the future 
any changes in the key management estimates or judgments could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
other than temporary impairment otti approximately  in losses related to other than temporary impairment on trust preferred securities was recognized in at december   the company had  in trust preferred securities in its portfolio 
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  we determine other than temporary impairment for the trust preferred securities in the securities portfolio based on an evaluation of the underlying collateral 
we developed cash flow projections based upon assumptions of default deferral rates  recovery rates  and prepayment rates for the collateral 
the present value of the projected cash flows was calculated by discounting the projected cash flows using the effective yield at purchase in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
finally the present values of the projected cash flows were compared to the 
table of contents carrying values of the securities 
if the present values were less than the carrying value  we determined that the security had an other than temporary impairment equal to the difference between the present value and the carrying value of the bond 
the company may need to recognize additional other than temporary impairments related to trust preferred securities in we evaluate our default assumptions and cash flow projections in relation to the credit performance of the collateral that underlies the trust preferred securities 
should additional deferrals defaults occur on the collateral  projected cash flows from the collateral could be reduced which could result in other than temporary impairments in results of operations net income loss the company had net income for of million  compared to a net loss of million in for  the earnings per diluted share was compared to a loss per diluted share of and earnings per diluted share of for and  respectively

net interest income net interest income represents the principal source of earnings of the company 
net interest income is the amount by which interest generated from earning assets exceeds the expense of funding those assets 
changes in volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income 
net interest income was million for the year ended december  this is an increase of over the million reported for the same period in net interest income for decreased over the million reported for the net interest margin increased basis points to in the net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets

it is anticipated that targeted growth in earning assets and liability repricing opportunities will help mitigate the above mentioned impact to the company s net interest margin 
the asset liability management committee continues to focus on various strategies to maintain the net interest margin

foreclosed property at middleburg bank increased to million at december   compared to million at december  loans more than days past due still accruing were million at december  compared to  at december  non performing assets loans are placed on non accrual status when collection of principal and interest is doubtful  generally when a loan becomes days past due 
there are three negative implications for earnings when a loan is placed on non accrual status 
first  all interest accrued but unpaid at the date that the loan is placed on non accrual status is either deducted from interest income or written off as a loss 
second  accruals of interest are discontinued until it becomes certain that both principal and interest can be repaid 
finally  there may be actual losses that require additional provisions for loan losses to be charged against earnings 
for real estate loans  upon foreclosure  the balance of the loan is transferred to other real estate owned oreo and carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance or the fair market value of the property based on current appraisals and other current market trends  less selling costs 
if a write down of the oreo property is necessary at the time of foreclosure  the amount is charged off against the allowance for loan losses

nonperforming loans decreased million  or  from december  to december  while the allowance for loan losses balance decreased  or  during the same period 
the allowance for loan losses was of non performing loans at december  at december  and the allowance for loan losses was and of non performing loans  respectively 
the decline in this ratio was caused by two primary factors 
loans classified as nonperforming during the periods required smaller specific reserves than previously classified nonperforming loans  and some previously identified nonperforming loans with substantial associated specific reserve balances were charged off during and the combination of these two factors caused the decline in the nonperforming loans ratio from december  to december  management evaluates non performing loans relative to their collateral value and makes appropriate reductions in the carrying value of those loans based on that review

the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement middleburg bank has in particular classes of financial instruments 
middleburg bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments

a summary of the contract amount of middleburg bank s exposure to off balance sheet risk as of december  and is as follows financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk in thousands commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements

the period of time between a loan commitment and closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from to 
table of contents days 
the company mitigates its risk from changes in interest rates through the use of best effort forward delivery commitments  whereby the company commits to sell a loan at the time the borrower commits to an interest rate with the intent that the buyer has assumed interest rate risk on the loan 
as a result  the company is not exposed to losses nor will it realize significant gains related to its rate lock commitments due to changes in interest rates 
the correlation between the rate lock commitment and the best efforts contracts if very high due to their similarity 
the market value of rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts is not readily ascertainable with precision because rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts are not actively traded in stand alone markets 
the company determines the fair value of rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts by measuring the change in the value of the underlying asset while taking into consideration the probability that the rate lock commitments will close 
because of the high correlation between rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts  no gain or loss occurs on the rate lock commitments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk  though it should be noted that the assets under management by middleburg trust company are affected by equity price risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved every three years baring any significant changes 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco of middleburg bank 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies that govern the company s asset liability management related activities  based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change  affecting net interest income  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco uses the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify 
table of contents the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet 
the simulation model is prepared and updated four times during each year 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits  which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a basis point bp upward shift and a basis point downward shift in interest rates 
the following reflects the range of the company s net interest income sensitivity analysis during the fiscal years of and as compared to the board approved policy limit 
estimated net interest income sensitivity rate change december  december  bps bps at the end of  the company s final interest rate risk model indicated that in a rate environment of an immediate basis points increase  net interest income will increase by over a month period 
for the same time period  the final interest rate risk model indicated that  in a rate environment of an immediate basis points decrease  net interest income could decrease by over a month period 
down rate scenarios were not meaningful in the interest rate environment that prevailed as of december  while these numbers are subjective based upon the parameters used within the model  management believes the balance sheet is very balanced and is working to minimize risks to rising rates in the future 
the company s specific goal is to lower where possible the cost of its borrowed funds 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in response to or anticipation of changes in interest rates
