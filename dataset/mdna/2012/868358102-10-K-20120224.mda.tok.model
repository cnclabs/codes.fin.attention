our primary products are provided to workers employed by our customers and  as a result  our business prospects are dependent upon levels of employment among other factors 
our revenues are impacted by the opening and closing of locations by our customers and reductions and increases in headcount by our customers 
additionally  voluntary employee turnover has been reduced significantly as a result of fewer alternative jobs available to employees of our customers 
fewer available jobs coupled with less attrition results in decreased demand for our uniforms and service apparel 
our focus is geared towards mitigating these factors in the current economic environment and has included the following strategies 
we are actively pursuing acquisitions to increase our market share in the image apparel business and it is our intention to continue to seek additional acquisitions that fit into our image apparel business in the future 
secondly  we have diversified our business model to include a sector providing remote staffing solutions to other businesses 
this business segment was initially started to provide these services for the company at a lower cost structure in order to improve our own operating results 
this remote staffing operation  located in el salvador and costa rica  has enabled us to reduce our operating expenses and to more effectively service our customers needs 
we began selling these services to other companies at the end of and as a result  we have grown this business from approximately million in annual revenues in to approximately million in net sales to outside customers in we are aggressively marketing this service to others at this point and see this area as a growth sector in and beyond 
finally  we are pursuing new product lines to enhance our market position in the image apparel business 
toward this end  we entered into a new licensing agreement in january of this new licensing agreement provides us with access to patented technology which will allow us to market image apparel to our customers that will provide them with the ability to turn their uniforms from an expense item into point of sale advertisements that will  in turn  give them the ability to generate advertising revenues for their businesses 
we believe that this new product line will provide us with the opportunity for significant growth in our image apparel business in the future 
we are in the initial stages of marketing this concept to customers and have not generated any revenues of significance at this point 
we have customers in test programs at this point and expect to begin generating meaningful revenues from this new product line in the first half of during the latter part of  cotton prices began increasing dramatically and reached historical highs during due to weather related and other supply disruptions  which when combined with robust global demand  particularly in asia  created concerns about availability in addition to increased costs for our products 
while we were able to pass on a portion of these price increases to our customers during most of  we began to see a negative impact on our gross margins in the fourth quarter of and we expect that this will continue to negatively impact our gross margins in operations net sales change uniforms and related products remote staffing solutions net intersegment eliminations consolidated net sales net sales increased from  in to  in the increase in net sales is split between growth in our uniforms and related products segment and increases in net sales after intersegment eliminations from our remote staffing solutions segment 
intersegment eliminations reduce total net sales for sales of remote staffing solutions to the uniforms and related products segment by the remote staffing solutions segment 
uniforms and related products net sales increased in this increase is attributed to increased market penetration primarily in the healthcare market offset by continued softness in our other markets as the economic environment has remained challenging in remote staffing solutions net sales increased before intersegment eliminations and after intersegment eliminations in this growth is attributed to additional market penetration in as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold for our uniforms and related products segment was in  and in the percentage decrease in as a percentage of net sales is attributed primarily to an increase in direct product costs as a percentage of net sales during the current year due to higher raw material costs primarily related to shortages of cotton offset by lower indirect costs as a percentage of net sales due to the increased volume to cover such costs 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold for our remote staffing solutions segment was in  and in the percentage increase in as compared to is primarily attributed to start up costs associated with taking on new programs to support the substantial growth in this segment in as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses for our uniforms and related products segment approximated in and in the increase as a percentage of sales is attributed primarily to higher amortization of intangible assets associated with the licensing rights we acquired in january of and expense incurred for a major consulting project completed in the current period to study customer markets and to refine our strategic plan to capitalize on the opportunities identified and various other minor increases partially offset by the impact of higher net sales to cover operating expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses for our remote staffing solutions segment approximated in and in the increase as a percentage of sales is attributed primarily to higher salaries and benefits associated with increased hiring to provide infrastructure to support the rapid growth of this business segment and an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts  partially offset by the impact of higher net sales to cover operating expenses 
the effective income tax rate in was and in was 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is attributed primarily to the following an increase in the benefit for untaxed foreign income  a decrease in the state income tax rate  a decrease in the accrual for uncertain tax positions  and the impact of other items  offset by an increase in the rate from the impact of permanent differences between book and tax basis earnings related to share based compensation 
the increase in the benefit for untaxed foreign income is attributed to the amount of untaxed foreign income earned by the company in during the years ended december  and  the company did not recognize deferred income taxes on foreign income of  and  respectively  due to the fact that these amounts are considered to be reinvested indefinitely in the foreign subsidiaries 
based upon our current expectations  the benefit from untaxed foreign income in will be significantly lower unless we determine that our expected investment levels in our foreign subsidiaries will need to be accelerated to handle future growth in these markets 
therefore  we expect our effective tax rate will increase in liquidity and capital resources the company uses a number of standards for its own purposes in measuring its liquidity  such as working capital  profitability ratios  long term debt as a percentage of long term debt and equity  and activity ratios 
the company s balance sheet is very strong at this point and provides the ability to pursue acquisitions  to invest in new product lines and technologies  and to invest in additional working capital as necessary 
we have a million revolving credit facility available for use in the event we should need it  under which   of debt is outstanding at december  approximately  of our cash is held in our foreign subsidiaries and cannot be repatriated without recognizing and paying federal income taxes on this amount 
accounts receivable decreased from  on december  to  as of december  the decrease is primarily attributed to improvement in the overall aging of our receivables 
accounts receivable other increased from  on december  to  as of december  as a result of increased advances to our suppliers to fund higher raw material levels maintained at their facilities 
inventories increased from  on december  to  as of december  this increase is due to a decision by management to increase certain inventory levels in order to better capitalize on potential opportunities for sales growth 
accounts payable increased from  on december  to  on december  this increase is primarily due to increased levels of inventory purchases in other current liabilities increased from  on december  to  on december   due primarily to increased accruals for sales commissions and other incentive compensation attributed to better operating results in long term pension liability increased from  on december  to  on december  the company contributed  to its benefit plans in the contribution was offset by the impact of a reduction in the year end discount rate used to calculate the year end liability for the plans from a range of to at december  to a range of to at december  this change in the discount rates increased the year end liability by approximately  the majority of the remainder of the increase is attributed to normal service costs of  and lower than projected performance on the plans assets in the current year

at december   the company had  shares remaining for purchase under its common stock repurchase authorization 
shares purchased under the share repurchase program are constructively retired and returned to unissued status 
we consider several factors in determining when to make share repurchases  including among other things  our cost of equity  our after tax cost of borrowing  our debt to total capitalization targets and our expected future cash needs 
there is no expiration date or other restriction governing the period over which we can make our share repurchases under the program 
the company anticipates that it will continue to pay dividends and that it will repurchase additional shares of its common stock in the future as financial conditions permit 
in  cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately  the company used  in cash from operating activities   in investing activities consisting of the acquisition of intangible assets of  and  in net capital expenditures  and used  in financing activities

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting estimates are those that we believe require our most significant judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates  the underlying judgments and uncertainties used to make them and the likelihood that materially different estimates would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions is as follows allowance for losses on accounts receivable these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
an additional impairment in value of one percent of net accounts receivable would require an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and would result in additional expense of approximately  the company s concentration of risk is also monitored and at year end  one customer had an account balance greater than of receivables and the five largest customer account balances totaled  additionally  the company advances funds for certain of its suppliers to purchase raw materials 
the company deducts payment for these raw materials from payments made to the suppliers upon completion of the related finished goods 
the company had a receivables balance from one of its suppliers located in haiti totaling approximately  at december  this amount is included in accounts receivable other on the consolidated balance sheet 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to customers 
historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories 
if actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
insurance the company self insures for certain obligations related to health insurance programs 
the company also purchases stop loss insurance policies to protect it from catastrophic losses 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for losses that have occurred  but have not been reported 
the company s estimates consider historical claim experience and other factors 
the company s liabilities are based on estimates  and  while the company believes that the accrual for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts recorded 
changes in claim experience  the company s ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments used by management could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any period 
pensions the company s pension obligations are determined using estimates including those related to discount rates  asset values and changes in compensation 
the discount rates used for the company s pension plans of to were determined based on the citigroup pension yield curve 
this rate was selected as the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled on the measurement date taking into account the nature and duration of the benefit obligations of the plan using high quality fixed income investments currently available rated aa or better and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
the expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical long term investment returns as well as future expectations given target investment asset allocations and current economic conditions 
the rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases in salaries among continuing active participants accruing benefits under the plans 
in  a reduction in the expected return on plan assets of would have resulted in additional expense of approximately  while a reduction in the discount rate of would have resulted in additional expense of approximately  and would have reduced the funded status by  for the company s defined benefit pension plans 
interest rates and pension plan valuations may vary significantly based on worldwide economic conditions and asset investment decisions 
income taxes the company is required to estimate and record income taxes payable for federal and state jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing accounting treatment between tax and book that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  accruals are also estimated for federal and state tax matters for which deductibility is subject to interpretation 
taxes payable and the related deferred tax differences may be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes in tax rates and changes in taxable profits and losses 
federal income taxes are not provided on that portion of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be reinvested indefinitely 
reserves are also estimated for uncertain tax positions that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
for the year ending december   we recognized a net decrease in total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately  as of december   we had an accrued liability of  for unrecognized tax benefits 
we accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense  and the related liability is included in the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
share based compensation the company recognizes expense for all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  in the financial statements based on their fair values 
share based compensation expense that was recorded in and includes the compensation expense for the share based payments granted in those years 
in the company s share based compensation strategy we utilize a combination of stock options and stock appreciation rights sars that fully vest on the date of grant 
therefore  the fair value of the options and sars granted is recognized as expense on the date of grant 
the company used the black scholes merton valuation model to value any share based compensation 
option valuation methods  including black scholes merton  require the input of assumptions including the risk free interest rate  dividend rate  expected term and volatility rate 
the company determines the assumptions to be used based upon current economic conditions 
the impact of changing any of the individual assumptions by would not have a material impact on the recorded expense
