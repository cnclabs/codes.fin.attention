item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to the historical information  the discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements due to applications of our critical accounting policies and factors including  but not limited to  those set forth under the caption risk factors in item a of part i of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of clean and intelligent energy management applications  services and products for the smart grid  which include comprehensive demand response  data driven energy efficiency  energy price and risk management  and enterprise carbon management applications  services and products 
our energy management applications  services and products enable cost effective energy management strategies for commercial  institutional and industrial end users of energy  which we refer to as our c i customers  and our electric power grid operator and utility customers by reducing real time demand for electricity  increasing energy efficiency  improving energy supply transparency  and mitigating carbon emissions 
we believe that we are the largest demand response service provider to c i customers 
as of december   we managed over  megawatts  or mw  of demand response capacity across a c i customer base of approximately  accounts and  sites throughout multiple electric power grids 
demand response is an alternative to traditional power generation and transmission infrastructure projects that enables electric power grid operators and utilities to reduce the likelihood of service disruptions  such as brownouts and blackouts  during periods of peak electricity demand  and otherwise manage the electric power grid during short term imbalances of supply and demand or during periods when energy prices are high 
we use our network operations center  or noc  and comprehensive demand response application  demandsmart  to remotely manage and reduce electricity consumption across a growing network of c i customer sites  making demand response capacity available to electric power grid operators and utilities on demand while helping c i customers achieve energy savings  improved financial results and environmental benefits 
to date  we have received substantially all of our revenues from electric power grid operators and utilities  who make recurring payments to us for managing demand response capacity that we share with our c i customers in exchange for those c i customers reducing their power consumption when called upon 
we build on our position as a leading demand response services provider by using our noc and energy management application platform to deliver a portfolio of additional energy management applications  services and products to new and existing c i  electric power grid operator and utility customers 
these additional energy management applications and services include our efficiencysmart  supplysmart and carbonsmart applications and services  and certain other wireless energy management products 
efficiencysmart is our data driven energy efficiency suite that includes commissioning and retro commissioning authority services  energy consulting and engineering services  a persistent commissioning application and an enterprise energy management application for managing energy across a portfolio of sites 
supplysmart is our energy price and risk management application that provides our c i customers located in restructured or deregulated markets throughout the united states with the ability to more effectively manage the energy supplier selection process  including energy supply product procurement and implementation  budget forecasting  and utility bill management 
carbonsmart is our enterprise carbon management application that supports and manages the measurement  tracking  analysis  reporting and management of greenhouse gas emissions 
our wireless energy management products are designed to ensure that our c i customers can connect their equipment remotely and access meter data securely  and include both cellular modems and an agricultural specific wireless technology solution acquired as part of our acquisition of mm 
since inception  our business has grown substantially 
we began by providing demand response services in one state in and expanded to providing our portfolio of energy management applications  services and products in several regions throughout the united states  as well as internationally in australia  canada  new zealand and the united kingdom 

table of contents significant recent developments in february  pjm interconnection  or pjm  a grid operator customer  and monitoring analytics  llc  the pjm market monitor  issued a joint statement concerning settlements in pjm s capacity market  from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenues  for participants using a certain baseline methodology for the measurement and verification of demand response 
we refer to this as the pjm statement 
the pjm statement  among other things  asserted that certain market practices in the pjm capacity market were no longer appropriate or acceptable and unilaterally implied that compensation should no longer be determined by actual measured reductions in a c i customer s electrical load  unless the reductions are below that c i customer s peak demand for electricity  or plc  in the prior year 
in march  we filed for and were granted expedited declaratory relief with the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc  which allowed us to continue to manage our portfolio of demand response capacity in pjm as we had in the past and receive settlement in accordance with the then current pjm market rules approved by ferc 
however  pjm continued to take steps to modify the market rules according to the pjm statement  including by filing proposed tariff changes with ferc 
in november  ferc issued an order that addressed the pjm statement and clarified the rules related to the measurement and verification of demand response resources in the pjm capacity market 
we refer to this as the ferc order 
the ferc order  among other things  preserved pjm s original market rules for the full compliance period of the delivery year  while accepting pjm s proposed market rule changes going forward  subject to certain conditions  including the requirement that pjm submit a compliance filing with ferc by january  that included the development of an interim mechanism to protect demand response suppliers reasonable reliance expectations regarding capacity compliance measurement and verification for the delivery year through the delivery year and explained how pjm will treat the aggregation of demand response resources under its proposal 
in addition  the ferc order encouraged further examination of the limitations of plc and consideration of the development of a more dynamic baseline methodology applicable to demand response resources in the future 
in january  pjm responded to the ferc order by making the compliance filing referred to above  which proposed the immediate implementation of pjm s proposed market rules 
we refer to this as the pjm proposal 
we subsequently filed a protest requesting that ferc reject the pjm proposal as unjust and unreasonable for failure to meet the conditions set forth in the ferc order to establish an interim settlement mechanism that protects the reasonable reliance expectations of demand response suppliers through the delivery year 
we also requested that ferc order pjm to keep current settlement practices in place for the delivery year and require pjm to propose an alternative mechanism that complies with ferc s directives through the delivery year 
subsequent to our protest filing  additional filings were made by certain parties interested in the outcome of this matter 
in february  ferc issued an order substantially accepting the pjm proposal  which resulted in the immediate implementation of pjm s proposed market rule changes regarding capacity compliance measurement and verification 
as a result  our future pjm revenues and profit margins will be significantly reduced and our future results of operations and financial condition will be negatively impacted 
these impacts may be offset by our future growth in mws in the pjm market 
revenues and expense components revenues we derive recurring revenues from the sale of our energy management applications  services and products 
we do not recognize any revenues until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and we deem collection to be reasonably assured 
our revenues from our demand response services primarily consist of capacity and energy payments  including ancillary services payments 
we derive revenues from demand response capacity that we make available in open market programs and pursuant to contracts that we enter into with electric power grid operators and utilities 
in certain markets  we enter into contracts with electric power grid operators and utilities  generally ranging from three to years in duration  to deploy our demand response services 
we refer to these contracts as utility contracts 

table of contents where we operate in open market programs  our revenues from demand response capacity payments may vary month to month based upon our enrolled capacity and the market payment rate 
where we have a utility contract  we receive periodic capacity payments  which may vary monthly or seasonally  based upon enrolled capacity and predetermined payment rates 
under both open market programs and utility contracts  we receive capacity payments regardless of whether we are called upon to reduce demand for electricity from the electric power grid  and we recognize revenue over the applicable delivery period  even where payments are made over a different period 
we generally demonstrate our capacity either through a demand response event or a measurement and verification test 
this demonstrated capacity is typically used to calculate the continuing periodic capacity payments to be made to us until the next demand response event or measurement and verification test establishes a new demonstrated capacity amount 
in most cases  we also receive an additional payment for the amount of energy usage that we actually curtail from the grid during a demand response event 
we refer to this as an energy payment 
as program rules may differ for each open market program in which we participate and for each utility contract  we assess whether or not we have met the specific service requirements under the program rules and recognize or defer revenues as necessary 
we recognize demand response capacity revenues when we have provided verification to the electric power grid operator or utility of our ability to deliver the committed capacity under the open market program or utility contract 
committed capacity is verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a measurement and verification test 
once the capacity amount has been verified  the revenues are recognized and future revenues become fixed or determinable and are recognized monthly over the performance period until the next demand response event or measurement and verification test 
in subsequent demand response events or measurement and verification tests  if our verified capacity is below the previously verified amount  the electric power grid operator or utility customer will reduce future payments based on the adjusted verified capacity amounts 
under certain utility contracts and open market program participation rules  our performance and related fees are measured and determined over a period of time 
if we can reliably estimate our performance for the applicable performance period  we will reserve the entire amount of estimated penalties that will be incurred  if any  as a result of estimated underperformance prior to the commencement of revenue recognition 
if we are unable to reliably estimate the performance and any related penalties  we defer the recognition of revenues until the fee is fixed or determinable 
any changes to our original estimates of net revenues are recognized as a change in accounting estimate in the earliest reporting period that such a change is determined 
we defer incremental direct costs incurred related to the acquisition or origination of a utility contract or open market program in a transaction that results in the deferral or delay of revenue recognition 
as of december  and  the incremental direct costs deferred were approximately and million  respectively 
these deferred expenses would not have been incurred without our participation in a certain open market program and will be expensed in proportion to the related revenue being recognized 
during the years ended december  and no contract origination costs were deferred 
during the year ended december   we deferred contract origination costs of million 
during the year ended december   as a result of the termination of a certain contract  the million of previously deferred incremental direct costs were expensed 
in addition  we capitalize the costs of our production and generation equipment utilized in the delivery of our demand response services and expense this equipment over the lesser of its useful life or the term of the contractual arrangement 
during the year ended december  and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  of production and generation equipment costs 
we believe that this accounting treatment appropriately matches expenses with the associated revenue 
as of december   we had over  mw under management in our demand response network  meaning that we had entered into definitive contracts with our c i customers representing over  mw of demand response capacity 
in determining our mw under management in the seasonal demand response programs in which we participate  we typically count the maximum demand response capacity for a c i customer site over a trailing twelve month period as the mw under management for that c i customer site 
however  the trailing period could be longer in certain programs under which significant rule changes have occurred or under which we do not have enough obligation to enroll all of our mw in a given program period  but have enough obligation in a future program period to enroll the mw again 
we generally begin earning 
table of contents revenues from our mw under management within approximately one month from the date on which we enable the mw  or the date on which we can reduce the mw from the electricity grid if called upon to do so 
the most significant exception is the pjm forward capacity market  which is a market from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenues 
because pjm operates on a june to may program year basis  a mw that we enable after june of each year may not begin earning revenue until june of the following year 
this results in a longer average revenue recognition lag time in our c i customer portfolio from the point in time when we consider a mw to be under management to when we earn revenues from that mw 
certain other markets in which we currently participate  such as the iso ne market  or choose to participate in the future operate or may operate in a manner that could create a delay in recognizing revenue from the mw that we enable in those markets 
additionally  not all of our mw under management may be enrolled in a demand response program or may earn revenue in a given program period or year based on the way that we manage our portfolio of demand response capacity 
in the pjm open market program in which we participate  the program year operates on a june to may basis and performance is measured based on the aggregate performance during the months of june through september 
as a result  fees received for the month of june could potentially be subject to adjustment or refund based on performance during the months of july through september 
we had historically concluded that we could reliably estimate the amount of fees potentially subject to adjustment or refund  and recorded a reserve for this amount in the month of june 
as of june   we had recorded an estimated reserve of million related to potential subsequent performance adjustments 
the fees under this program were fixed as of september  and  based on final performance during the three months ended september   we recorded a reduction in the estimated reserve totaling million  which resulted in final performance adjustments of million 
we have re evaluated our ability to reliably estimate the amount of fees potentially subject to adjustment or refund for the year ending december   or fiscal  on a prospective basis based on our consideration of our actual performance during the months of june through september  as well as additional guidance issued by pjm regarding its interpretation of certain program rules and changes to certain program rules that will impact performance calculations on a prospective basis 
based on the changes to certain program rules  we have concluded that we no longer have the ability to reliably estimate the amount of fees potentially subject to adjustment or refund until the performance period ends on september th of each year 
therefore  on a prospective basis  all revenues related to our participation in pjm open market program will be recognized at the end of the performance period  or during the three months ended september th of the applicable year 
in addition  in accordance with our policy to capitalize direct and incremental costs associated with deferred revenues to the extent that such costs are realizable  we will capitalize the associated cost of our payments to c i customers for the month of june and expense such capitalized costs when the associated deferred revenues are recognized 
we will evaluate the direct and incremental costs for recoverability prior to capitalization 
in february  ferc issued an order substantially accepting the pjm proposal  which resulted in the immediate implementation of pjm s proposed market rule changes regarding capacity compliance measurement and verification 
as a result  our future pjm revenues and profit margins will be significantly reduced and our future results of operations and financial condition will be negatively impacted 
these impacts may be offset by our future growth in mws in the pjm market 
revenues generated from open market sales to pjm  a grid operator customer  accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues for the years ended december   and under certain utility contracts and open market programs  such as pjm s emergency load response program  the period during which we are required to perform may be shorter than the period over which we receive payments under that contract or program 
in these cases  we record revenue  net of reserves for estimated penalties related to potential delivered capacity shortfalls  over the mandatory performance obligation period  and a portion of the revenues that have been earned is recorded and accrued as unbilled revenue 
our unbilled revenue of million from pjm at december  will be billed and collected through june our unbilled revenue of million as of december  was collected in full through june revenues generated from open market sales to iso ne  a grid operator customer  accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues for the years ended december   and 
table of contents in addition to demand response revenues  we generally receive either a subscription based fee  consulting fee or a percentage savings fee for arrangements under which we provide our other energy management applications and services  specifically our efficiencysmart  supplysmart and carbonsmart applications and services  and certain other wireless energy management products 
revenues derived from these offerings were million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and our revenues have historically been higher in our second and third fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due to seasonality related to the demand response market 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for our demand response services consists primarily of amounts owed to our c i customers for their participation in our demand response network and are generally recognized over the same performance period as the corresponding revenue 
we enter into contracts with our c i customers under which we deliver recurring cash payments to them for the capacity they commit to make available on demand 
we also generally make an additional payment when a c i customer reduces consumption of energy from the electric power grid during a demand response event 
the equipment and installation costs for our devices located at our c i customer sites  which monitor energy usage  communicate with c i customer sites and  in certain instances  remotely control energy usage to achieve committed capacity are capitalized and depreciated over the lesser of the remaining estimated customer relationship period or the estimated useful life of the equipment  and this depreciation is reflected in cost of revenues 
we also include in cost of revenues our amortization of acquired developed technology  amortization of capitalized internal use software costs related to our demandsmart application  the monthly telecommunications and data costs we incur as a result of being connected to c i customer sites  and our internal payroll and related costs allocated to a c i customer site 
certain costs  such as equipment depreciation and telecommunications and data costs  are fixed and do not vary based on revenues recognized 
these fixed costs could impact our gross margin trends described elsewhere in this annual report on form k during interim periods 
cost of revenues for our efficiencysmart  supplysmart and carbonsmart applications and services  and certain other wireless energy management products include our amortization of capitalized internal use software costs related to those applications  services and products  third party services  equipment costs  equipment depreciation  and the wages and associated benefits that we pay to our project managers for the performance of their services 
gross profit and gross margin gross profit consists of our total revenues less our cost of revenues 
our gross profit has been  and will be  affected by many factors  including a the demand for our energy management applications  services and products  b the selling price of our energy management applications  services and products  c our cost of revenues  d the way in which we manage  or are permitted to manage by the relevant electric power grid operator or utility  our portfolio of demand response capacity  e the introduction of new clean and intelligent energy management applications  services and products  f our demand response event performance and g our ability to open and enter new markets and regions and expand deeper into markets we already serve 
our outcomes in negotiating favorable contracts with our c i customers  as well as with our electric power grid operator and utility customers  the effective management of our portfolio of demand response capacity and our demand response event performance are the primary determinants of our gross profit and gross margin 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of selling and marketing  general and administrative  and research and development expenses 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
we grew from full time employees at december  to full time employees at december  substantially as a result of the acquisitions we completed during the year ended december  in addition  we incur significant up front costs associated with the expansion of the number of mw under our management  which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 
we expect our overall operating expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future and to increase as a percentage of total annual revenues 
table of contents in the near term as we continue to invest in our business and employee base in order to capitalize on emerging opportunities  expand the development of our energy management applications  services and products  and grow our mw under management 
in addition  amortization expense from intangible assets acquired in future acquisitions will increase our operating expenses in future periods 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  including costs associated with share based payment awards  related to our sales and marketing organization  b commissions  c travel  lodging and other out of pocket expenses  d marketing programs such as trade shows and e other related overhead 
commissions are recorded as an expense when earned by the employee 
we expect our selling and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future and to increase as a percentage of total annual revenues in the near term as we further increase the number of our sales professionals 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  including costs associated with share based payment awards and bonuses  related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and operations organizations  b facilities expenses  c accounting and legal professional fees  including fees associated with acquisitions  d contract termination costs  e depreciation and amortization and f other related overhead 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future and to increase as a percentage of total annual revenues in the near term as we further invest in our infrastructure and employee base to support our continued growth 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  including costs associated with share based payment awards  related to our research and development organization  b payments to suppliers for design and consulting services  c costs relating to the design and development of new energy management applications  services and products and enhancement of existing energy management applications  services and products  d quality assurance and testing and e other related overhead 
during the years ended december   and  we capitalized internal software development costs of million  million and million  respectively  and the amount is included as software in property and equipment at december  included in the amounts above  we capitalized million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  related to a company wide enterprise resource planning systems implementation project  which was placed into production in june and is being amortized over a five year useful life 
during the three months ended december   as a result of our review and our realignment of development efforts  we discontinued our efforts to complete the development of a certain in process research and development indefinite lived intangible asset related to our march acquisition of zox 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge related to this indefinite lived in process research and development intangible asset of million and an impairment charge related to the associated definite lived patent intangible asset of less than million 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future and to slightly increase as a percentage of total annual revenues in the near term as we develop new technologies and further invest in our research and development organization 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc   stock compensation 
as such  all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  are recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values as of the date of grant 
for stock options granted prior to january   the fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model  and for stock options granted on or after january   the fair value of each award is and will be estimated on the date of grant using a lattice 
table of contents valuation model 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded expenses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  in connection with share based payment awards to employees and non employees 
with respect to option grants through december   a future expense of non vested options of approximately million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
for non vested restricted stock and restricted stock units subject to service based vesting conditions outstanding as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
for non vested restricted stock subject to performance based vesting conditions outstanding and that were probable of vesting as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
for non vested restricted stock subject to performance based vesting conditions outstanding and that were not probable of vesting as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense 
other income and expense  net other income and expense consist primarily of gain or loss on transactions designated in currencies other than our or our subsidiaries functional currency  interest income earned on cash balances  and other non operating income and expense 
we historically have invested our cash in money market funds  treasury funds  commercial paper  and municipal bonds 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest on our capital lease obligations  fees associated with the loan and security agreement that we and one of our subsidiaries entered into with svb in august  which was subsequently amended and which we refer to as the credit facility  fees associated with the credit facility  and fees associated with issuing letters of credit and other financial assurances 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues the following table summarizes our revenues for the years ended december  and in thousands december  dollar change percentage change revenues demandsmart efficiencysmart  supplysmart  carbonsmart and other total revenues 
table of contents for the year ended december   our demand response revenues decreased by million  or  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in our demandsmart revenues was primarily attributable to changes in the following existing operating areas dollars in thousands revenue decrease increase december  to december  pjm new england new york public service company of new mexico  or pnm ontario power authority  or opa california australia ercot xcel energy salt river project  or srp uk national grid tucson electric power  or tep other total decreased demand response revenues the decrease in our demandsmart revenues during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to less favorable pricing in the pjm and new york markets  as well as a decrease in mw enrolled in our iso ne program as compared to the same period in due to the commencement of an iso ne program in june  under which we enrolled fewer mw with lower pricing compared to the iso ne program in effect prior to june the decrease in demandsmart revenues was also partially attributable to fewer demand response events being called by pjm during the year ended december   which resulted in decreased energy payments  as compared to the same period in the decrease in demandsmart revenues was also partially attributable to a decrease in mw under management in our pnm program during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the decrease in demandsmart revenues was partially offset by an increase in revenues recognized as a result of amendments to the opa contract during the year ended december  that resulted in the recognition of million of revenues during the period that had been previously deferred 
the decrease in demandsmart revenues was also partially offset by stronger demand response event performance in our california demand response programs  our ability to recognize revenues based on the finalization of performance in a certain california demand response program  and an increase in our mw under management in the xcel energy  srp  uk national grid  and certain other demand response programs in which we participate 
the decrease in demandsmart revenues was also partially offset by our participation in demand response programs in australia and the tep demand response program 
we did not receive any revenues related to the australia or tep programs in the year ended december  for the year ended december   our efficiencysmart  supplysmart and carbonsmart applications and services and other revenues increased by million as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to our acquisitions of global energy and mm  both of which occurred in january in addition  we completed a certain efficiencysmart project during the three months ended september   which resulted in the recognition of million of revenues that had been previously deferred 
we currently expect our total revenues to decrease for the year ending december  as compared to the same period in  primarily due to an expected decrease in revenues derived from the pjm market 
the decrease in revenues derived from the pjm market is due to an expected decline in enrolled mw a decline in 
table of contents pjm prices during the year ending december  as compared to the same period in and the implementation of pjm s proposed market rule changes regarding capacity compliance measurement and verification 
until pjm prices return to more historic levels  we expect our revenues derived from the pjm market to decrease as a percentage of total annual revenues 
we expect that this decrease will be partially offset as we further increase our mw under management in our other expanded operating regions  enroll new c i customers in our demand response programs  expand the sales of our efficiencysmart  supplysmart and carbonsmart applications and services and other services and products to our new and existing c i customers  and pursue more favorable pricing opportunities with our c i customers 
in addition  the discontinuance of pjm s interruptible load for reliability program  beginning in will reduce the flexibility that we currently have to manage our portfolio of demand response capacity in the pjm market and will negatively impact our future revenues 
gross profit and gross margin the following table summarizes our gross profit and gross margin percentages for our energy management applications  services and products for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  gross profit gross margin gross profit gross margin the increase in gross profit during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily due to our ability to recognize revenues that had previously been deferred in connection with the opa contract  pursuant to which we recognized the cost of such revenues in prior periods due to the uncertainty of the realizability of these costs 
the increase in gross profit was also partially attributable to stronger demand response event performance in certain of the demand response programs in which we participate  including iso ne  which in some cases resulted in increased energy payments for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  as well as our ability to recognize revenues based on the finalization of performance in a certain california demand response program for which the corresponding cost of revenues were recorded during the year ended december  the acquisitions that we completed in also contributed to the increase in gross profit for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit was partially offset by less favorable pricing in pjm and iso ne  as well as fewer demand response events being called by pjm during the year ended december   which resulted in decreased energy payments from pjm  as compared to the same periods in the slight increase in gross margin during the year ended december   as compared to the same period in was primarily due to the recognition of revenues in connection with the opa contract  pursuant to which we recognized the cost of revenues in prior periods due to the uncertainty of the realizability of these costs 
the increase was partially offset by less favorable pricing in pjm and iso ne  which was not entirely offset by lower payments to our c i customers 
we currently expect that our gross margin for the year ending december  will be lower than our gross margin for the year ended december   and that our gross margin for the three months ending september  will be the highest gross margin among our four quarterly reporting periods in  consistent with our gross margin pattern in  due to seasonality related to the demand response industry 
this expected decrease in gross margin is primarily the result of a decrease in mw enrolled in the pjm market  a decrease in pjm prices in as compared to  which will not be entirely offset by lower payments to our c i customers and the implementation of pjm s proposed market rule changes regarding capacity compliance measurement and verification 

table of contents operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percentage change operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative research and development total in certain forward capacity markets in which we participate  such as pjm  we may enable our c i customers  meaning we may install our equipment at a c i customer site to allow for the curtailment of mw from the electric power grid  up to twelve months in advance of enrolling the c i customer in a particular demand response program 
this market feature creates a longer average revenue recognition lag time across our c i customer portfolio from the point in time when we consider a mw to be under management to when we earn revenues from that mw 
because we incur operational expenses  including salaries and related personnel costs  at the time of enablement  there has been a trend of incurring operating expenses associated with enabling our c i customers in advance of recognizing the corresponding revenues 
the increase in payroll and related costs within our operating expenses during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily driven by an increase in headcount  from full time employees at december  to full time employees at december   which was substantially due to the acquisitions that we completed in we have reclassified certain costs in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  totaling  previously included in selling and marketing expenses as general and administrative expenses to more appropriately reflect the nature of these costs consistent with costs in these costs commenced in the year ended december  and therefore no reclassification was required for the year ended december  the following table summarizes the reclassifications between selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  in thousands reclassifications for the year ended december  selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses payroll and related costs stock based compensation other total 
table of contents selling and marketing expense the following table summarizes our selling and marketing expenses for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percentage change payroll and related costs stock based compensation other total the increase in selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs associated with an increase in the number of selling and marketing full time employees from at december  to at december  the increase was offset by a decrease in sales commissions payable to employees in our sales organization of million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the decrease in stock based compensation for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily due to significant stock based awards granted in that became fully vested prior to june  the decrease was also partially attributable to the reversal of stock based compensation expense due to forfeitures of a greater number of stock based awards in connection with an increase in our attrition rate 
these decreases were offset by a full year of stock based compensation expense related to awards granted during the year ended december  and by stock based compensation expense related to awards granted during the year ended december  the increase in other selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to an increase in amortization expense of million due to the customer relationship and trade name intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions that we completed in during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the discontinued use of the trade name intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions of energy response and other immaterial acquisitions in  which also contributed to the increase in selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in in addition  during the year ended december   as a result of the discontinuation of certain customer relationships related to our acquisition of eq  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the three months ended december   which was included in selling and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the increase in other selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was also partially attributable to an increase in professional services fees of million 
the increase in other selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  was offset by a decrease in marketing costs of million due to our rebranding efforts that took place in general and administrative expenses the following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percentage change payroll and related costs stock based compensation other total

we recorded our estimate of the fair value of the deferred purchase price consideration based on the evaluation of the likelihood of the achievement of the contractual conditions that would result in the payment of the deferred purchase price consideration prior to seven years from the acquisition date and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes 
this fair value measurement was based on significant inputs not observable in the market and therefore  represented a level measurement as defined in asc the cash portion of the deferred purchase price consideration of less than million is recorded as a liability  discounted to reflect the time value of money 
as the milestone payment date approaches  the fair value of this liability will increase 
the fair value of the deferred purchase price consideration of million  related to the  shares of common stock to be issued upon the milestone payment date has been classified as additional paid in capital within stockholders equity 
with respect to the cash portion of the deferred purchase price consideration  the increase in fair value is recorded as an expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of less than million related to the accretion for the time value of money discount 
at december   the liability was recorded at million 
the deferred purchase price consideration to be paid in shares meets the requirements of an equity instrument and  accordingly  will not be remeasured at fair value each reporting period 
this acquisition had no contingent consideration or earn out payments 
as of december   we had no debt obligations  but had outstanding letters of credit totaling million under the credit facility 
as of december   we had million available under the credit facility for future borrowings or issuances of additional letters of credit 
in march  we and one of our subsidiaries entered into the amended and restated credit facility  under which svb became the sole lender  our borrowing limit was decreased from million to million and certain of our financial covenant compliance requirements were modified 
as a result  we are reasonably assured that we will be in compliance with our financial covenants under the amended and restated credit facility for the foreseeable future 
we typically grant certain customers a limited warranty that guarantees that our hardware products will substantially conform to current specifications for one year from the delivery date 
based on our operating history  the liability associated with product warranties has been determined to be nominal 
we also indemnify our customers from third party claims relating to the intended use of our products 
pursuant to these clauses  we indemnify and agree to pay any judgment or settlement relating to a claim 
we guaranteed the electrical capacity we have committed to deliver pursuant to certain long term contracts 
such guarantees may be secured by cash or letters of credit 
performance guarantees as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
these performance guarantees included deposits held by certain customers of million and million  respectively  at december  and december  off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
we have issued letters of credit in the ordinary course of our business in order to participate in certain demand response programs 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million

table of contents additional information non gaap financial measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis  we disclose certain non gaap measures that exclude certain amounts  including non gaap net income loss  non gaap net income loss per share  adjusted ebitda and free cash flow 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative for  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the gaap measure most comparable to non gaap net income loss is gaap net income loss  the gaap measure most comparable to non gaap net income loss per share is gaap net income loss per share  the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted ebitda is gaap net income loss  and the gaap measure most comparable to free cash flow is cash flows from operating activities 
reconciliations of each of these non gaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measure are included below 
use and economic substance of non gaap financial measures used by enernoc management uses these non gaap measures when evaluating our operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes 
management believes that such measures help indicate underlying trends in our business  are important in comparing current results with prior period results  and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing our operating performance 
for example  management considers non gaap net income or loss to be an important indicator of our overall performance because it eliminates certain of the more significant effects of our acquisitions and related activities and non cash compensation expenses 
in addition  management considers adjusted ebitda to be an important indicator of our operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trend 
moreover  management considers free cash flow to be an indicator of our operating trend and performance of our business 
the following is an explanation of the non gaap measures that we utilize  including the adjustments that management excluded as part of the non gaap measures for the years ended december   and  respectively  as well as reasons for excluding these individual items management defines non gaap net income loss as net income loss before expenses related to stock based compensation and amortization expenses related to acquisition related intangible assets  net of related tax effects 
management defines adjusted ebitda as net income loss  excluding depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  interest  income taxes and other income expense 
adjusted ebitda eliminates items that represent certain of the more significant effects of our acquisitions and related activities  that are not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay  such as stock based compensation 
adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation  which is based on our estimate of the useful life of tangible assets 
these estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset  are based on historic cost incurred to build out our deployed network and may not be indicative of current or future capital expenditures 
management defines free cash flow as net cash provided by used in operating activities less capital expenditures 
management defines capital expenditures as purchases of property and equipment  which includes capitalization of internal use software development costs 
material limitations associated with the use of non gaap financial measures non gaap net income loss  non gaap net income loss per share  adjusted ebitda and free cash flow may have limitations as analytical tools 
the non gaap financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with  and not as a substitute for or superior to the financial information presented in accordance with gaap and should not be considered measures of our liquidity 
there are significant limitations associated with the use of non gaap financial measures 
further  these measures may differ from the non gaap information  even where similarly titled  used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare our performance to that of other companies

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuations and purchase price allocations related to business combinations  expected future cash flows including growth rates  discount rates  terminal values and other assumptions and estimates used to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill  amortization methods and periods  certain accrued expenses and other related charges  stock based compensation  contingent liabilities  tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
any differences could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in appendix a to this annual report on form k  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with asc  revenue recognition formerly staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or asc in all of our arrangements  we do not recognize any revenues until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and we deem collection to be reasonably assured 
in making these judgments  we evaluate these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider a definitive agreement signed by the customer and us or an arrangement enforceable under the rules of an open market bidding program to be representative of persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we consider delivery to have occurred when service has been delivered to the customer and no significant post delivery obligations exist 
in instances where customer acceptance is required  delivery is deemed to have occurred when customer acceptance has been achieved 
fees are fixed or determinable 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within normal payment terms 
if the fee is subject to refund or adjustment and we cannot reliably estimate this amount  we recognize revenues when the right to a refund or adjustment lapses 
if offered payment terms significantly exceed our normal terms  we recognize revenues as the amounts become due and payable or upon the receipt of cash 
collection is reasonably assured 
we conduct a credit review at the inception of an arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is reasonably assured if  based upon our evaluation  we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  revenues are deferred and recognized upon the receipt of cash 
we enter into contracts and open market bidding programs with utilities and electric power grid operators to provide demand response applications  services and products 
demand response revenues consist of two elements revenue earned based on our ability to deliver committed capacity to our electric power grid operator and utility customers  which we refer to as capacity revenue  and revenue earned based on additional payments made to us for the amount of energy usage actually curtailed from the grid during a demand response event  which we refer to as energy event revenue 
we recognize demand response revenue when we have provided verification to the electric power grid operator or utility of our ability to deliver the committed capacity which entitles us to payments under the utility contract or open market program 
committed capacity is generally verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a measurement and verification test 
once the capacity amount has been verified  the revenue is recognized and future revenue becomes fixed or determinable and is recognized monthly until the next demand response event or test 
in subsequent verification events  if our verified capacity is below the previously verified amount  the electric power grid operator or utility customer will reduce future payments based on the adjusted verified capacity amounts 
ongoing demand response revenue recognized between demand response events or tests that are not subject to penalty or customer refund are recognized in revenue 
if the revenue is subject to refund and the amount of refund cannot be reliably estimated  the revenue is deferred until the right of refund lapses 
we have evaluated the factors within asc regarding gross versus net revenue reporting for our demand response revenues and payments to c i customers 
based on the evaluation of the factors within asc  we determined that all of the applicable indicators of gross revenue reporting were met 
these applicable indicators of gross revenue reporting included  but were not limited to  the following we are the primary obligor in our arrangements with electric power grid operators and utility customers because we provide demand response services directly to electric power grid operators and utilities under long term contracts or pursuant to open market programs and contract separately with c i customers to deliver such services 
we manage all interactions with the electric power grid operators and utilities  while 
table of contents c i customers do not interact with the electric power grid operators and utilities 
in addition  we assume the entire performance risk under arrangements with electric power grid operators and utility customers  including the posting of financial assurance to assure timely delivery of committed capacity with no corresponding financial assurance received from c i customers 
in the event of a shortfall in delivered committed capacity  we are responsible for all penalties assessed by the electric power grid operators and utilities without regard for any recourse we may have with our c i customers 
we have latitude in establishing pricing  as the pricing under our arrangements with electric power grid operators and utilities is negotiated through a contract proposal and contracting process or determined through a capacity auction 
we then separately negotiate payment to c i customers and have complete discretion in the contracting process with the c i customer 
we have complete discretion in determining the supplier c i customer to provide the demand response services  provided that the c i customer is located in the same region as the applicable electric power grid operator or utility 
we are involved in both the determination of service specifications and performing part of the services  including the installation of metering and other equipment for the monitoring  data gathering and measurement of performance  as well as  in certain circumstances  the remote control of c i customer loads 
as a result  we determined that we earn revenue as a principal from the delivery of demand response services to electric power grid operators and utility customers and we record the amounts billed to the electric power grid operators and utility customers as gross demand response revenues and the amounts paid to c i customers as cost of revenues 
in one of the open market programs in which we participate  the program year operates on a june to may basis and performance is measured based on the aggregate performance during the months of june through september 
as a result  fees received for the month of june could potentially be subject to adjustment or refund based on performance during the months of july through september 
we have historically concluded that we could reliably estimate the amount of fees potentially subject to adjustment or refund and recorded a reserve for this amount in the month of june 
as of june   we recorded an estimated reserve of million related to potential subsequent performance adjustments 
the fees under this program were fixed as of september  and  based on final performance during the three months ended september   we recorded a reduction in the estimated reserve totaling million  which resulted in final performance adjustments of million 
we have re evaluated our ability to reliably estimate the amount of fees potentially subject to adjustment or refund for fiscal on a prospective basis based on our consideration of our historical performance under this program  as well as additional guidance issued by the customer regarding its interpretation of certain program rules and changes to certain program rules that will impact performance calculations on a prospective basis 
based on the changes to certain program rules  we have concluded that we no longer have the ability to reliably estimate the amount of fees potentially subject to adjustment or refund until the performance period ends on september th of each year 
therefore  on a prospective basis  all revenues related to our participation in this program will be recognized at the end of the performance period or during the three months ended september th of the applicable year 
in addition  in accordance with our policy to capitalize direct and incremental costs associated with deferred revenues to the extent that such costs are realizable  we will capitalize the associated cost of our payments to c i customers for the month of june and expense such capitalized costs when the associated deferred revenues are recognized 
we will evaluate the direct and incremental costs for recoverability prior to capitalization 
as a result of contractual amendments entered into during the year ended december  to amend certain refund provisions included in one of our contracts with a utility customer  we concluded that we could reliably estimate the fees potentially subject to refund and  therefore  the fees under this arrangement were fixed or determinable 
as a result  during the year ended december   we recognized as revenues million of fees that had been previously deferred 
as of december   there were no deferred revenues related to this contractual arrangement 

table of contents certain of the forward capacity programs in which we participate may be deemed derivative contracts under asc  derivatives and hedging  or asc in such situations  we believe we meet the scope exception under asc as a normal purchase  normal sale as that term is defined in asc and  accordingly  the arrangement is not treated as a derivative contract 
energy event revenues are recognized when earned 
energy event revenue is deemed to be substantive and represents the culmination of a separate earnings process and is recognized when the energy event is initiated by the electric power grid operator or utility customer and we have responded under the terms of the contract or open market program 
under certain of our arrangements  in particular those arrangements entered into by our wholly owned subsidiary  mm  we sell proprietary equipment to c i customers that is utilized to provide the ongoing services that we deliver 
currently  this equipment has been determined to not have stand alone value 
as a result  we defer the fees associated with the equipment and we begin recognizing those fees ratably over the expected c i customer relationship period  which is generally years  once the c i customer is receiving the ongoing services from us 
in addition  we capitalize the associated direct and incremental costs  which primarily represent the equipment and third party installation costs  and recognize such costs over the expected c i customer relationship period 
in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  ratified asc update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu asu amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently within the scope of asc  which is the revenue recognition guidance for multiple element arrangements 
asu provides for three significant changes to the existing multiple element revenue recognition guidance as follows eliminates the requirement to have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for undelivered elements in an arrangement 
this may result in more deliverables being treated as separate units of accounting  modifies the manner in which the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separately identified deliverables 
asu requires an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using its best estimate of selling prices  or esp  of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  or vsoe  or third party evidence of selling price  or tpe  if vsoe is not available 
each separate unit of accounting must have a selling price  which can be based on management s estimate when there is no other means vsoe or tpe to determine the selling price of that deliverable 
the arrangement consideration is allocated based on the elements relative selling prices  and eliminates use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method  which results in the discount in the transaction being evenly allocated to the separate units of accounting 
as required  we adopted asu at the beginning of the first quarter of the fiscal year ended december   or fiscal  on a prospective basis for transactions originating or materially modified on or after january  asu generally does not change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions 
the impact of adopting asu was not material to our fiscal financial statements  and if it was applied in the same manner to the fiscal year ended december   would not have had a material impact to revenue for such period 
we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a significant impact on the timing and pattern of revenue recognition in the future due to our limited number of multiple element arrangements 
the key impact that we expect the adoption of asu to have relates to certain efficiencysmart service arrangements with c i customers who also provide curtailment of capacity as part of our demand response arrangements 
historically  we recorded the fees recognized under these arrangements as a reduction of cost of revenues as evidence of fair value did not exist for certain efficiencysmart services due to the limited history of selling these separately and lack of availability of tpe 
as previously stated  the impact of asu has not been and is not expected to be material 
we typically determine the selling price of our services based on vsoe 
consistent with our methodology under previous accounting guidance  we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices 
table of contents for the specific service when sold on a stand alone basis 
in determining vsoe  our policy is to require a substantial majority of selling prices for a product or service to be within a reasonably narrow range 
we also consider the class of customer  method of distribution  and the geographies into which our products and services are sold into when determining vsoe 
we typically have had vsoe for our products and services 
in certain circumstances  we are not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement 
this may be due to the infrequent occurrence of stand alone sales for an element  a limited sales history for new services or pricing within a broader range than permissible by our policy to establish vsoe 
in those circumstances  we proceed to the alternative levels in the hierarchy of determining selling price 
tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in stand alone sales to similarly situated customers 
we are typically not able to determine tpe and have not used this measure since we have been unable to reliably verify standalone prices of competitive solutions 
esp is established in those instances where neither vsoe nor tpe are available  considering internal factors such as margin objectives  pricing practices and controls  customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle 
consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing information gathered from experience in customer negotiations  market research and information  recent technological trends  competitive landscape and geographies 
use of esp is limited to a very small portion of our services  principally certain efficiencysmart services 
business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we estimate the fair value of contingent consideration at the time of the acquisition using all pertinent information known to us at the time to assess the probability of payment of contingent amounts 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
we use the income approach to determine the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets  including customer contracts  customer relationships  non compete agreements and trade names 
this approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates and expected trends  including introductions by competitors of new services and products 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and market participant investment risk factors 
the use of different assumptions could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial condition and results of operations 
customer relationships represent established relationships with customers  which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional energy management applications  services and products 
non compete agreements represent arrangements with certain employees that limit or prevent their ability to take employment at a competitor for a fixed period of time 
trade names represent acquired product names that we intend to continue to utilize 
we have also utilized the cost approach to determine the estimated fair value of acquired indefinite lived intangible assets related to acquired in process research and development given the stage of development as of the acquisition date and the lack of sufficient information regarding future expected cash flows 
the cost approach calculates fair value by calculating the reproduction cost of an exact replica of the subject intangible asset 
we calculate the replacement cost based on actual development costs incurred through the date of acquisition 
in determining the appropriate valuation methodology  we consider  among other factors the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the expected introduction date  and the estimated useful 
table of contents life of the technology 
we believe that the estimated in process research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
impairment of intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows 
amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years 
we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
during the year ended december   as a result of a discontinuation of certain trade names acquired in connection with the acquisitions of energy response and another immaterial acquisition  we determined that these definite lived intangible assets were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of these assets to zero  which was included in selling and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended december   as a result of the discontinuation of certain customer relationships related to our acquisition of eq  we recorded an impairment charge of million which was included in selling and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended december   as a result of a change in the expected period of economic benefit of the trade name acquired in our acquisition of cogent  we determined that an impairment indicator existed 
based on the analysis performed  we determined that this trade name was partially impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million during the year ended december   which is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the fair market value of less than million was determined using level inputs  as defined by asc  fair value measurements and disclosures formerly sfas no 
 fair value measurement  or asc  based on the projected future cash flows over the revised period of economic benefit discounted based on our weighted average cost of capital of 
goodwill in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other formerly fasb sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or asc  we test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
we have determined that we currently have reporting units our consolidated australian operations and all other operations 
although our chief operating decision maker  which is our chief executive officer and executive management team  collectively  make business decisions based on the evaluation of financial information at the entity level  certain discrete financial information is available related to our consolidated australian operations with such discrete financial information utilized by the business unit manager to manage the consolidated australian operations and make decisions for those operations 
the consolidated australian operations are comprised of the operations acquired in the acquisitions of energy response and another immaterial acquisition  as well as the operations of our subsidiary  enernoc australia pty ltd 
events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment 
table of contents assessment include  but are not limited to  current economic and market conditions  including a decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate or operational performance of the business  and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
our annual impairment test date is november in performing the test  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under asc the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units  as defined  to the fair value of these units 
we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  including an independent valuation to conduct this test 
the valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales or offerings of similar companies 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as the date of the impairment test on our weighted average cost of capital 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
in order to determine the fair value of our reporting units we utilize both a market approach based on the quoted market price of our common stock and the number of shares outstanding and a discounted cash flow analysis  or dcf  under the income approach 
the key assumptions that drive the fair value in the dcf model are the discount rates ie  weighted average cost of capital  or wacc  terminal values  growth rates  and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
if the current worldwide financial markets and economic environment were to deteriorate  this would likely result in a higher wacc because market participants would require a higher rate of return 
in the dcf  as the wacc increases  the fair value decreases 
the other significant factor in the dcf is its projected financial information ie  amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates and if its assumptions were to be adversely impacted  this could result in a reduction of the fair value of the entity 
we conducted our annual impairment test as of november  as a result of completing the first step  the fair value exceeded the carrying value  and as such the second step of the impairment test was not required 
to date  we have not been required to perform the second step of the impairment test 
as of the annual impairment test date  and as of december   our market capitalization exceeded the fair value of our consolidated net assets 
subsequent to december   we have experienced a decline in our market capitalization 
a prolonged significant decline in our market capitalization could result in failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test and a goodwill impairment charge 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
the annual impairment testing process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
impairment of property and equipment we review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is recognized in earnings and equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
if these assets are not impaired  but their useful lives have decreased  the remaining net book value is amortized over the revised useful life 
during the years ended december  and  we identified impairment indicators related to certain demand response equipment as a result of the removal of such equipment from service during those years 
as a result of these impairment indicators  we performed impairment tests and recognized impairment charges of million during both of the years ended december  and  representing the difference between the carrying value and fair market value of the demand response equipment  which is included in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the fair market value was determined utilizing level inputs  as defined by asc  based on the projected future cash flows discounted using the estimated market participant rate of return for this type of asset 

table of contents during the years ended december  and  we identified potential impairment indicators related to certain demand response and back up generator equipment as a result of lower than estimated demand response event performance by these assets 
as a result of the potential indicators of impairment  we performed impairment tests 
the applicable long lived assets are measured for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or liabilities 
we determined that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset group over its remaining estimated useful life would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset group 
we determined the fair value of the asset group using a discounted cash flow technique based on level inputs  as defined by asc  and a discount rate of  which we determined represents a market rate of return for the assets being evaluated for impairment 
we recorded impairment charges of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  which are reflected in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the impairment charges were allocated to the individual assets within the asset group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets 
as of december   approximately million of our generation equipment was utilized in a certain open market program 
the recoverability of the carrying value of this generation equipment is largely dependent on the rates that we are compensated for our committed capacity within this program 
these rates represent market rates and can fluctuate based on the supply and demand of capacity 
although these market rates are established up to three years in advance of the service delivery  these market rates have not yet been established for the entire remaining useful life of this generation equipment 
in performing an impairment analysis  we estimate the expected future market rates based on current existing market rates and trends 
a decline in the expected future market rates of by itself would not result in an impairment charge related to this generation equipment 
during the year ended december   we identified impairment indicators related to certain demand response equipment as a result of lower than estimated demand response event performance in certain demand response programs and the removal of demand response equipment from service during the year ended december  as a result of these impairment indicators  we recorded impairment charges of million during the year ended december   presenting the difference between the carrying value and fair market value of demand response equipment  which is included in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the fair market value was determined utilizing level inputs  as defined by asc  based on the projected future cash flows discounted using the estimated market participant rate of return for this type of asset 
software development costs we capitalize eligible costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use 
we capitalize the payroll and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the development of internal use computer software 
we amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software  which is generally two to three years 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value and impairment of the capitalized costs  and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized 
software development costs of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  have been capitalized 
we capitalized million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  related to a company wide enterprise resource planning systems implementation project  which was placed into production in june and is being amortized over a five year useful life 
stock based compensation our amended and restated stock option and incentive plan  which we refer to as the plan  and our amended and restated employee  director and consultant stock plan  which we refer to as the plan  provide for the grant of incentive stock options  nonqualified stock options  restricted and unrestricted stock awards and other stock based awards to our eligible employees  directors and consultants 
options granted under 
table of contents both the plan and the plan are exercisable for a period determined by us  but in no event longer than ten years from the date of the grant 
option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards generally vest ratably over four years  with certain exceptions 
the plan expired upon our ipo in may any forfeitures under the plan that occurred after the effective date of the ipo are available for future grant under the plan up to a maximum of  shares 
during the years ended december    and  we issued   and  shares of our common stock  respectively  to certain executives to satisfy a portion of our compensation obligations to those individuals 
as of december    shares were available for future grant under the plan 
for stock options granted prior to january   the fair value of each option was estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
for stock options granted on or after january   the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice valuation model 
the lattice model considers characteristics of fair value option pricing that are not available under the black scholes model 
similar to the black scholes model  the lattice model takes into account variables such as expected volatility  dividend yield rate  and risk free interest rate 
however  in addition  the lattice model considers the probability that the option will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life and the probability of termination or retirement of the option holder in computing the value of the option 
for these reasons  we believe that the lattice model provides a fair value that is more representative of actual experience and future expected experience than the value calculated using the black scholes model 
volatility measures the amount that a stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate during a period 
as there was no public market for our common stock prior to the effective date of the ipo  we determined volatility based on an analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies that issued options with substantially similar terms 
the expected volatility of options granted has been determined using an average of the historical volatility measures of this peer group of companies  as well as the historical volatility of our common stock beginning january  during the three months ended september   we determined that we had sufficient history to utilize company specific volatility in accordance with asc  stock compensation  or asc  and we are now calculating volatility using a component of implied volatility and historical volatility to determine the value of share based payments 
the risk free interest rate is the rate available as of the option date on zero coupon united states government issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock in the past and do not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the terms of the credit facility preclude us from paying dividends 
during the year ended december   we updated our estimated exit rate pre vesting and post vesting applied to options  restricted stock and restricted stock units based on an evaluation of demographics of our employee groups and historical forfeitures for these groups in order to determine our option valuations as well as our stock based compensation expense 
the changes in estimate of the volatility  exit rate pre vesting and exit rate post vesting did not have a material impact on our stock based compensation expense recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
we have determined a forfeiture rate of as of december  ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded expenses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  in connection with share based payment awards to employees and non employees 
with respect to option grants through december   a future expense of non vested options of approximately million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
for non vested restricted stock and restricted stock units subject to service based vesting conditions outstanding as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average years 
for non vested restricted stock subject to 
table of contents performance based vesting conditions outstanding as of december  and that were probable of vesting as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
for non vested restricted stock subject to performance based vesting conditions outstanding as of december  and that were not probable of vesting as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense 
for awards with graded vesting  we allocate compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
accordingly  we amortized the fair value of each award over each award s service period  which is generally the vesting period 
our accounting for stock options issued to non employees requires valuing and remeasuring such stock options to the current fair value until the performance date has been reached 
stock based compensation expense recorded for the years ended december   and related to stock options to non employees was not material 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between financial reporting and taxes bases of our assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse 
we have incurred consolidated net losses since our inception and as a result  we had not recognized net united states deferred taxes as of december  or december  our deferred tax liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and property and equipment 
our deferred tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards  accruals and reserves  and stock based compensation 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
in accordance with asc  income taxes  or asc  we are required to evaluate uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements formerly fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
asc also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition and defines the criteria that must be met for the benefits of a tax position to be recognized 
we had no unrecognized tax benefits as of december  and in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  it is not required that we have a provision for income taxes for any years subject to audit 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
in the event our assumptions are incorrect  the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements intangibles goodwill and other in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  or asu  which gives companies the option to first perform a 
table of contents qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if a company concludes that this is the case  it must perform the two step test 
otherwise  a company can forgo the two step test 
asu is effective for fiscal years that begin after december   however  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of asu  including whether we will early adopt 
we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs in may  the fasb issued asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  or asu  which amends fasb s accounting guidance related to fair value measurements in order to more closely align its disclosure requirements with those in international financial reporting standards 
asu clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and also changes certain principles or requirements for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
presentation of comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income  or asu  which represents new accounting guidance related to the presentation of other comprehensive income oci 
asu eliminates the option to present components of oci as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity  which is the option that we currently use to present oci 
asu allows for a one statement or two statement approach  outlined as follows one statement approach present the components of net income and total net income  the components of oci and a total for oci  along with the total of comprehensive income in a single continuous statement 
two statement approach present the components of net income and total net income in the statement of net income 
a statement of oci would immediately follow the statement of net income and include the components of oci and a total for oci  along with the total of comprehensive income 
asu also required an entity to present on the face of the financial statements any reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from oci to net income see below 
asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 or asu asu defers only those changes in asu that related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments and supersedes only those paragraphs that pertain to how and where reclassification adjustments are presented 
all other requirements in asu are not affected by asu  including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements  effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu and asu will not have an effect on our financial condition or results of operations  but will only impact how certain information related to how oci is presented in the consolidated financial statements

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to unique economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
a substantial majority of our foreign expense and sales activities are transacted in local currencies  including australian dollars  british pounds  canadian dollars and new zealand dollars 
in addition  our foreign sales are denominated in local currencies 
fluctuations in the foreign currency rates could affect our sales  cost of revenues and profit margins and could result in exchange losses 
in addition  currency devaluations can result in a loss if we maintain deposits in a foreign currency 
during each of the years ended december   and  less than of our sales were generated outside the united states 
the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries that are incurred in local currencies did not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition for the year ended december  and we do not expect that they will have a material effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition for the year ending december  our operating results and certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are affected by changes in the relative strength of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currency 
our expenses denominated in foreign currencies are positively affected when the us dollar strengthens against the applicable foreign currency and adversely affected when the us dollar weakens 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred foreign exchange losses of million  million and less than million  respectively 
the significant increase in losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies for the year ended december  as compared to the same periods in and  was due to the significant increase of foreign denominated intercompany receivables held by us from one of our australian subsidiaries primarily as a result of the funding provided to complete the acquisition of energy response in july and the strengthening of the us dollar as compared to the australian dollar from the date of acquisition through december  during the years ended december   and  there were no material realized losses incurred related to transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
as of december   we had an intercompany receivable from our australian subsidiary that is denominated in australian dollars and not deemed to be of a long term investment nature totaling million  or million australian 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in foreign currencies that we transact in would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations other than the impact on the unrealized gain loss on the intercompany receivable held by us from our australian subsidiary that is denominated in australian dollars  for which a hypothetical increase or decrease in the foreign currency would result in an incremental million gain or loss 
we currently do not have a program in place that is designed to mitigate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we are evaluating certain potential programs  including the use of derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to a reduction in us dollar value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates 
the utilization of forward foreign currency contracts would reduce  but would not eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
interest rate risk as of december   we had no outstanding debt under the credit facility 
the recent market events have not required us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposure to interest rate risk 
we manage our cash and cash equivalents portfolio considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents  money market funds  and commercial paper 
we have  in the past  held municipal auction rate 
table of contents securities that have since been redeemed 
as our investments are made with highly rated securities  we are not anticipating any significant impact in the short term from a change in interest rates
