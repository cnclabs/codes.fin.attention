item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations description of the company we are one of the world s largest meat protein companies and the second largest food production company in the fortune with one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry 
we produce  distribute and market chicken  beef  pork  prepared foods and related allied products 
our operations are conducted in four segments chicken  beef  pork and prepared foods 
some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products  the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace  accessibility of international markets  market prices for our products  the cost of live cattle and hogs  raw materials  grain and feed ingredients  and operating efficiencies of our facilities 
overview general as a result of improved internal performance  strong exports and favorable domestic chicken market conditions  our operating results remained strong in fiscal despite a billion increase in input costs 
the following are a few of the key drivers we continued to focus on maximizing our margins through margin management and operational efficiency improvements 
margin management improvements occurred in the areas of mix  export sales  price optimization and value added products initiatives 
the operational efficiencies occurred in the areas of yields  cost reduction and labor management 
domestic chicken market conditions improved in fiscal driven by reduced industry supplies 
the improved domestic chicken market conditions were partially offset by operating losses in our foreign start up businesses 
our beef segment experienced periods of reduced demand for beef products  particularly in the first half of fiscal  but was able to remain profitable as a result of improved balance between beef demand and cattle supply 
our pork segment remained within its normalized operating margin range despite periods of unfavorable pricing environments due to periods of increased domestic availability of pork products 
our prepared foods segment experienced favorable mix changes and lower raw material costs resulting in earnings within its operating margin range 
margins with an operating margin of in fiscal  we have achieved operating income exceeding billion for three consecutive years 
the following is a summary of operating margins by segment chicken or excluding million related to the impairment of non core assets beef pork prepared foods debt and liquidity during fiscal  we generated billion of operating cash flows 
additionally  we issued billion of senior notes due in and used the proceeds to retire all of our senior notes due in as a result of this transaction  we will realize approximately million in annualized interest savings 
we also repurchased million shares of our stock for million under our share repurchase program in fiscal at september   we had billion of liquidity  which includes the availability under our credit facility and billion of cash and cash equivalents 
our accounting cycle resulted in a week year for fiscal  and in millions  except per share data net income attributable to tyson net income attributable to tyson per diluted share net income included the following items million non cash charge  or per diluted share  related to the impairment of non core assets in china  and million pretax charge  or per diluted share  related to the early extinguishment of debt 
net income included the following items million gain  or per diluted share  related to a sale of interests in an equity method investment  and million reduction to income tax expense  or per diluted share  related to a reversal of reserves for foreign uncertain tax positions 
net income included the following items million in pretax charges  or per diluted share  related to losses on notes repurchased during fiscal  million non cash  non tax deductible charge  or per diluted share  related to a full goodwill impairment in an immaterial chicken segment reporting unit  million non cash  non tax deductible charge  or per diluted share  related to the impairment of an equity method investment  and million pretax gain  or per diluted share  from insurance proceeds 

table of contents fiscal outlook our continued capital investment in our businesses  strong liquidity and reduced interest expense has put us in a strong position as we begin a challenging fiscal the drought conditions in the summer of reduced grain supplies  which will result in higher input costs as well as increased costs for cattle and hog producers 
usda data indicates in fiscal overall domestic protein production chicken  beef  pork and turkey is expected to decrease compared to fiscal  which should continue to support improved pricing 
the following is a summary of the fiscal outlook for each of our segments  as well as an outlook on sales  capital expenditures  net interest expense  debt and liquidity  share repurchases and dividends chicken current usda data shows us chicken production will be down slightly in fiscal due to the reduced crop supply  we expect higher grain costs in fiscal compared to fiscal of approximately million 
however  the capital investment and significant operational  mix and pricing improvements we have made in our chicken segment have better positioned us to adapt to rising grain prices 
for fiscal  we anticipate our chicken segment will remain profitable  but could be below our normalized range of 
beef we expect to see a reduction of industry fed cattle supplies of in fiscal as compared to fiscal although we generally expect adequate supplies in regions we operate our plants  there may be periods of imbalance of fed cattle supply and demand 
we anticipate beef exports will remain strong 
for fiscal  we believe our beef segment will remain profitable  but could be below our normalized range of 
pork we expect industry hog supplies in fiscal to be flat compared to fiscal and pork exports to remain strong 
for fiscal  we believe our pork segment will be in or above our normalized range of 
prepared foods we expect operational improvements and increased pricing to offset increased raw material costs 
because many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter term in nature  we are typically able to offset rising input costs through increased pricing 
for fiscal  we believe our prepared foods segment will remain in its normalized range of 
sales we expect fiscal sales to increase to approximately billion mostly resulting from price increases related to decreases in domestic availability of protein and rising raw material costs 
capital expenditures our preliminary capital expenditures plan for fiscal is approximately million 
the reduction in planned capital expenditures from fiscal is primarily a result of an anticipated rise in working capital needs in fiscal once we gain more visibility into our working capital needs  or should forecasted conditions change  we may raise our capital expenditures target 
we will continue to make significant investments in our production facilities for high return operational efficiencies  other profit improvement projects and development of our foreign operations 
net interest expense we expect fiscal net interest expense will approximate million 
debt and liquidity we do not have any significant maturities of debt due until october we may use our available cash to repurchase notes when available at attractive rates 
total liquidity at september   was billion  well above our goal to maintain liquidity in excess of billion 
share repurchases we expect to continue repurchasing shares under our share repurchase plan 
in fiscal  we repurchased million shares for approximately million 
as of september   million shares remain authorized for repurchases 
the timing and extent to which we repurchase shares will depend upon  among other things  our working capital needs  market conditions  liquidity targets  our debt obligations and regulatory requirements

our notes may be converted to class a stock early during any fiscal quarter in the event our class a stock trades at or above for at least trading days during a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter 
in this event  the note holders may require us to pay outstanding principal in cash  which totaled million at september  any conversion premium would be paid in shares of class a stock 
the conditions for early conversion were not met in our fourth quarter of fiscal  and thus  the notes may not be converted in our first quarter of fiscal on and after july   until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date  which is october   holders may convert their notes at any time  regardless of the foregoing circumstances 
due to the early conversion option regardless of conversion conditions beginning in july  we have recorded the notes balance of million and remaining discount of million as current debt in our consolidated balance sheets at september  should the holders exercise their early conversion option  we would use current cash on hand and or cash flow from operations for principal payments 
we presently plan to use current cash on hand and or cash flows from operations for payment on the notes not converted early upon maturity 
at september   approximately of our cash is held in the international accounts of our foreign subsidiaries 
generally  we do not rely on the foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs  but rather we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed

for the purpose of this calculation  debt is defined as the sum of current and long term debt 
total capitalization is defined as debt plus total shareholders equity 
our ratio of debt to our total capitalization increased in fiscal primarily resulting from the net increase in our debt balance from issuing the billion notes and extinguishing the million notes
