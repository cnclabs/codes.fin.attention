executive summary fiscal we experienced significant fluctuations in consumer demand during fiscal as compared to fiscal when strong fashion trends aided us in setting record breaking quarterly results 
while toning and athletic footwear were key drivers of our sales for fiscal  our non athletic footwear  particularly sandals and boots  contributed significantly to our comparable store sales increase as well 
during fiscal  athletic footwear  particularly performance running product  remained a strong performer 
however  the popularity of toning footwear continued its significant decline in fiscal and negatively affected our quarterly comparable store sales and gross profit margin throughout the year 
consumer traffic increased during the back to school season  however  these increases in traffic were of short duration 
sales began to weaken late in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter as unseasonably warm weather was experienced throughout the united states 
as a result  consumer demand for fall footwear  particularly boots  declined significantly 
consequently  heavy promotional activity was required during the fourth quarter to effectively sell through this inventory 
despite the challenges presented by the changes in consumer demand  we were able to manage our inventories and control our costs such that operating income  as a percentage of sales  declined only to for fiscal  as compared to the prior year 
we achieved earnings per diluted share of in fiscal  which is second only to our record earnings per diluted share of in fiscal 
table of contents additionally for fiscal net sales increased in fiscal and comparable store sales increased 
our gross profit margin decreased to from in fiscal our merchandise margin decreased while buying  distribution and occupancy costs  as a percentage of sales  remained unchanged 
the decrease in our merchandise margin was primarily the result of the heavy promotional activity during the fourth quarter to effectively sell through our fall footwear  particularly boots 
we generated cash from operations net of purchases of property and equipment of million and ended fiscal with million in cash and cash equivalents and no interest bearing debt 
inventories at january  increased million compared to the end of the prior year 
approximately one third of this increase was attributable to our net store growth and the addition of our e commerce business 
the remaining increase was due in large part to a planned increase in the pairs of footwear within current key categories as well as the early arrival of certain athletic product for the spring selling season 
we opened new stores during fiscal and launched our e commerce site during the third quarter 
nine stores were relocated to new locations and approximately of our stores were also remodeled during the year 
fiscal we are focused on growing our business as we move into fiscal we expect to open approximately new stores with over one third of these stores located in two new major markets dallas  texas and puerto rico 
these new major markets  coupled with our e commerce site which launched in the third quarter of fiscal  offer us the opportunity to acquire significant additional exposure for our brand 
also for fiscal comparable store sales are expected to increase in the low single digits 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase  primarily due to the cost to operate the additional stores and an increase in pre opening costs 
with the increase in pre opening costs  we anticipate selling  general and administrative expenses will increase slightly as a percentage of sales  as compared to fiscal total pre opening costs are expected to increase approximately million over fiscal of the total increase in pre opening costs for fiscal  million will be included in selling  general and administrative expenses  and another million of pre opening rent and freight will be included in cost of sales 
in addition to opening approximately new stores  we anticipate relocating ten and closing five 
we are targeting approximately of our stores for remodel 
the remodels at the majority of these locations are being performed to coincide with lease renewal activities 
critical accounting policies it is necessary for us to include certain judgments in our reported financial results 
these judgments involve estimates based in part on our historical experience and incorporate the impact of the current general economic climate and company specific circumstances 
however  because future events and economic conditions are inherently uncertain  our actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the accounting policies that require the more significant judgments are included below 

table of contents merchandise inventories our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market lcm as of the balance sheet date and consist primarily of dress  casual and athletic footwear for men  women and children 
the cost of our merchandise is determined using the first in  first out valuation method fifo 
for determining market value  we estimate the future demand and related sale price of merchandise in our inventory 
the stated value of merchandise inventories contained on our consolidated balance sheets also includes freight  certain capitalized overhead costs and reserves 
we review our inventory at the end of each quarter to determine if it is properly stated at lcm 
factors considered include  among others  recent sale prices  the length of time merchandise has been held in inventory  quantities of the various styles held in inventory  seasonality of the merchandise  expected consideration to be received from our vendors and current and expected future sales trends 
we reduce the value of our inventory to its estimated net realizable value where cost exceeds the estimated future selling price 
merchandise inventories as of january  and january  totaled million and million  respectively  representing approximately of total assets for both periods 
given the significance of inventories to our consolidated financial statements  the determination of net realizable value is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
material changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the actual net realizable value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment subject to depreciation  are evaluated for impairment on a periodic basis if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this evaluation includes performing an analysis of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived assets 
assets are grouped and the evaluation performed at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows  which is generally at a store level 
if the estimated future cash flows for a store are determined to be less than the carrying value of the store s assets  an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of our long lived assets using store specific cash flow assumptions discounted by a rate commensurate with the risk involved with such assets while incorporating marketplace assumptions 
our assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment  including current and future economic trends for stores  are subject to a high degree of judgment 
assets subject to impairment are adjusted to estimated fair value and  if applicable  an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our long lived assets as of january  and january  totaled million and million  respectively  representing approximately of total assets for both periods 
our evaluations performed during fiscal and fiscal resulted in non cash impairment charges of  and million  respectively 
if actual operating results or market conditions differ from those anticipated  the carrying value of certain of our assets may prove unrecoverable and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
insurance reserves we self insure a significant portion of our workers compensation  general liability and employee health care costs and also maintain insurance in each area of risk protecting us from individual and aggregate losses over specified dollar values 
we review the liability reserved for our self insured portions on a quarterly basis  taking into consideration a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors  statistical trends and  in certain instances  valuation assistance provided by independent third parties 
our self insurance reserves include estimates of both claims filed  carried at their expected ultimate settlement value  and claims incurred but not yet reported 
as of january  and january   our self insurance reserves totaled million and million  respectively 
while we believe that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurance that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimating process 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to future losses or gains that could be material 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
as a result of this process  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
our temporary timing differences relate primarily to inventory  depreciation  accrued expenses  deferred lease incentives and stock based compensation 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the estimated tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 

table of contents we are also required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures and account for uncertain tax positions associated with our various filings 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations are often complex  ambiguous and change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions  tax authorities could assess tax liabilities greater or less than our accrued positions for open tax periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the following fiscal years net sales cost of sales including buying  distribution  and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income in the regular course of business  we offer our customers sales incentives including coupons  discounts  and free merchandise 
sales are recorded net of such incentives and returns and allowances 
if an incentive involves free merchandise  that merchandise is recorded as a zero sale and the cost is included in cost of sales 
comparable store sales for the periods indicated below include stores that have been open for full months prior to the beginning of the period  including those stores that have been relocated or remodeled 
therefore  stores opened or closed during the periods indicated are not included in comparable store sales nor are our e commerce sales 
our e commerce sales will be included in comparable sales starting with the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to net sales net sales increased million to million in fiscal  a increase over the prior year s net sales of million 
of this increase  million was attributable to the sales generated by the new stores we opened during fiscal  our e commerce business which was launched in the third quarter of fiscal along with the full year effect of sales generated by the ten stores we opened in fiscal our comparable stores sales increased for fiscal these increases in sales were partially offset by a decline in sales of million from the stores closed during fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  comparable store sales were negatively impacted by a decline in consumer demand within two key product areas  toning footwear and boots 
we were able to mitigate our year over year comparable store sales loss in toning footwear as sales within the balance of the athletic category  particularly performance running  remained strong 
however  the unseasonably warm weather that was experienced late in the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter of fiscal significantly impacted consumer demand for fall footwear  particularly boots 
consequently  heavy promotional activity  including markdowns  was required during the fourth quarter of fiscal to effectively sell through this inventory 

table of contents gross profit gross profit increased million to million in fiscal  a increase from gross profit of million in fiscal the gross profit margin for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal our merchandise margin decreased while buying  distribution and occupancy costs  as a percentage of sales  remained unchanged 
the decrease in our merchandise margin was primarily the result of the heavy promotional activity that was required during the fourth quarter of fiscal to effectively sell through our fall footwear  particularly boots 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  however  our sales gain enabled us to leverage these costs by as a percentage of sales 
significant changes in expense between the comparative periods included the following we incurred an additional million of incremental expense during fiscal  as compared to the prior year  to support our sales growth  expanded store base and e commerce initiative 
the increase in selling expenses was primarily due to increases in wages and advertising 
during fiscal  we experienced a significant decrease in the average cost of health claims per participant as compared to recent historical periods 
our average claims per participant returned to a more normalized level in fiscal and  together with a small increase in covered employees  we experienced a year over year increase in self insured health care costs of million 
costs related to our self insured health care programs are subject to a significant degree of volatility and will continue to carry the risk of material variances between reporting periods 
the increases in selling  general and administration expenses were partially offset by a million reduction in incentive compensation for fiscal as compared to the prior year when record breaking financial performance drove material increases in performance based compensation 
pre opening costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or as a percentage of sales  in fiscal  as compared to  or as a percentage of sales  in fiscal we opened stores during fiscal and ten stores in fiscal pre opening costs  such as advertising  payroll and supplies  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged in the period they are incurred 
the total amount of pre opening expense incurred will vary by store depending on the specific market and the promotional activities involved 
the portion of store closing costs and non cash asset impairment charges included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal was  or as a percentage of sales 
these costs related to the closing of four stores  non cash asset impairment of certain underperforming stores and acceleration of expenses associated with management s determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods 
in fiscal  we incurred store closing costs and non cash asset impairment charges of million  or as a percentage of sales 
these costs related to the closing of seven stores  non cash asset impairment of certain underperforming stores and acceleration of expenses associated with management s determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods 
the timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly depending  in part  on the period in which management commits to a closing plan  the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and the amount of any lease buyout 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal included in income tax expense for both fiscal years were benefits related to the favorable resolution of certain tax positions  which lowered our effective income tax rate as compared to other historical periods 

table of contents compared to net sales net sales increased million to million in fiscal  an increase from net sales of million in fiscal comparable store sales increased  or approximately million  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the ten stores opened in fiscal  along with the effect of a full year s worth of sales from the stores opened in fiscal  contributed an additional million in sales 
these sales increases were partially offset by a decline in sales of million from the stores that were closed during fiscal and fiscal gross profit gross profit increased million to million in fiscal  a increase from gross profit of million in fiscal the gross profit margin for fiscal increased to from in fiscal as a percentage of sales  the merchandise margin increased  primarily as a result of the strong sales of seasonal footwear 
buying  distribution and occupancy costs decreased  as a percentage of sales  due to the leverage associated with comparable store sales increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  however  our sales gain enabled us to leverage these costs by  as a percentage of sales 
while we were able to significantly leverage our store operating expenses as a percentage of sales  we did incur an additional million in store selling expenses as compared to the prior year 
the increase in store selling expenses was primarily due to increases in wages  advertising and credit and debit card processing fees  partially offset by a decrease in depreciation 
incentive compensation  inclusive of stock based compensation  increased million when compared to the prior year due to our improved financial performance 
also during fiscal  we recorded an additional million in store closing costs and non cash asset impairment charges related to certain underperforming stores 
the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were partially offset by a million decrease in our self insured health care costs as compared to the prior year when we experienced unusually high claim activity 
the costs related to our self insured health care programs are subject to a certain degree of volatility and can vary materially between reporting periods 
pre opening costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of sales  compared to  or of sales  in fiscal we opened ten stores in fiscal as compared to stores in fiscal pre opening costs  such as advertising  payroll and supplies  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense in the period they are incurred 
the total amount of pre opening expense incurred will vary by store depending on the specific market and the promotional activities involved 
our average pre opening costs per store increased by  to  in fiscal  primarily as a result of additional expenditures on marketing and supplies 
the portion of store closing costs and non cash asset impairment charges included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal was million  or as a percentage of sales 
these costs related to the closing of seven stores  the impairment of assets and acceleration of expenses associated with management s determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods 
in fiscal  we incurred  or as a percentage of sales 
these costs related to the closing of nine stores  the impairment of assets and acceleration of expenses associated with management s determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal included in income tax expense for fiscal was a  income tax benefit related to the favorable resolution of certain tax positions 
this cumulative benefit significantly lowered our effective income tax rate for fiscal as compared to the same period last year 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our sources and uses of cash are summarized as follows in thousands net income plus depreciation and amortization deferred income taxes lease incentives changes in operating assets and liabilities other operating activities net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents our primary sources of funds are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal these amounts reflect the income from operations adjusted for non cash items and working capital changes 
working capital increased to million at january  from million at january  this was primarily attributable to a million increase in cash and cash equivalents and a million increase in merchandise inventories  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable 
the current ratio was at january  and was at january  we had no outstanding interest bearing debt at the end of either fiscal year 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal no capital lease obligations were incurred during this three year period 
of the fiscal capital expenditures  approximately million was used for the construction of stores opened in fiscal and expected to open in the first quarter of fiscal  million was used for remodeling and relocations and million was used towards implementation of our e commerce business 
the remaining capital expenditures for fiscal were used for continued investments in technology and normal asset replacement activities 
lease incentives received from landlords were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
capital expenditures are expected to be million to million in fiscal approximately million of our total capital expenditures are expected to be used for new store construction  million will be used for store relocations and million will be used to remodel approximately of our existing store base 
lease incentives to be received from landlords are expected to be approximately million to million 
the remaining capital expenditures are expected to be incurred for various other store improvements  continued investments in technology and normal asset replacement activities 
the actual amount of cash required for capital expenditures for store operations depends in part on the number of new stores opened  the amount of lease incentives  if any  received from landlords and the number of stores remodeled 
the opening of new stores will be dependent upon  among other things  the availability of desirable locations  and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms and general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending in areas we target for expansion 
our current store prototype for stores located in the continental united states uses between  and  square feet depending upon  among other factors  the location of the store and the population base the store is expected to service 
capital invested in these fiscal new stores is expected to average approximately  with landlord incentives averaging  the average initial inventory investment is expected to range from  to  depending on the size and sales expectation of the store and the timing of the new store opening 
our new stores opening in puerto rico in fiscal are expected to be slightly larger with an initial inventory investment of up to million 
capital invested in these puerto rican stores is expected to average  with landlord incentives averaging  during fiscal  we anticipate opening approximately new stores and relocating ten store locations 

table of contents pre opening expenses  such as rent  freight  advertising  salaries and supplies  are expected to average approximately  per store in fiscal this represents an increase of  over our average fiscal expenditure and is primarily the result of the costs associated with entering two major new markets  dallas  texas and puerto rico 
on a per store basis  for the stores opened during fiscal  the initial inventory investment averaged  capital expenditures averaged  and lease incentives received from landlords averaged  we closed four stores during fiscal we have identified five stores for closure in fiscal depending upon the results of lease negotiations with certain landlords of underperforming stores  we may increase or decrease the number of store closures in future periods 
the timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly depending  in part  on the period in which management commits to a closing plan  the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and the amount of any lease buyout 
we will continue to review our annual store growth rate based on our view of the internal and external opportunities and challenges in the marketplace 
significant contractual obligations as of january  and the fiscal years in which payments are due include in thousands payments due by fiscal year contractual obligations total and after letters of credit operating leases purchase commitments unrecognized tax positions deferred compensation total contractual obligations our unsecured credit agreement provides for up to million in cash advances and commercial and standby letters of credit with borrowing limits based on eligible inventory 
it contains covenants which stipulate total shareholders equity  adjusted for the effect of any share repurchases  will not fall below that of the prior fiscal year end  the ratio of funded debt plus rent to ebitda plus rent will not exceed to  and cash dividends for a fiscal year will not exceed of consolidated net income for the immediately preceding fiscal year 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of january  should a default condition be reported  the lenders may preclude additional borrowings and call all loans and accrued interest at their discretion 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and letters of credit outstanding were million at january  estimated interest payments on our line of credit are not included in the above table as our line of credit provides for frequent borrowing and or repayment activities  which does not lend itself to reliable forecasting for disclosure purposes 
as of january   million was available to us for additional borrowings under the credit facility 
for purposes of our contractual obligations table above  we have assumed that we will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date 
we have disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended  whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement between us and the counterparty  due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension 
except for operating leases  the balances included in the and after column of the contractual obligations table includes amounts where we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the potential future payments 
see note long term debt  note leases  note income taxes and note employee benefit plans to our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report for a further discussion of our contractual obligations 
on august   our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program  which was to terminate upon the earlier of the repurchase of the maximum amount or december  on december   the board of directors extended the date of termination by one year to december  the purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions from time to time and in accordance with applicable laws  rules and regulations 
the program may be amended  suspended or discontinued at any time and does not commit us to repurchase shares of our common stock 
we intend to fund the share repurchase program from cash on hand and any shares acquired will be available for stock based compensation awards and other corporate purposes 
the actual number and value of the shares to be purchased will depend on the performance of our stock price and other market conditions 
as required by our credit agreement  consent was obtained from the agent and the majority banks  each as defined in the credit agreement 
no shares had been repurchased under this program as of january  
table of contents we anticipate that our existing cash and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our revolving credit line  will be sufficient to fund our planned store expansion along with other capital expenditures and other operating cash requirements for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not assign any store operating leases to separate third parties during fiscal we remain liable on two assignments of operating leases covering former store locations 
we believe that the likelihood of material liability being triggered under these leases is remote  and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations in our consolidated financial statements as of january  see note leases to our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report for further discussion 
except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business  including leases for stores and equipment  we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal or fiscal seasonality our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future  primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores 
non capital expenditures  such as advertising and payroll  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense as incurred 
therefore  our results of operations may be adversely affected in any quarter in which we incur pre opening expenses related to the opening of new stores 
we have three distinct peak selling periods easter  back to school and christmas 
new accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our operations are contained in note summary of significant accounting policies  contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in that the interest payable on our credit facility is based on variable interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market rates 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in market interest rates 
we had no borrowings under our credit facility during fiscal or fiscal
