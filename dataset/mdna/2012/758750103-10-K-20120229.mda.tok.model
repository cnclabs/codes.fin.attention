item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation we operate on a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to december we refer to the fiscal year ended december  as fiscal  the fiscal year ended january  as fiscal  the fiscal year ended january  as fiscal fiscal had weeks  fiscal had weeks and fiscal had weeks 
overview we are a global manufacturer of electric motors and controls  electric generators and controls  and mechanical motion control products 
we have two reporting segments electrical and mechanical 
our electrical products primarily include motors used in commercial and residential hvac applications  a full line of ac and dc commercial and industrial electric motors  electric generators and controls  high performance drives and controls  and capacitors 
our mechanical products primarily include gears and gearboxes  marine transmissions  manual valve actuators  and electrical connectivity devices 
over the past several years  as part of our strategic growth plans  we have typically acquired multiple businesses in any given fiscal year 
when we refer to the financial impact of the recently acquired businesses  we are referring to the results of operations of acquired businesses prior to the first anniversary of their acquisition 
on an ongoing basis  we focus on a variety of key indicators to monitor business performance 
these indicators include organic and total sales growth including volume and price components  gross profit margin  operating profit  net income and earnings per share  and measures to optimize the management of working capital  capital expenditures  cash flow and return on invested capital roic 
we monitor these indicators  as well as our corporate governance practices including our code of business conduct and ethics  to ensure that we maintain business health and strong internal controls 
to achieve our financial objectives  we are focused on initiatives to drive and fund growth 
we seek to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting customer product needs within our core product categories  developing new products  and identifying category expansion opportunities 
we meet these customer product needs through focused product research and development efforts as well as through a disciplined acquisition strategy 
our acquisition strategy emphasizes acquiring companies that offer market growth potential as a result of geographic base  technology or synergy opportunities 
the cash flow needed to fund our growth is developed through continuous  corporate wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization 
we also prioritize investments that generate higher return on capital businesses 
our management team is compensated based on a modified economic value added eva program which reinforces capital allocation disciplines that drive increases in shareholder value 
the key metrics in our program include total sales growth  organic sales growth  operating margin percent  operating cash flow as a percent of net income and roic 
given the global economic uncertainty  we anticipate that the near term operating environment will remain challenging 
specifically  we are experiencing continued volatility in the costs for commodity inputs  including copper  steel and aluminum  which are the primary materials used in manufacturing our products 
we are unable to predict the future costs of these commodities and continued increases in these costs may adversely affect our operating margins if we are unable to offset cost increases through price  productivity or other means

in addition to operating income  other significant factors affecting our operating cash flow include working capital levels  capital expenditures  dividends  acquisitions  availability of debt financing and the ability to attract long term capital at acceptable terms 
cash flow provided by operating activities operating cash flow was million for fiscal an million increase from fiscal the increase was driven by  a decrease in the level of trade receivables  inventories and accounts payable net of acquired working capital 
these working capital components provided million of operating cash in fiscal compared to using million in fiscal cash flow used in investing activities was million for fiscal  million more than in fiscal  driven by million of incremental acquisition costs 
in addition  capital spending increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal our commitments for property  plant and equipment as of december  were approximately million 
in fiscal  we anticipate capital spending will increase to approximately million as we fund the construction and relocation of two of our factories in china as required page 
table of contents by the chinese government  in addition to our normal capital spending 
we believe that our present manufacturing facilities  augmented by these planned capital expenditures in fiscal  will be sufficient to provide adequate capacity for our operations in we anticipate funding capital spending with a combination of operating cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
cash flow provided from financing activities was million for fiscal  compared to cash flow used of million for fiscal the increase is driven by million in long term borrowings used to finance a portion of the epc acquisition 
we paid million in dividends to shareholders in fiscal subsequent to year end  we acquired milwaukee gear company for cash consideration of million  funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
due to the date of the acquisition  the initial accounting is not yet complete 
our working capital was million at december   an increase of from million at year end at december   our current ratio which is the ratio of our current assets to current liabilities was compared to at january  the following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of december  and january  in millions december  january  cash and cash equivalents investments trading securities trade receivables  net inventories  net working capital our cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december  the majority of our cash held by foreign subsidiaries could be used in our domestic operations if necessary  but would be subject to taxes 
there are no current trends  demands or uncertainties that we believe are reasonably likely to require repatriation or to have a material impact on our ability to fund us operations 
at december   we had million of senior notes the notes outstanding 
during  we issued million in senior notes the notes in a private placement 
the notes were issued in seven tranches with maturities from seven to twelve years and carry fixed interest rates 
we also have million in senior notes the notes issued in two tranches with floating interest rates based on a margin over the london inter bank offered rate libor 
details on the senior notes at december  were in millions principal interest rate maturity floating rate series a floating august  floating rate series a floating august  fixed rate series a july  fixed rate series a to july  fixed rate series a to july  interest rates vary as libor varies 
at december   the interest rate was between and 
we have interest rate swap agreements to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk see also note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
on june   we entered into a term loan agreement term loan with certain financial institutions  pursuant to which we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of million 
during we repaid million of the outstanding term loan 
the term loan matures in june and borrowings generally bear funded interest at a variable rate equal to a margin over libor 
this margin varies with the ratio of our consolidated debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda as defined in the agreement 
these interest rates also vary as libor varies 
at december   the interest rate of was based on a margin over libor 
on june   we replaced an existing million revolving credit facility with a maturity of april with a new million revolving credit facility the facility 
at december  we had million outstanding on the facility 
the facility permits us to borrow at interest rates based upon a margin above libor  which margin varies with the ratio of total funded debt  net of specified cash  to ebitda as defined in the facility 
these interest rates also vary as libor varies 
at december  the interest rate of was based on a margin over libor 
we pay a commitment fee on the unused amount of the facility  which also varies with the ratio of our total funded debt to our ebitda  net of specified cash 
as of december   we had approximately million in standby letters of credit issued under the facility and million in available borrowings under the facility 
the average balance outstanding in direct borrowings under the facility in fiscal page 
table of contents was million 
the facility matures in june the notes  the term loan and the facility require us to meet specified financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial condition tests 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december  we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future 
as of january   we had no convertible notes outstanding 
during fiscal  the final million face value bonds were converted 
we paid the par value in cash and issued approximately million shares for the conversion premium 
as part of the acquisitions made during fiscal see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  we assumed million of short term and long term debt 
at december   million of the short term acquired debt remains outstanding and million of the long term acquired debt remains outstanding 
at january  one of our foreign subsidiaries had outstanding short term borrowings of million denominated in local currency with a fixed interest rate of 
at december   additional notes payable of approximately million were outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
at january   additional notes payable of approximately million were outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of our short term and long term debt obligations used to finance our operations and acquisitions 
at december   excluding the related interest rate swaps  we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt 
the variable rate debt is primarily under our notes and term loan with interests rate based on a margin above libor 
as a result  interest rate changes impact future earnings and cash flow assuming other factors are constant 
a hypothetical change in our weighted average borrowing rate on outstanding variable rate debt at december  would result in a change in net income of approximately million 
predominately all of our expenses are paid in cash  often with payment term provisions that include early payment discounts and time elements 
we believe that our ability to generate positive cash flow  coupled with our available revolving credit balance will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
we focus on optimizing our investment in working capital through improved and enforced payment terms and operational efficiencies 
additionally  we believe that our capital expenditures for maintenance of equipment and facilities will be consistent with prior levels and not present a funding challenge 
the primary financial covenants on our notes  term loan  and the facility include ratios of debt to ebitda as defined in each agreement and minimum interest coverage ratios of ebitda to interest expense 
the debt to ebitda covenant ratio requires us to be less than  and our ratio at december  was approximately the minimum interest coverage ratio requires us to be greater than  and our ratio at december  was approximately we will  from time to time  maintain excess cash balances which may be used to i fund operations  ii repay outstanding debt  iii acquire additional businesses or product lines  iv pay dividends  v make investments in new product development programs  vi repurchase our common stock  or vii fund other corporate objectives 
our projections are based on all information known to us  which may change based on global economic events  our financial performance  actions by our customers and competitors and other factors discussed in risk factors 
litigation one of our subsidiaries that we acquired in is subject to numerous claims filed in various jurisdictions relating to certain sub fractional motors that were primarily manufactured through and that were included as components of residential and commercial ventilation units marketed by a third party 
these claims generally allege that the ventilation units were the cause of fires 
based on the current facts  we do not believe these claims  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
however  we cannot predict the outcome of these claims  the nature or extent of remedial actions  if any  we may need to undertake with respect to motors that remain in the field  or the costs we many incur  some of which could be significant 
we are  from time to time  party to other litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations  including product warranty and liability claims  contract disputes and environmental  asbestos  employment and other litigation matters 
our products are used in a variety of industrial  commercial and residential applications that subject us to claims that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage 
we accrue for anticipated costs in defending against such lawsuits in amounts that we believe are adequate  and we do not believe that the outcome of any such lawsuit will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position

future pension obligation payments after are subject to revaluation based on changes in the benefit population and or changes in the value of pension assets based on market conditions that are not determinable as of december  variable rate debt based on december  rates 
we utilize blanket purchase orders blankets to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers 
requirements under blankets generally do not become firm until a varying number of weeks before our scheduled production 
the purchase obligations shown in the above table represent the value we consider firm 
at december   we had outstanding standby letters of credit totaling approximately million 
we had no other material commercial commitments 
we did not have any material variable interest entities as of december  and january  other than disclosed in the table above and the previous paragraph  we had no other material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results 
goodwill we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
when applying the accounting guidance  we use estimates to determine when it might be necessary to take an impairment charge 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or significant negative industry or economic trends 
we perform our required annual goodwill impairment test as of the end of the october fiscal month each year 
we use a weighting of the market approach guideline public company method  and the income approach discounted cash flow method in testing goodwill for impairment 
in the market approach  we apply performance multiples from comparable guideline public companies  adjusted for relative risk  profitability  and growth considerations  to our reporting units to estimate fair value 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method used to estimate fair value include discount rates  growth rates  cash flow projections and terminal value rates 
discount rates  growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment 
discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the wacc considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used 
the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 
terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and long term growth rates 
goodwill related to our acquisitions is supported by valuations performed as of the dates of the acquisition 
the calculated fair values for our impairment testing exceed the carrying values of the reporting units 
the two reporting units that comprise approximately of total consolidated goodwill of reporting units acquired prior to fiscal  had a combined excess of approximately estimated fair value over carrying value at december  we had two reporting units with a total of million of goodwill at december  that had an estimated fair value that was less than over carrying value 
intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of intangible assets whenever events or changes in page 
table of contents circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable through future cash flows 
when applying the accounting guidance we use estimates to determine when an impairment is necessary 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or significant negative or economic trends see also note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
derivatives we periodically enter into commodity hedging transactions to reduce the impact of changing prices for certain commodities such as copper and aluminum based upon forecasted purchases of such commodities 
we also use a cash flow hedging strategy to protect against an increase in the cost of forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions 
finally  we also have certain libor based floating rate borrowings that expose us to variability in interest rates that have been hedged by entering into a pay fixed receive libor based interest rate swap agreement 
the fair value of derivatives is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and the value is determined based on level inputs see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
retirement plans most of our domestic employees are participants in defined benefit pension plans and or defined contribution plans 
the defined benefit pension plans were closed to new employees as of january   and benefits under those plans were frozen for existing employees as of december  most of our foreign employees are covered by government sponsored plans in the countries in which they are employed 
our obligations under our defined benefit pension plans are determined with the assistance of actuarial firms 
the actuaries make certain assumptions regarding such factors as withdrawal rates and mortality rates 
the actuaries also provide information and recommendations from which management makes further assumptions on such factors as the long term expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate on benefit obligations and where applicable  the rate of annual compensation increases 
based upon the assumptions made  the investments made by the plans  overall conditions and movement in financial markets  particularly the stock market and how actual withdrawal rates  life spans of benefit recipients and other factors differ from assumptions  annual expenses and recorded assets or liabilities of these defined benefit pension plans may change significantly from year to year 
based on the annual review of actuarial assumptions as well as historical rates of return on plan assets and existing long term bond rates  we set the long term rate of return on plan assets at and used a discount rate ranging from to for our defined benefit pension plans as of december  see also note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various us federal  state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods 
our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction  the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters  our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 
additional information regarding income taxes is contained in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
further discussion of our accounting policies is contained in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk relating to our operations due to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices of purchased raw materials 
we manage the exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  commodity cash flow hedges and foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes 
all hedges are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and are accounted for as cash flow hedges  with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci in each accounting period 
an ineffective portion of the hedges change in fair value  if any  is recorded in earnings in the period of change 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of our short term and long term debt obligations used to finance our operations and acquisitions 
at december   excluding the impact of interest rate swaps  we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt 
at january   excluding the impact of page 
table of contents interest rate swaps  we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt 
increased borrowings in were largely used to finance a portion of the epc acquisition 
as a result  interest rate changes impact future earnings and cash flow assuming other factors are constant 
we utilize interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from exposure to interest rate risk on forecasted variable rate interest payments 
we have libor based floating rate borrowings  which expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical change in our weighted average borrowing rate on outstanding variable rate debt at december   would result in a change in after tax annualized earnings of approximately million 
we have entered into pay fixed receive libor based floating interest rate swaps to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk 
these interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges against forecasted libor based interest payments 
details regarding the instruments  as of december   are as follows instrument notional amount maturity rate paid rate received fair value loss swap million august  libor month million swap million august  libor month million as of december  and january   the interest rate swap liability of million and million  respectively  was included in hedging obligations 
the unrealized loss on the effective portion of the contracts of million and million  net of tax as of december  and january   respectively  was recorded in aoci 
foreign currency risk we are also exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations 
these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries  intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the utilization of foreign currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure on the forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 
contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
we do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to united states dollars

the net aoci balance related to hedging activities of million loss at december  includes million of net current deferred losses expected to be realized in the next twelve months 
counterparty risk we are exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance by the counterparties to various financial agreements  including our interest rate swap agreements  foreign currency exchange contracts and commodity hedging transactions 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by limiting our counterparties to major international banks and financial institutions meeting established credit guidelines and continually monitoring their compliance with the credit guidelines 
we do not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk 
we do not anticipate non performance by our counterparties  but cannot provide assurances
