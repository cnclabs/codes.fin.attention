special note regarding smaller reporting company status we are filing this annual report on form k as a smaller reporting company as defined in rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended because our public float the aggregate market value of our common equity held by non affiliates of the company was below the required threshold as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter of as a result of being a smaller reporting company  we are allowed and have elected to omit certain information from this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  however  we have provided all information for the periods presented that we believe to be appropriate 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods 
we base estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the application of these accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide timely and reliable financial information 
our critical accounting polices include the following inventories inventories include freight in  materials  labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates average cost or market 
allowances are recorded for slow moving  obsolete or unusable inventory 
we assess our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory and write down the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future sales and supply on hand  if necessary 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are recorded at the invoice amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the company s existing accounts receivable  however  changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
the company determines the allowance based upon historical write off experience and known conditions about customers current ability to pay 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
revenue recognition for sales transactions  we comply with the provisions of the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which states that revenue should be recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title transfers and the customer assumes the risk of loss  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are satisfied upon shipment of product  and revenues are recognized accordingly 
sales returns  rebates and allowances sales are reduced for any anticipated sales returns  rebates and allowances based on historical experience 
since our return policy is only days and our products are not generally susceptible to external factors such as technological obsolescence or significant changes in demand  we are able to make a reasonable estimate for returns 
we offer end user product specific and sales volume rebates to select distributors 
our rebates are based on actual sales and are accrued monthly 
stock based compensation alpha pro tech accounts for stock based awards using financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  stock compensation asc 
asc requires companies to record compensation expense for the value of all outstanding and unvested share based payments  including employee stock options and similar awards 
the fair values of stock option grants are determined using the black scholes merton option pricing model and are based on the following assumptions expected stock price volatility based on historical data and management s expectations of future volatility  risk free interest rates from published sources  years to maturity based on historical data and no dividend yield  as management currently has no intention to pay dividends in the near future 
the black scholes merton option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
in addition  the option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect their fair value

our product offering will continue to evolve in the launch of our icc es icc evaluation service approved rex wrap fortis non perforated breathable housewrap has been slower than anticipated  but the product is expected to start contributing more significantly to the sales line during the non perforated breathable housewrap market accounts for the majority of the total housewrap market  and this new product is expected to increase our housewrap sales and market share
