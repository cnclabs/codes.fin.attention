risk factors the company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results  and many of those risks are driven by factors that the company cannot control or predict 
the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant  although there may be other risks that could arise  or may prove to be more significant than expected  that may affect the company s operations or financial results 
for a discussion of the company s risk management  including technology and operating risk  credit risk  concentration risk  market risk  fiduciary risk  and legal and regulatory risk  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management 
developments in the business  economic  and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company s business 
the company s business can be adversely affected by the general environment economic  corporate  securities market  regulatory  and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations  trading activity  interest rates and overall investor engagement  and are outside of the company s control 
deterioration in the housing and credit markets  reductions in short term interest rates  and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact the company s net interest revenue  asset management and administration fees  and capital resources 
a significant decrease in the company s liquidity could negatively affect the company s business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in the company 
maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the company  including margin lending  mortgage lending  and transaction settlement  among other liquidity needs 
the company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings  as well as cash provided by external financing 
fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances  as well as changes in market conditions  may affect the company s ability to meet its liquidity needs 
a reduction in the company s liquidity position could reduce client confidence in the company  which could result in the loss of client accounts 
in addition  if the company s broker dealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines  regulators could limit the subsidiaries operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc  which could reduce csc s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends 
in addition  csc may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries 
factors which may adversely affect the company s liquidity position include a reduction in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts  a dramatic increase in the company s client lending activities including margin and personal lending  unanticipated outflows of company cash  increased capital requirements  other regulatory changes or a loss of market or customer confidence in the company 
schwab may also experience temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between clients transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances 
when cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for the company s liquidity needs  the company must seek external financing 
during periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets  potential sources of external financing could be reduced  and borrowing costs could increase 
although csc and schwab maintain committed and uncommitted  unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program  as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec  financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets 
in addition  a significant downgrade in the company s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets 

table of contents the charles schwab corporation the company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures 
the company s businesses are subject to the risk that a client  counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations  or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate 
while the company has policies and procedures designed to manage this risk  the policies and procedures may not be fully effective 
the company s exposure mainly results from margin lending activities  securities lending activities  mortgage lending activities  its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities  and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the company sponsors 
the company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios  which include us agency and non agency residential mortgage backed securities  consumer loan asset backed securities  corporate debt securities  us agency notes  and certificates of deposit among other investments 
these instruments are also subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market s assessment of issuer credit quality  increases in the unemployment rate  delinquency and default rates  housing price declines  changes in prevailing interest rates and other economic factors 
loss of value of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity can result in charges if management determines that the impairments are other than temporary 
the evaluation of whether other than temporary impairment exists is a matter of judgment  which includes the assessment of several factors 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates 
if management determines that a security is other than temporarily impaired  the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings 
certain securities available for sale experienced continued credit deterioration in  which resulted in impairment charges 
deterioration in the performance of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity could result in the recognition of future impairment charges 
the company s loans to banking clients primarily consist of first lien residential real estate mortgage loans and helocs 
increases in delinquency and default rates  housing price declines  increases in the unemployment rate  and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves and write downs on such loans 
heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments concentration risk can increase the company s risk of loss 
examples of the company s credit concentration risk include large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry  mortgage loans and helocs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region  and margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry 
the company may also be subject to concentration risk when lending to a particular counterparty  borrower or issuer 
the company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds 
although the company has no obligation to do so  the company may decide for competitive reasons to provide credit  liquidity or other support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity 
such support could cause the company to take significant charges and could reduce the company s liquidity 
if the company chose not to provide credit  liquidity or other support in such a situation  the company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected 
significant interest rate changes could affect the company s profitability and financial condition 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interest earning assets such as cash equivalents  short and long term investments  and mortgage and margin loans relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources including deposits in banking and brokerage accounts  short term borrowings  and long term debt 
changes in interest rates generally affect the interest earned on interest earning assets differently than the interest the company pays on its interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  certain funding sources do not bear interest and their cost therefore does not vary 
overall  the company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment  the company could be adversely affected by a decline in interest rates if the rates that the company earns on interest earning assets decline more than the rates 
table of contents the charles schwab corporation that the company pays on its funding sources  or if prepayment rates increase on the mortgages and mortgage backed securities that the company holds 
with the low interest rate environment  the company s revenue from interest earning assets has been declining more than the rates that the company pays on its funding sources 
the company may also be limited in the amount it can reduce interest rates on deposit accounts and still offer a competitive return 
to the extent the overall yield on certain schwab sponsored money market mutual funds falls to a level at or below the management fees on those funds  the company may waive a portion of its fee in order to continue providing some return to clients 
as a result of the low interest rate environment  the company has been waiving and may continue to waive a portion of its management fees for certain schwab sponsored money market mutual funds 
such fee waivers negatively impact the company s asset management and administration fees 
the company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not always be successful in defending itself against such claims or proceedings 
the financial services industry faces substantial litigation and regulatory risks 
the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business  including arbitrations  class actions and other litigation  some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages 
the company is also the subject of inquiries  investigations  and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies 
actions brought against the company may result in settlements  awards  injunctions  fines  penalties or other results adverse to the company including reputational harm 
even if the company is successful in defending against these actions  the defense of such matters may result in the company incurring significant expenses 
predicting the outcome of matters is inherently difficult  particularly where claims are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants  claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages  or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage 
a substantial judgment  settlement  fine  or penalty could be material to the company s operating results or cash flows for a particular future period  depending on the company s results for that period 
in market downturns  the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased
