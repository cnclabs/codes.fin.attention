item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk and insurance program 
failure to fund continued capital expenditures could adversely affect our properties 
our exploration  development  and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures especially in the case of our major development projects  such as the horizontal niobrara and marcellus shale drilling programs  gunflint  alen  tamar  and leviathan 
in addition  our consol carried cost obligation requires us to pay one third of consol s working interest share of certain future drilling and completion costs  up to approximately billion  generally during periods in which average henry hub natural gas prices are above per mmbtu 
major offshore projects have a long development cycle time  which means that development spending occurs for several years before the project begins producing and generating cash flow 
historically  we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations  our revolving bank credit facility  debt issuances  and occasional sales of non strategic assets 
future cash flows from operations are subject to a number of variables  such as the level of production from existing wells  prices of crude oil and natural gas  and our success in finding  developing and producing new reserves 
if revenues were to decrease as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices or decreased production  and or our access to debt or capital were limited  we would have a reduced ability to replace our reserves  resulting in lower production over time 
if our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to meet our obligations and fund our capital investment program  we may not be able to access capital markets on an economic basis to meet these requirements 
if we are not able to fund our capital expenditures  our ownership interests in some properties might be reduced or forfeited as a result

derivatives regulation included in current or proposed financial legislation and rulemaking could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act  which was passed by congress and signed into law in july  contains significant derivatives regulation  including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges and a requirement to post cash collateral commonly referred to as margin for such transactions 
the act provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end users  such as us  and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions 
the act requires the commodities futures and trading commission cftc to promulgate rules to define these terms  and final definitions will determine which entities will face additional requirements for clearing  trading and posting of margin 
however  the process is incomplete and we are unsure what the final definitions will be or how these definitions will apply to us 

table of contents we use crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our expected production in order to reduce the impact of commodity price uncertainty and enhance the predictability of cash flows relating to the marketing of our production and in support of our capital investment program 
we use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with anticipated debt issuances 
as commodity prices increase or interest rates decrease  our derivative liability positions increase  however  given our current investment grade status  none of our current derivative contracts require the posting of margin or similar cash collateral when there are changes in the underlying commodity prices or interest rates that are referred to in these contracts 
depending on the rules and definitions adopted by the cftc  we could be required to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our dealer counterparties for our derivative transactions 
a sudden  unexpected margin call triggered by rising commodity prices or falling interest rates would have an immediate negative impact on our business plan  forcing us to divert capital from exploration  development and production activities 
requirements to post cash collateral could not only cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our flexibility in using our cash and other sources of funds such as our credit facility  but could also cause us to incur additional debt 
in addition  a requirement for our counterparties to post cash collateral would likely result in additional costs being passed on to us  thereby decreasing the effectiveness of our hedges and our profitability 
in addition  the final cftc rules may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivative activities to a separate entity  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty 
increased banking regulation could result in reduced access to traditional sources of funding and limit our growth 
in response to the global economic crisis of  banking regulation has increased 
new regulation includes the basel iii rules issued by the basel committee on banking supervision and the final report of the uk s independent commission on banking also known as the vickers report 
these  and other potential regulations being considered by governing bodies in the us and other countries  are expected to impact the amount of capital required to be held by banks and the nature of such capital 
as a result  traditional lending practices could change  resulting in more restricted access to funds or reduced availability of funds at rates and terms we consider to be economic 
increased regulation could also negatively impact the project finance market  even for investment grade companies such as we are  and reduce our ability to obtain funding for the capital requirements of future major development projects  such as a potential lng project 
inability of us and or our partners to obtain financing could result in delay or cancellation of future development projects  thus limiting our growth and future cash flows 
slower global economic growth rates may materially adversely impact our operating results and financial position 
the recovery from the global economic crisis of and resulting recession has been slow and uneven 
market volatility and reduced consumer demand have increased economic uncertainty  and the current global economic growth rate is slower than what was experienced in the years leading up to the crisis 
a significant number of developed countries are constrained by long term structural government budget deficits and international financial markets and credit rating agencies are pressing for budgetary reform and discipline 
this need for fiscal discipline is balanced by calls for continuing government stimulus and social spending as a result of the impacts of the global economic crisis 
as major countries implement government fiscal reform  such measures if they are undertaken too rapidly  could further undermine economic recovery  reducing demand and slowing growth 
impacts of the crisis could spread to china and other emerging markets  which have fueled global economic development in recent years  slowing their growth rates  reducing demand  and resulting in further drag on the global economy 
global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources  including fossil fuels 
a lower future economic growth rate is likely to result in decreased demand growth for our crude oil and natural gas production 
a decrease in demand  notwithstanding impacts from other factors  could potentially result in lower commodity prices  which would reduce our cash flows from operations  our profitability and our liquidity and financial position 
we face various risks associated with current global populist movements 
during  due in part to the upheaval and uncertainty caused by global economic events including the financial crisis and resulting recession that began in  higher unemployment  and government austerity measures  populist movements have appeared worldwide 
populist movements are directed against perceived economic and social inequality 
for example  in  the occupy movement  originally directed against wall street in new york city  spread to other cities in the us and multiple countries 
the occupy movement generally is anti capitalism and anti business and has targeted global corporations including financial institutions 
during  demonstrators picketed at two ports on the us west coast  shutting down shipping terminals for up to hours in support of union workers 
in many situations  social media channels have been used to organize protestors quickly  making it more difficult to fully prepare for protest activities 
populist activities could result in the following increased regulation of our business  increased regulation of the banking industry  
table of contents increased corporate income taxes  and reduced access to shipping or other transportation services 
our need to incur costs associated with responding to these initiatives or complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for  could increase our costs of doing business  reduce our financial flexibility and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face various risks associated with the trend toward increased anti development activity 
opposition toward oil and gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in certain countries in the oecd  including the us  the uk and israel 
companies in the oil and gas industry  such as us  are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non governmental organizations regarding safety  human rights  environmental compliance and business practices 
anti development activists are working to  among other things  reduce access to federal and state government lands  delay or cancel certain projects such as offshore drilling  shale development  and pipeline construction  and limit or ban the use of hydraulic fracturing 
for example  environmental activists have challenged decisions to grant air quality permits for offshore drilling and have advocated for increased regulations on shale drilling and hydraulic fracturing in the us 
in addition  the use of social media channels can be used to cause rapid  widespread reputational harm 
future activist efforts could result in the following delay or denial of drilling permits  shortening of lease terms or reduction in lease size  restrictions on installation or operation of gathering or processing facilities  restrictions on the use of certain operating practices  such as hydraulic fracturing  reduced access to water supplies or restrictions on water disposal  limited access or damage to or destruction of our property  legal challenges or lawsuits  increased regulation of our business  damaging publicity about us  increased costs of doing business  reduction in demand for our products  and other adverse effects on our ability to develop our properties and expand production 
our need to incur costs associated with responding to these initiatives or complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face significant competition and many of our competitors have resources in excess of our available resources 
we operate in the highly competitive areas of crude oil and natural gas exploration  exploitation  acquisition and production 
we face intense competition from large multi national  integrated oil companies  state controlled national oil companies  us independent oil and gas companies  service companies engaging in exploration and production activities  and private oil and gas equity funds 
we face competition in a number of areas such as seeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration  marketing our crude oil and natural gas production  seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise necessary to operate and develop properties  and attracting and retaining employees with certain skills 
many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us 
such companies may be able to pay more for seismic and lease rights on crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
this highly competitive environment could have an adverse impact on our business 

table of contents our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the fiscal regimes and government policies and regulation of oil and gas development in the countries in which we operate 
fiscal regimes impact oil and gas companies through laws and regulations governing royalties  taxes  resource access  or level of government participation in oil and gas projects 
we operate in the us and other countries whose fiscal regimes may change over time 
for example  in in the uk and israel  we witnessed higher tax rates applicable to our operations 
changes in fiscal regimes result in an increase or decrease in the amount of government take  and a corresponding decrease or increase in the revenues of an oil and gas company operating in that particular country 
many countries are currently experiencing fiscal problems  sustained structural government budget deficits and lower tax revenues triggered by the lingering effects of the global economic crisis of  associated recession and current slower economic growth rates 
higher unemployment and slower growth rates  coupled with a reduced tax base  have resulted in reduced government revenues  while government expenditures continue to grow due to the costs of entitlements  subsidies and economic stimulus programs 
many countries have generated significant budget deficits and sovereign debt levels with some approaching insolvency 
demands on certain governments to undertake austerity measures in response to the european debt crisis have resulted in increased social unrest 
due to pressures from financial markets  local constituents as well as the oecd to address these negative fiscal situations and initiate deficit reduction measures  many governments are seeking additional revenue sources  including increases in government take from oil and gas projects 
for example  the american jobs act of american jobs act  proposed by the president of the united states  contains various measures  including tax increases and other revenue raising proposals  designed to reduce the federal deficit by trillion 
if enacted as proposed  these measures would increase the tax expense on oil and gas companies through the repeal of percentage depletion for oil and natural gas properties  the deferral of expensing intangible drilling and development costs  the inability to expense costs of certain domestic production activities  and a lengthening of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures 
it is likely that some of these proposals to increase taxes on the oil and gas industry will continue to be reviewed by the us congress in future years 
in israel  the interministerial committee to examine government policy on israel s natural gas economy has been charged with the task of proposing a government policy for developing the natural gas economy in israel 
objectives include ensuring energy security for the economy  encouraging competition among various sectors in the local economy  and generating economic and political benefits for israel 
among other things  the interministerial committee will examine the best policy for safeguarding reserves to provide for local consumption and for exporting natural gas 
the interministerial committee is expected to present its recommendations by february  we are monitoring the activities of the interministerial committee to assess the possible impact any recommendations could have on our business 
certain change in israel s market  fiscal  and or regulatory regimes occurring as a result of interministerial committee recommendations could delay or reduce the profitability of our tamar and or leviathan projects and render future exploration and development projects uneconomic 
during  the israeli antitrust commissioner initiated review of the israeli domestic gas market and participation in offshore blocks and leases 
the commissioner has publically expressed concerns regarding ownership concentration on exploration blocks and development projects and its potential impacts on a competitive natural gas price environment and end user electricity costs 
we are cooperating with the commission s review and  at this time  cannot predict the outcome 
restrictions on resource access or controls over pricing could have a negative impact on our business including reduction on future growth rates  profitability and cash flows 
changes in fiscal regimes have long term impacts on our business strategy  and uncertainty makes it more difficult to formulate capital investment programs 
the implementation of new  or the modification of existing  laws or regulations impacting the amount of government take could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways  among others restrict resource access or lease holding reduce exploration activities  which could have a long term negative impact on the quantities of proved reserves we record and inhibit future production growth  have a negative impact on the ability of us and or our partners to obtain project financing  cause delay in or cancellation of development plans  which could also have a long term negative impact on the quantities of proved reserves we record and inhibit future production growth  reduce the profitability of our projects  resulting in decreases in net income and cash flows with the potential to make future investments uneconomical  result in current projects becoming uneconomic  to the extent fiscal changes are retroactive  thereby reducing the amount of proved reserves we record and cash flows we receive  and possibly resulting in asset impairment charges  require that valuation allowances be established against deferred tax assets  with offsetting increases in income tax expense  resulting in decreases in net income  restrict our ability to compete with imported volumes of crude oil or natural gas  and or adversely affect the price of our common stock 

table of contents we are subject to increasing governmental regulations and environmental requirements that may cause us to incur substantial incremental costs 
from time to time  in varying degrees  political developments and federal and state laws and regulations affect our operations 
in particular  price controls  taxes and other laws relating to the crude oil and natural gas industry  changes in these laws and changes in administrative regulations have affected and in the future could affect crude oil and natural gas production  operations and economics 
we cannot predict how agencies or courts will interpret existing laws and regulations or the effect these adoptions and interpretations may have on our business or financial condition 
our business is subject to laws and regulations promulgated by international  federal  state and local authorities relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and marketing of  crude oil and natural gas  as well as safety matters 
legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
we may be required to make substantial expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations 
our operations are subject to complex international  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations including  for example  in the case of federal laws  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended  the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended  the oil pollution act of  the clean air act  the clean water act and the occupational safety and health act 
environmental laws and regulations change frequently and the implementation of new  or the modification of existing  laws or regulations could negatively impact our operations 
the discharge of natural gas  crude oil  or other pollutants into the air  soil or water may give rise to substantial liabilities on our part to government agencies and third parties and may require us to incur substantial costs of remediation 
in addition  we may incur costs and penalties in addressing regulatory agency procedures involving instances of possible non compliance 
see items and business and properties regulations 
federal or state hydraulic fracturing legislation could increase our costs or restrict our access to oil and gas reserves 
hydraulic fracturing using fluids other than diesel is currently exempt from regulation under the federal safe drinking water act  but opponents of hydraulic fracturing have called for further study of the technique s environmental effects and  in some cases  a moratorium on the use of the technique 
several proposals have been submitted to congress that  if implemented  would subject all hydraulic fracturing to regulation under the safe drinking water act 
further  the epa s office of research and development ord is conducting a scientific study to investigate the possible relationships between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water 
the ord expects to have the initial study results available by late several states are considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices  including restrictions on its use in environmentally sensitive areas 
some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities  or are considering doing so 
although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the ord s study or the requirements of any additional federal or state legislation or regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing  any new federal or state  or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business  such as the dj basin or marcellus shale areas  could significantly increase our operating  capital and compliance costs as well as delay or halt our ability to develop oil and gas reserves 
see items and business and properties hydraulic fracturing 
the adoption of ghg emission or other environmental legislation could result in additional operating costs  create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities  and reduce demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce 
in recent years  each house of congress has considered legislation to address ghg emissions  such as the american clean energy and security act of  also known as the waxman markey bill  passed by the house of representatives  and the clean energy jobs and american power act  or the boxer kerry bill  introduced to the senate 
future legislation could include mandatory carbon dioxide emissions goals  measures to encourage use of renewable energy over fossil based fuels  higher penalties and fines for violations of various environmental laws  or other regulations designed to curb ghg emissions 
one measure considered frequently has been the establishment of a cap and trade system for restricting ghg emissions in the us 
under such system  certain sources of ghg emissions would be required to obtain ghg emission allowances corresponding to their annual emissions of ghgs 
the number of emission allowances issued each year would decline as necessary to meet overall emission reduction goals 
as the number of ghg emission allowances declines each year  the cost or value of allowances would be expected to escalate significantly 
the epa issued ghg monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect january   and  as amended  required reporting by regulated facilities by september  and annually thereafter 
beyond measuring and reporting  the epa issued an endangerment finding under section a of the clean air act  concluding ghg pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations 
the epa has issued final regulations requiring petroleum and natural gas operators meeting a certain emissions threshold to report their ghg emissions to the epa subpart w 
the epa has indicated that it will use data collected through the reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future ghg limits 

table of contents since approximately of our total crude oil and ngl production and of our total natural gas production derive from the us  any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of us ghgs could require us to incur additional operating costs  increase our development cycle time  and have an adverse effect on demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce 
in addition  we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with new environmental legislation  which would cause us to divert capital from exploration  development and production activities 
a change in us energy policy can have a significant impact on our operations and profitability 
us energy policy and laws and regulations could change quickly 
currently  substantial uncertainty exists about the nature of potential rules and regulations that could impact the sources and uses of energy in the us 
we design our exploration and development strategy and related capital investment programs years in advance 
as a result  we are hindered in our ability to plan  invest and respond to potential changes in our business 
this can result in a reduction of our cash flows and profitability to the extent we are unable to respond to sudden or significant changes in our operating environment due to changes in us energy policy 
exploration  development and production risks and natural disasters could result in liability exposure or the loss of production and revenues 
our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling  production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas  including injuries and or deaths of employees  supplier personnel  or other individuals  pipeline ruptures and spills  fires  explosions  blowouts and well cratering  equipment malfunctions and or mechanical failure on high volume  high impact wells  leaks or spills occurring during the transfer of hydrocarbons from an fpso to an oil tanker  formations with abnormal pressures and basin subsidence  release of pollutants  surface spillage of  or contamination of groundwater by  fluids used in hydraulic fracturing operations  security breaches  piracy  or terroristic acts  theft of oilfield equipment and supplies  especially in areas of increased activity such as the dj basin and marcellus shale  hurricanes which could affect our operations in areas such as the gulf coast and deepwater gulf of mexico  and cyclones  which could affect our operations offshore china  volcanoes which could affect our operations offshore equatorial guinea  flooding  such as occurred in pennsylvania in  which could affect our operations in low lying areas such as the marcellus shale  and other natural disasters 
any of these can result in loss of hydrocarbons  environmental pollution and other damage to our properties or the properties of others 
a cyber incident could result in information theft  data corruption  operational disruption  and or financial loss 
businesses have become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day to day operations 
at the same time  cyber incidents  including deliberate attacks or unintentional events  have increased 
a cyber attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information  corrupting data  or causing operational disruption  or result in denial of service on websites 
the oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration  development and production activities 
for example  software programs are used to interpret seismic data  manage drilling rigs  production equipment and gathering and transportation systems  conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation  and for compliance reporting 
the use of mobile communication devices has increased rapidly 
the complexity of the technologies needed to extract oil and gas in increasingly difficult physical environments  such as deepwater  ultra deepwater and shale  and global competition for oil and gas resources make certain information more attractive to thieves 
we depend on digital technology  including information systems and related infrastructure  to process and record financial and operating data  communicate with our employees and business partners  analyze seismic and drilling information  estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves and for many other activities related to our business 
our business partners  including vendors  service providers  purchasers of our production and financial institutions  are also dependent on digital technology 
our technologies  systems  networks  and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release  gathering  monitoring  misuse  loss or destruction of proprietary and other information  or other disruption of our business operations 
in addition  certain cyber incidents  such as surveillance  may remain undetected for an extended period 

table of contents a cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure  or that of our business partners  could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways  among others unauthorized access to seismic data  reserves information or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources  data corruption  communication interruption  or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in a dry hole cost or even drilling incidents  data corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure could result in loss of production or accidental discharge  a cyber attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt one of our major projects  effectively delaying the start of cash flows from the project  a cyber attack on a third party gathering or pipeline service provider could prevent us from marketing our production  resulting in a loss of revenues  a cyber attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading  thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities  resulting in a loss of revenues  a cyber attack which halts activities at a power generation facility or refinery using natural gas as feed stock could have a significant impact on the natural gas market  resulting in reduced demand for our production  lower natural gas prices  and reduced revenues  a cyber attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues  and a deliberate corruption of our financial or operational data could result in events of non compliance which could lead to regulatory fines or penalties  significant business interruptions could result in expensive remediation efforts  distraction of management  damage to our reputation  or a negative impact on the price of our common stock 
although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks  there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future 
as cyber threats continue to evolve  we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 
estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are not precise 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their value  including factors that are beyond our control 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
in accordance with the sec s revisions to rules for oil and gas reserves reporting  which we implemented effective december   our reserves estimates are based on month average prices  therefore  reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease 
the reserves estimates depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results  including historical production from the area compared with production from other areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies  including the impact of the sec s revisions to oil and gas company reserves reporting requirements  assumptions concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices  anticipated development cycle time  future development costs  future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  and workover and remedial costs 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of those reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different petroleum engineers or by the same petroleum engineers but at different times may vary substantially 
estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves in emerging areas or areas with limited historical production  such as onshore us shale areas and offshore areas such as ultra deepwater gulf of mexico  the eastern mediterranean or west africa  is inherently more difficult  and we may have less experience in such areas 
accordingly  reserves estimates may be subject to positive or negative revisions  and actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary  possibly materially  from estimates 
additionally  because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis  those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history 
volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure 
in addition  realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans 
a change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved 
see items and business and properties proved reserves disclosures 

table of contents exploratory drilling may not result in the discovery of commercially productive reservoirs 
we depend on exploration success to provide growth in production and reserves and are planning an active exploratory drilling program in exploratory drilling requires significant capital investment and is not always successful 
for example  we incurred dry hole expense in because the kora and bwabe exploratory wells offshore west africa found noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons 
exploratory dry holes can occur because seismic data and other technologies we use to determine potential exploratory drilling locations do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically 
exploratory drilling activities may be curtailed  delayed or canceled  resulting in significant exploration expense  as a result of a variety of factors  including title problems  compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements  increases in the cost of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  drilling rigs  equipment and qualified personnel  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or other irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  and adverse weather conditions 
in addition  companies seeking new reserves often face more difficult environments  such as oil sands  deepwater  or ultra deepwater  and often need to develop or invest in new technologies 
this increases cost as well as drilling risk 
for certain capital intensive deepwater gulf of mexico or international projects  it may take several years to evaluate the future potential of an exploration well and make a determination of its economic viability  resulting in delays in cash flows from production start up and a lower return on our investment 
due to our level of planned exploration activity  future dry hole cost could be significant and have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
development drilling may not result in commercially productive quantities of oil and gas reserves 
our exploration success has provided us with a number of major development projects on which we are moving forward 
we depend on these projects to provide long life  sustained cash flows after investment and attractive financial returns 
however  development drilling is not always successful and the profitability of development projects may change over time 
for example  in new development areas such as the marcellus shale  gunflint  tamar  leviathan or cyprus  available data may not allow us to completely know the extent of the reservoir or choose the best locations for drilling development wells 
therefore  a development well we drill may be a dry hole or result in noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons 
projects in frontier areas may require the development of special technology for development drilling or well completion and we may not have the knowledge or expertise in applying new technology 
our efforts may result in a dry hole or a well that finds noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons 
development drilling has the same legal and physical risks as exploratory drilling  described above  which can result in the drilling of a development dry hole or the incurrence of substantial development costs without a corresponding increase in proved reserves 
all costs of development drilling and other development activities are capitalized  even if the activities do not result in commercially productive quantities of oil and gas reserves 
this puts a property at higher risk for future impairment if commodity prices decrease or operating or development costs increase 
even if development drilling is successful and we find commercial quantities of reserves  we may encounter difficulties or delays in completing development wells 
for example  in areas of high activity and demand in which we concentrate  such as the dj basin and the marcellus shale  we may experience delays in obtaining well completion rigs and services 
frontier areas may not have adequate infrastructure for gathering  processing or transportation  and production may be delayed until they are constructed 
this results in a decrease in current cash flows and reduces the return on our investment 
costs of drilling  completing and operating wells are often uncertain  and cost factors can adversely affect the economic viability of a project 
even a development project with significant reserves that is currently economically viable can become uneconomic in the future if commodity prices decrease or operating or development costs increase  resulting in impairment charges and a negative impact on our results of operations 
we may be unable to make attractive acquisitions  successfully integrate acquired businesses and or assets  or adjust to the effects of divestitures  causing a disruption to our business 
one aspect of our business strategy calls for acquisitions of businesses and assets that complement or expand our current business  such as our marcellus shale acquisition in and our dj basin asset acquisition in this may present greater risks for us than those faced by peer companies that do not consider acquisitions as a part of their business strategy 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities 
even if we do identify attractive opportunities  we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to complete the acquisition due to capital market constraints  even if such capital is available on commercially acceptable terms 
if we acquire an additional business  we could have difficulty integrating its operations  systems  management and other personnel and technology with our own  or could assume unidentified or unforeseeable liabilities  resulting in a loss of value 

table of contents we maintain an ongoing portfolio management program which includes sales of non core  non strategic assets  such as the sales of non core onshore us assets in these transactions can also result in changes in operations  systems  or management and other personnel 
organizational modifications due to acquisitions  divestitures or other portfolio management actions  or other strategic changes can alter the risk and control environments  disrupt ongoing business  distract management and employees  increase expenses and adversely affect results of operations 
even if these challenges can be dealt with successfully  we cannot provide assurance that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition  divestiture or other strategic change would be realized 
we may be unable to dispose of non core  non strategic assets on financially attractive terms  resulting in reduced cash proceeds and or losses 
we maintain an ongoing portfolio management program according to which we may divest non core  non strategic assets  such as our sale of certain onshore us assets in asset divestitures can generate organizational and operational efficiencies as well as cash for use in our capital investment program or to repay outstanding debt 
as a result of the marcellus shale acquisition  which effectively focused our us operations in three core areas  we are considering the divestiture of certain onshore us assets from our portfolio 
we strive to obtain the most attractive prices for our assets 
however  various factors can materially affect our ability to dispose of assets on terms acceptable to us 
such factors include current commodity prices  laws and regulations impacting oil and gas operations in the areas where the assets are located  willingness of the purchaser to assume certain liabilities such as asset retirement obligations  our willingness to indemnify buyers for certain matters  and other factors 
inability to achieve a desired price for the assets  or underestimation of amounts of retained liabilities or indemnification obligations  can result in a reduction of cash proceeds  a loss on sale due to an excess of the asset s net book value over proceeds  or liabilities which must be settled in the future at amounts that are higher than we had expected 
the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  other oil field services and personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget 
our industry is cyclical and  from time to time  there is a shortage of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies and oilfield services 
there may also be a shortage of trained and experienced personnel 
during these periods  the costs of such items are substantially greater and their availability may be limited  particularly in areas of high activity and demand in which we concentrate  such as the dj basin  marcellus shale  deepwater gulf of mexico  and in some international locations that typically have limited availability of equipment and personnel  such as west africa and the eastern mediterranean 
during periods of increasing levels of industry exploration and production  such as is currently occurring in the dj basin and marcellus shale  the demand for  and cost of  drilling rigs and oilfield services increases 
the recovery of global crude oil prices during is resulting in increased global exploration and production activity  thus increasing demand pressure for drilling rigs and oilfield services  which could result in sector inflation 
in addition  regulatory changes  such as in response to the deepwater horizon incident or related to hydraulic fracturing  may also result in reduced availability and or higher costs for these rigs and services 
as a result  drilling rigs and oilfield services may not be available at rates that provide a satisfactory return on our investment 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations 
we operate in a litigious environment 
we operate in the us and some other countries which have proven to be litigious environments 
most oil and gas companies  such as us  are involved in various legal proceedings  such as title  royalty  or contractual disputes  in the ordinary course of business 
we defend ourselves vigorously in all such matters 
because we maintain a diversified portfolio of assets that is balanced between us and international projects  the complexity and types of legal procedures with which we may become involved may vary  and we could incur significant legal and support expenses in different jurisdictions 
if we are not able to successfully defend ourselves  there could be a delay or even halt in our exploration  development or production activities or other business plans  resulting in a reduction in reserves  loss of production and reduced cash flows 
legal proceedings could result in a substantial liability 
in addition  legal proceedings distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities 

table of contents provisions in our certificate of incorporation and delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us 
under our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors is authorized to issue shares of our common or preferred stock without approval of our shareholders 
issuance of these shares could make it more difficult to acquire us without the approval of our board of directors as more shares would have to be acquired to gain control 
in addition  delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
these provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of us that would have been financially beneficial to our shareholders
