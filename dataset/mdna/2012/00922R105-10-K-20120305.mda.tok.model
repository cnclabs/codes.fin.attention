item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis has been prepared with reference to the historical financial condition and results of operations of air transport services group  inc  and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors in item a of this report  our historical financial statements  and the related notes contained in this report 
background air transport services group  inc the company is a holding company whose principal subsidiaries include three independently certificated airlines  abx air  inc abx  capital cargo international airlines  inc ccia and air transport international  llc ati  and an aircraft leasing company  cargo aircraft management  inc cam 
at december   the company s in service aircraft fleet consisted of owned aircraft  one of which is a passenger aircraft  and five leased cargo aircraft 
additionally  the company owned four other aircraft that were being are modified to standard freighter aircraft and two more aircraft that were being modified into combi aircraft as of december  the company has two reportable segments acmi services  which primarily includes the cargo transportation operations of its three airlines and cam  which includes the company s aircraft leasing business 
the company s other business operations  which primarily provide support services to the transportation industry  include aircraft maintenance  aircraft part sales  ground equipment leasing and mail handling services 
these operations do not constitute reportable segments due to their size 
the company s largest customer is dhl network operations usa  inc and its affiliates dhl  which accounted for of the company s consolidated revenues in both and and of the company s consolidated revenues in the company has had long term contracts with dhl since august of commencing march   the company and dhl executed new commercial agreements under which dhl committed to lease boeing freighter aircraft from cam and contracted with abx to operate those aircraft under a separate crew  maintenance and insurance cmi agreement 
the cmi agreement pricing is based on pre defined fees  scaled for the number of aircraft operated and the number of flight crews provided to dhl for its us network 
the initial term of the cmi agreement is five years and the terms of the aircraft leases are seven years  with early termination provisions 
through december   cam leased all boeing aircraft to dhl 
in addition to the cam owned boeing aircraft  abx also operates four dhl owned boeing aircraft under the cmi agreement 
prior to the cmi and dhl lease agreements  abx provided flight crews  maintenance and aircraft to dhl under an aircraft  crew  maintenance and insurance agreement dhl acmi agreement which compensated abx on a cost plus mark up basis 
the follow on agreements separate cam s lease of freighter aircraft to dhl from the maintenance and operation of those aircraft by abx on behalf of dhl 
the us military comprised  and of the company s consolidated revenues in  and  respectively 
the company s airlines contract their services to the air mobility command amc  which is organized under the us military 
ati contracts its unique fleet of mcdonnell douglas dc combi aircraft to the amc 
the combi aircraft are capable of carrying passengers and cargo containers on the main flight deck 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues and cash flows have historically been derived from providing airlift in north america to bax global  inc  an affiliate of db schenker bax schenker 
bax schenker is a specialized heavy weight  business to business shipper 
under their agreements with bax schenker  ati and ccia had the right to be the exclusive providers of main deck freighter lift for bax schenker in the us the company started with eight boeing and eight dc aircraft dedicated to supporting the bax schenker network in north america 
however  on july   bax schenker announced its plans to adopt a new operating model that phased out the dedicated air cargo network in north america supported by the company 
instead of dedicated aircraft  bax schenker now utilizes dhl and other delivery services for its air transportation delivery requirements 
to execute the plan  on september   bax schenker ceased air cargo operations at its air hub in toledo  ohio and began to conduct air operations from the cincinnati northern kentucky airport  utilizing dhl s us air hub 
the company provided limited airlift directly to bax schenker through the peak delivery season  until late december  beginning in january  the company contracted with dhl to supplement its us air network to service bax schenker freight volumes on dhl s expanded air network without use of atsg s dc aircraft and with only limited use of boeing aircraft 

table of contents triggered by bax schenker s july decision  we tested the carrying value of the company s aircraft  engines  aircraft spare parts  goodwill and other intangibles during the third quarter of during the third quarter of  we recorded pre tax impairment charges totaling million to reduce the carrying values of the company s boeing and dc freighters  goodwill and customer relationship intangible assets to their individual fair values 
the lower fair value of these aircraft and bax schenker s july decision to terminate its dedicated air network are the result of prolonged recessionary conditions and trends toward higher fuel prices 
demand for boeing and dc aircraft has diminished in recent years  because these older aircraft are less fuel efficient and generally not as reliable as more modern aircraft 
the company s revenues from the services performed for bax schenker  derived primarily by providing boeing and dc airlift  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s revenues from bax schenker comprised approximately  and of the company s total revenues during the years ended december   and  respectively  and of total revenues excluding directly reimbursable revenues  respectively 
results of operations summary the consolidated net earnings from continuing operations were million and million for and  respectively 
the pre tax earnings from continuing operations for were million  inclusive of asset impairment charges and interest rate derivative losses during  compared to pre tax earnings of million in  in which no impairment charges or derivative losses were recorded 
the decline in earnings from continuing operations in as compared to resulted primarily from the recognition of asset impairment charges of million  interest rate derivative losses of million and the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the refinancing of the company s debt in adjusted pre tax earnings from continuing operations  a non gaap measure see reconciliation table below  after removing impairment charges  net derivative losses and charges related to debt refinancing was million for compared to million for after removing pre tax earnings related to dhl s restructuring 
this improved earnings  as adjusted  over  was driven primarily by cam  which placed five additional aircraft under external customer leases since december  the company s impairment charges stemming from bax schenker s transition to a new us business model are described below million million after income tax benefit to write down boeing and dc freighters  engines and related parts to their appraised fair values 
in light of bax schenker s decision to phase out its dedicated air network in the us and after evaluating business prospects for these aircraft  management has decided to discontinue the service of boeing and dc freighters sooner than previously expected 
million million after income tax benefit to write down customer relationship intangible assets  reflecting the closure of bax schenker s dedicated air network 
million million after income tax benefit to write down goodwill acquired when the company purchased ati  which operated the dc aircraft for bax schenker 
the write down reflects the lower forecasted cash flows in the near term as ati re fleets by replacing the dc aircraft operated for bax schenker with more efficient boeing and aircraft to be operated for other customers 
during  the company executed a new credit facility with a consortium of banks credit facility 
the new credit facility refinanced the company s previous term loan and provides liquidity to expand the company s aircraft fleet through april the new credit facility includes a term loan of million and a million revolving credit facility  of which the company has drawn million  net of repayments 
in conjunction with the execution of the new credit facility  the company terminated its previous credit agreement  which resulted in the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with that credit agreement and the recognition of million of losses for certain interest rate swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments stemming from the former term loan

cam also leased one additional boeing freighter aircraft to a miami  florida  based operator in during  cam completed the modification of its first two boeing freighter aircraft and leased the aircraft internally to its affiliate  ati  which began to operate the aircraft for customers under acmi agreements 
during  we plan to further invest in the modification of boeing and aircraft 
the fuel efficiency  cubic capacity  payload and operating costs of the boeing  make it a desirable freighter aircraft in medium range international air cargo markets and in certain transcontinental routes 
additionally  existing customers have requested boeing aircraft 
as these aircraft are modified  we plan to place them into service under dry leasing arrangements to external customers or acmi operations using our airlines  depending on which alternative provides the best long term return and considering other factors  including geographical placement and customer diversification 
additional information about our aircraft acquisition and modifications plans can be found below under commitments 
acmi services segment as of december   acmi services included in service aircraft  including leased internally from cam  five leased from external providers and cam owned freighter aircraft which were under lease to dhl and operated by abx under the cmi agreement

during  ati leased two boeing aircraft from cam and began to operate the aircraft under acmi agreements 
also in december  ccia began to operate a boeing aircraft under an acmi agreement 
acmi services revenues were million and million during and  respectively 
revenues from airline services increased during compared to  driven by higher block hours flown for customers 
aircraft block hours flown for customers increased during the year  however  block hours for customers other than bax schenker increased in compared to this increase in block hours reflects the additional boeing aircraft placed into service during  as described above 
reimbursable revenues increased million during  compared to the comparison of airline services revenues and reimbursable revenues to reflects the new commercial agreements between abx and dhl which became effective in april airline services revenues for the first quarter of included compensation based on aircraft depreciation and certain maintenance expenses under the former cost plus dhl acmi agreement 
beginning in april  lease revenues for the dhl network aircraft have been reflected in cam s revenues  while compensation for certain aircraft related maintenance costs have been reflected as reimbursable revenues 
revenues from activities under the s r agreement declined by million during compared to  due to the termination of the s r agreement in march acmi services incurred a pre tax loss of million during due to asset impairment charges of million 
the pre tax earnings for acmi services  excluding asset impairment charges  were million from airline services for compared to million from airline services during operating results during were negatively impacted by the phase out of bax schenker s north american air network  unscheduled aircraft downtime  start up costs for new boeing passenger operations and reductions in revenues from us military charters 
as a 
table of contents result of unscheduled aircraft maintenance events  revenue flights were missed and higher operating expenses were incurred during the aircraft downtime 
some of the downtime affected dc combi aircraft and boeing freighters operating in remote regions that were difficult to service 
revenues from the us military declined million during compared to due to maintenance related cancellations and contractual rate reductions 
the results for were impacted by start up costs incurred by ati in order for it to gain passenger authority and operate passenger routes under an acmi agreement with a tourist operator beginning in april this agreement was primarily for the purpose of allowing ati to build months of passenger operating experience on the boeing aircraft  which is required in order to transport passengers for the us military on such aircraft

revenues from dhl  bax schenker and other customers included the reimbursement of certain expenses 
excluding these reimbursable revenues  dhl  bax schenker and the us military accounted for  and  respectively  of acmi services revenues during excluding reimbursable revenues  dhl  bax schenker and the us military accounted for  and of acmi services revenues for future earnings from acmi services will be impacted by the timing of aircraft modifications and aircraft utilization levels which is affected by customer demand and our ability to maintain the aircraft at reliability levels expected by our customers 
customer demand for our services will depend on the cost competitiveness of the airlines and market preferences for the type of aircraft that we operate 
in june of  our award to fly three dc combi aircraft for the us military will expire 
the us military has expressed its preference to replace the dc combi aircraft that it utilizes with a more modern aircraft type  such as the boeing we expect the us military to begin a solicitation process for a contract to replace the dc combi aircraft 
we plan to bid on such a contract using our boeing combi aircraft  which will be ready for service in the second half of new customer agreements typically involve start up expenses  including those for route authorities  overfly rights  travel and other activities  and may impact future operating results 
revenue generating service may begin sometime later  however  depending on satisfaction of a number of conditions  including international regulations and laws  contract negotiations  flight crew availability  and arranging resources for aircraft handling 
the company s earnings may fluctuate due to the costs of aircraft repairs and maintenance and the timing of scheduled heavy maintenance which  under abx s policy are expensed as maintenance is performed 
during  pension expense for continuing operations will increase by approximately million due primarily to the effects of lower discount rates used to actuarially calculate the company s annual pension expense for as noted above  during acmi services included the operation of boeing and dc aircraft in bax schenker s north american network which was phased out in the company has begun to market these aircraft  engines and related parts to other airlines and parts dealers

the company s aircraft maintenance and repair business  airborne maintenance and engineering services  inc 
table of contents ames  has limited hangar facilities and significant fixed costs 
as a result  the company s operating results in future quarters may be impacted by the amount and timing of the completion of aircraft maintenance and engineering projects for ames s customers 
the company s contracts with the usps generated million of revenue during while these contracts expire in  we expect to renew them under similar terms 
discontinued operations pre tax losses from former hub services operations were million for compared to million for during  the results of discontinued operations primarily contain pension for former employees that supported sort operations under a hub services agreement with dhl and expenses for certain legal matters associated with those former sorting operations

the company incurs a fee under the pbh agreements for each flight hour operated 
the company has also arranged for cam s external leasing customers to participate under its pbh arrangements 
engine maintenance expense increased due to the increase in hours flown by aircraft operated by the company and an increase in hours flown by aircraft leased by cam to external customers 
during and  the company expensed scheduled airframe heavy maintenance events 
we experienced an increase in costs for parts during due to declining supply of used boeing parts 
during  we expect that aircraft maintenance expenses will increase due to an increase in the cost of parts for boeing aircraft and rate increases under certain maintenance agreements 
landing and ramp expense  which includes the cost of deicing chemicals  decreased by million during compared to the decrease during reflects reduced flying for bax schenker and a milder winter in north america compared to travel expense increased by million during compared to the increase is a result of additional flying operations  particularly in the european and asia pacific regions 

table of contents rent expense increased by million during compared to the increase primarily reflects five additional boeing freighter aircraft that we have added to the company s fleet since the fourth quarter of and an increase in the rental rates for the company s facilities in wilmington  ohio in conjunction with a new lease agreement executed with a regional port authority in may four of the five aircraft leased by the company are owned by dhl and operated by abx under the cmi agreement

other operating expenses include professional fees  navigational services  employee training  utilities  and the cost of parts sold to customers 
other operating expenses increased by million during compared to  primarily due to additional aircraft operations during interest expense decreased by million during compared to the decline in interest expense reflects the reduction in the level of the company s debt during the first four months of  lower interest rates and an increase in capitalized interest for the aircraft undergoing freighter modification 
interest rates on the company s variable interest  unsubordinated term loan decreased from an average of approximately in to approximately in we expect interest expense to increase during due to a higher level of debt which is being used to expand the company s aircraft fleet 
during  the company recorded a pre tax net loss on derivatives of million  reflecting the impact of lower market interest rates at december  on the interest rate swaps held by the company 
during   in conjunction with the new credit facility  the company terminated its hedge accounting of interest rate swaps related to the former term loan  which resulted in the recognition of million of losses which had previously been reflected in other comprehensive income 
additionally  the new credit facility requires the company to maintain interest rate derivative instruments for at least of the outstanding balance of the new subordinated term loan 
as a result  the company entered into a new interest rate swap in july of the company did not designate the recent interest rate swap as a hedge for accounting purposes 
accordingly  the effect of lower interest rates since the purchase of the interest rate swap resulted in a net unrealized loss for future fluctuations in interest rates will result in the recording of gains and losses on interest rate derivatives that the company holds

the increase in maintenance expenses for also included additional c check expense for aircraft operated by abx  whose policy is to expense c checks as incurred 
additionally  aircraft maintenance expense increased due to a campaign by ccia to improve the on time reliability level of their boeing and boeing aircraft 
the increase in maintenance expenses also reflects the increased cost to support the growth in block hours flown since and the higher maintenance cost for boeing aircraft operating in the bax schenker network 
ccia s boeing aircraft scheduled in the bax schenker network were assigned to operate on a greater number of multi stop routes compared to  which negatively impacted reliability and increased the cost of operating those aircraft 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million during  compared to depreciation expense increased due to the deployment of six modified aircraft since the end of landing and ramp expense  which included the cost of deicing chemicals  decreased million in  compared to the decrease was a result of dhl s removal of aircraft from service in conjunction with its us restructuring plan during the first quarter of travel expense increased million during compared to the increase was a result of additional crew training and increased international flying  particularly in the europe and asia pacific regions 
rent expense increased million during compared to the increase reflected a change in the allocation of expense for the wilmington  ohio facility due to the closure of the freight sorting operations there in july  and an increase in the rental rates for the wilmington facility in conjunction with a new lease agreement executed with a regional port authority in may insurance decreased million during compared to the decline in insurance expense primarily reflected the transition to a company insured employee medical coverage plan from a third party insurance plan for certain employee groups

table of contents in august  the company entered into an agreement with m b conversions limited and israel aerospace industries ltd  iai  for the conversion by iai of up to ten boeing series passenger aircraft to a standard freighter configuration during the year term of the agreement 
as of december   two such aircraft have completed the modification process and three boeing aircraft were undergoing modification to a standard freighter configuration 
if the company were to cancel the conversion program as of december   it would owe iai approximately million associated with additional conversion part kits which have been ordered 
in february  the company purchased two more boeing passenger aircraft with the intent to modify these aircraft into standard freighters 
in october  the company entered into an agreement with precision conversions  llc precision for the design  engineering and certification of a boeing combi aircraft variant 
the boeing combi variant to be developed by precision will incorporate full cargo pallet positions along with seating for up to passengers 
during  the company purchased two boeing passenger aircraft for combi conversion with precision and another boeing passenger aircraft for the standard freighter modification process with precision 
as of december   one boeing has completed the modification process for standard freighter configuration while the other two boeing are in the combi conversion process 
if the company were to cancel the conversion program as of december   it would owe precision approximately million associated with engineering efforts and conversion part kits which have been ordered 
outlook the table below summarizes the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments in thousands as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt  including interest payments operating leases aircraft modification obligations total contractual cash obligations the long term debt bears interest at to per annum 
the company provides defined benefit pension plans to certain employee groups 
the table above does not include cash contributions for pension funding due to the absence of scheduled maturities 
the timing of pension and post retirement healthcare payments cannot be reasonably determined  except for million expected to be paid in we estimate that total capital expenditures for could total million to million primarily for aircraft acquisitions and related modification costs involving boeing and boeing aircraft 
actual capital spending for any future period will be impacted by the progress in the aircraft modification process 
we expect to finance the aircraft purchases and modifications from current cash balances  future operating cash flow and the credit facility 
liquidity on may   the company executed a new credit facility with a consortium of banks credit facility to refinance a term loan of million 
the new credit facility includes a fully drawn term loan of million and a million revolving credit facility  of which the company has drawn million  net of repayments 
the credit facility has an additional accordion feature of million which the company may draw subject to the lenders consent 
if the company exercises the accordion feature  the same terms and conditions of the credit facility would apply  additional collateral would need to be posted to maintain the collateral coverage requirement and the additional debt may result in higher interest rates 
under the credit facility  interest rates are adjusted quarterly based on the prevailing libor or prime rates and a ratio of the company s outstanding debt level to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses ebitda 
at the company s current debt to ebitda ratio  the unsubordinated term loan and revolving loan bear a variable interest rate of and  respectively 
repayments of the term loan are scheduled to begin in june and the company expects to make further draws on the revolving 
table of contents loan to fund its fleet expansion plans 
in conjunction with the execution of the new credit facility  the company terminated its previous credit agreement 
the credit facility is collateralized by certain of the company s boeing and aircraft that are not collateralized under aircraft loans 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company is required to maintain collateral coverage equal to of the outstanding balance of the term loan and the total revolving credit facility 
under the credit facility  the company is subject to covenants and warranties that are usual and customary 
the credit facility contains covenants including  among other things  limitations on certain additional indebtedness  guarantees of indebtedness  as well as a total debt to ebitda ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the credit facility stipulates events of default including unspecified events that may have a material adverse effect on the company 
if an event of default occurs  the company may be forced to repay  renegotiate or replace the credit facility 
at december   the company had approximately million of cash balances and million available under the revolving credit facility  net of outstanding letters of credit which totaled million 
the company also expects to have available the million accordion feature noted above 
as specified under terms of abx s cmi agreement with dhl  the million balance at december  of the unsecured note payable to dhl will be extinguished ratably without payment through march  we believe that the company s current cash balances and forecasted cash flows provided from its operating agreements  combined with its credit facility  will be sufficient to fund operations  scheduled debt payments  required pension funding and planned capital expenditures for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december  and  we were not involved in any material unconsolidated spe transactions 
certain of our operating leases and agreements contain indemnification obligations to the lessor or one or more other parties that are considered usual and customary eg use  tax and environmental indemnifications  the terms of which range in duration and are often limited 
such indemnification obligations may continue after the expiration of the respective lease or agreement 
no amounts have been recognized in our financial statements for the underlying fair value of guarantees and indemnifications 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as certain disclosures included elsewhere in this report  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to select appropriate accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingencies 
in certain cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques which could be selected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our selection of policies and the estimation techniques we use  including those related to revenue recognition  post retirement liabilities  bad debts  self insurance reserves  valuation of spare parts inventory  useful lives  salvage values and impairment of property and equipment  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as for identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following significant and critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues generated from airline service agreements are typically recognized based on hours flown or the amount of aircraft and crew resources provided during a reporting period 
certain agreements include provisions for incentive 
table of contents payments based upon on time reliability 
these incentives are typically measured on a monthly basis and recorded to revenue in the corresponding month earned 
revenues for operating expenses that are reimbursed through customer agreements  including consumption of aircraft fuel  are generally recognized as the costs are incurred 
revenues from charter service agreements are recognized on scheduled and non scheduled flights when the specific flight has been completed 
revenues from the sale of aircraft parts are recognized when the parts are delivered 
revenues earned and expenses incurred in providing aircraft related maintenance  repair or technical services are recognized in the period in which the services are completed and delivered to the customer 
revenues derived from transporting freight and sorting parcels are recognized upon delivery of shipments and completion of services 
aircraft lease revenues are recognized as operating lease revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease agreements 
the company s revenues for the first quarter of included reimbursement for expenses incurred under the former dhl acmi agreement  the incremental mark up revenues set by amendments to the dhl acmi agreement  and reimbursement for employee severance  retention  vacation and other benefit costs incurred during the period 
revenues from the former dhl acmi agreement were generally determined based on expenses incurred during a period plus mark ups and were recognized when the related services were performed 
abx and dhl amended the dhl acmi agreement to set mark ups to specific quarterly amounts for the first quarter of in  abx and dhl executed the s r agreement which specified employee severance  retention and other benefits that dhl reimbursed to abx for payments made to its employees that were affected in conjunction with dhl s us restructuring plan 
dhl was obligated to reimburse abx for the cost of employee severance  retention  productivity bonuses and vacation benefits paid in accordance with the agreement 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  we assess in the fourth quarter of each year whether the company s goodwill acquired in acquisitions is impaired 
additional assessments may be performed on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are assessed for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators occur 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful economic lives and are periodically reviewed for impairment 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment  including the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill 
the company has two reporting units  ati and cam  that have goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of ati and cam separately using a market approach and an income approach utilizing discounted cash flows applied to a market derived rate of return 
the market approach utilizes market multiples from comparable publicly traded companies 
the market multiples include revenues  ebit earnings before interest and taxes  ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and ebitdar earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent 
we derive cash flow assumptions from many factors including recent market trends  expected revenues  cost structure  aircraft maintenance schedules and long term strategic plans for the deployment of aircraft 
key assumptions under the discounted cash flow models include projections for the number of aircraft in service  capital expenditures  long term growth rates  operating cash flows and market derived discount rates 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its respective carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its fair value  no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step is performed 
in the second step  fair values are assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment loss is recorded for the difference and charged to operations 
we have used the assistance of an independent business valuation firm in estimating an expected market rate of return  and in the development of a market approach for ati and cam using multiples of ebitdar  ebitda  ebit and revenues from comparable publicly traded companies 
based on our analysis  as of december   cam s fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than and ati s fair value exceeded its carrying value by 
the company s key assumptions used for goodwill testing include uncertainties 
those uncertainties include the level of demand for cargo aircraft by shippers  the us military and freight forwarders and cam s ability to lease aircraft near expected modification completion dates 
we anticipate that cam will successfully modify six boeing 
table of contents aircraft and one boeing aircraft into freighter configured aircraft over the next year and place them under long term lease agreements 
we anticipate that cam will successfully modify two boeing aircraft into combi configuration and that ati will deploy them 
we expect that ati will add two more boeing aircraft into service during we expect that ati will continue to operate combi aircraft for the us military 
the demand for customer airlift is projected based on input from customers  the volume of bids requested by the us military  management s interface with customer planning personnel and aircraft utilization trends 
certain events or changes in circumstances could negatively impact our key assumptions 
customer preferences for cargo aircraft may be impacted by changes in aviation fuel prices 
key customers  including the us military  may decide that they do not need as many aircraft as projected  or they may find alternative airlift 
the company s finite lived intangible asset is for customer relationships acquired with ati 
this asset is amortized over the estimated useful economic life and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the fair value of the asset was derived using projected revenues from existing customers and related attrition rates using the guidance under fasb asc topic property  plant and equipment  and separately from a discounted cash flow model used for goodwill impairment 
the projected net cash flows attributed to existing customers were discounted using an estimated cost of capital  based on market participant assumptions 
long lived assets aircraft and other long lived assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors which may cause an impairment include termination of aircraft from a customer s network  extended operating cash flow losses from the assets and management s decisions regarding the future use of assets 
to conduct impairment testing  the company groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash are largely independent of cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
for assets that are to be held and used  impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset group is less than the carrying value 
if impairment exists  an adjustment is made to write the assets down to fair value  and a loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying value and fair value 
fair values are determined considering quoted market values  discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals  as applicable 
depreciation depreciation of property and equipment is provided on a straight line basis over the lesser of an asset s useful life or lease term 
we periodically evaluate the estimated service lives and residual values used to depreciate our property and equipment 
the acceleration of depreciation expense or the recording of significant impairment losses could result from changes in the estimated useful lives of our assets 
we may change the estimated useful lives due to a number of reasons  such as the existence of excess capacity in our air system or ground networks  or changes in regulations grounding or limiting the use of aircraft 
self insurance we self insure certain claims related to workers compensation  aircraft  automobile  general liability and employee healthcare 
we record a liability for reported claims and an estimate for incurred claims that have not yet been reported 
accruals for these claims are estimated utilizing historical paid claims data  recent claims trends and  in the case of employee healthcare and workers compensation  an independent actuarial evaluation 
changes in claim severity and frequency could result in actual claims being materially different than the costs provided for in our results of operations 
we maintain excess claim coverage with common insurance carriers to mitigate our exposure to large claim losses 
contingencies we are involved in legal matters that have a degree of uncertainty associated with them 
we continually assess the likely outcomes of these matters and the adequacy of amounts  if any  provided for these matters 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not differ materially from our assessment of them 
there also can be no assurance that we know all matters that may be brought against us at any point in time 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of fasb asc topic income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of expected future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position or its results of operations 
the company has significant deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards nol cfs for federal income tax purposes which begin to expire in based upon projections of taxable income  we determined that it was more likely than not that the nol cf s will be realized prior to their expiration 
accordingly  we do not have an allowance against these deferred tax assets at this time 
we recognize the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
post retirement obligations the company sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans for abx s flight crewmembers and other eligible employees 
the company also sponsors non qualified  unfunded excess plans that provide benefits to executive management and crewmembers that are in addition to amounts permitted to be paid through our qualified plans under provisions of the tax laws 
in  we amended each defined benefit plan to freeze the accrual of additional benefits and we provided notification to the affected employees 
the company also sponsors unfunded post retirement healthcare plans for abx s flight crewmembers and non flight crewmember employees 
the accounting and valuation for these post retirement obligations are determined by prescribed accounting and actuarial methods that consider a number of assumptions and estimates 
the selection of appropriate assumptions and estimates is significant due to the long time period over which benefits will be accrued and paid 
the long term nature of these benefit payouts increases the sensitivity of certain estimates on our post retirement costs 
in actuarially valuing our pension obligations and determining related expense amounts  assumptions we consider most sensitive are discount rates and expected long term investment returns on plan assets 
other assumptions concerning retirement ages  mortality and employee turnover also affect the valuations 
for our post retirement healthcare plans  consideration of future medical cost trend rates is an important assumption in valuing these obligations 
actual results and future changes in these assumptions could result in future costs that are materially different than those recorded in our annual results of operations 
our actuarial valuation includes an assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets of 
our assumed rate of return is based on a targeted long term investment allocation of equity securities  fixed income securities and real estate 
the actual asset allocation at december  was equities  fixed income  real estate and cash 
the pension trust includes million of investments of the plans assets whose fair values have been estimated in the absence of readily determinable fair values 
such investments include private equity  hedge fund investments and real estate funds 
management s estimates are based on information provided by the fund managers or general partners of those funds 
in evaluating our assumptions regarding expected long term investment returns on plan assets  we consider a number of factors  including our historical plan returns in connection with our asset allocation policies  assistance from investment consultants hired to provide oversight over our actively managed investment portfolio and long term inflation assumptions 
the selection of the expected return rate materially affects our pension costs 
our expected long term rate of return remained at after analyzing expected returns on investment vehicles and considering our long term asset allocation expectations 
if we were to lower our long term rate of return assumption by a hypothetical basis points  expense in would be increased by approximately million 
we use a market value of assets as of the measurement date for determining pension expense 
in selecting the interest rate to discount estimated future benefit payments that have been earned to date to their net present value defined as the projected benefit obligation  we match the plan s benefit payment streams to high quality bonds of similar maturities 
the selection of the discount rate not only affects the reported funded status information as of december as shown in note h to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  but also affects the succeeding year s pension and post retirement healthcare costs 
the discount rates selected for december  
table of contents  based on the method described above  were to 
if we were to lower our discount rates by a hypothetical basis points  pension expense in would be increased by approximately million 
the assumed future increase in salaries and wages is no longer a significant estimate in determining pension costs because each defined benefit pension plan was frozen during with respect to additional benefit accruals 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of the aforementioned assumptions on our pension expense  pension obligation and accumulated other comprehensive income in thousands effect of change december  change in assumption pension expense pension obligation accumulated other comprehensive income pre tax basis point decrease in rate of return basis point decrease in discount rate aggregate effect of all the above changes discontinued operations in accordance with the guidance of fasb asc topic presentation of financial statements  a business component whose operations are discontinued is reported as discontinued operations if the cash flows of the component have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the company and the company will no longer have any significant continuing involvement in the business component 
the results of discontinued operations are aggregated and presented separately in the consolidated statement of operations 
fasb asc topic requires the reclassification of amounts presented for prior years to reflect their classification as discontinued operations 
exit activities we account for the costs associated with exit activities in accordance with fasb asc topic exit or disposal cost obligations 
one time  involuntary employee termination benefits are generally expensed when the company communicates the benefit arrangement to the employee that it will no longer require the services of the employee beyond a minimum retention period 
liabilities for contract termination costs associated with exit activities are recognized in the period incurred and measured initially at fair value 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 

asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requires comprehensive income to be presented in a single continuous statement of income and comprehensive income or separately in a consecutive financial statement to accompany the statement of income 
in addition  items of other comprehensive income that are reclassified to profit or loss are required to be presented separately on the face of the financial statements 
this guidance is intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements 
asu defers the changes in asu that pertain to how  when and where reclassification adjustments are presented 
both asu s are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december  the company s adoption of these standards is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this standard is effective for annual goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
this standard provides for an optional qualitative assessment for the annual testing of goodwill impairment that may allow companies to conclude that performing a detailed calculation of the fair value of a reporting unit is unnecessary 
this standard expands upon the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider between annual impairment tests in determining whether it is more likely 
table of contents than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
additionally this standard improves the examples of events and circumstances that an entity having a reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount should consider in determining whether to measure an impairment loss  if any  under the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  asu 
asu enhances disclosures regarding financial instruments and derivative instruments 
entities are required to provide both net information and gross information for these assets and liabilities 
this new guidance is to be applied retrospectively beginning in the company anticipates that the adoption of this standard will expand its consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates and changes in the price of jet fuel 
the risk associated with jet fuel  however  is largely mitigated by reimbursement through the agreements with our customers 
on may   the company executed a new credit facility with a consortium of banks credit facility 
the new credit facility includes a term loan of million 
under the credit facility  interest rates will be adjusted quarterly based on the company s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses ebitda  its outstanding debt level and prevailing libor or prime rates see note f to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s new credit facility requires the company to maintain derivative instruments for fluctuating interest rates  for at least fifty percent of the outstanding balance of the new unsubordinated term loan 
accordingly  in july  the company entered into a new interest rate swap instrument 
additionally  the company continues to hold certain interest rate swaps that were required for the former term loan 
as a result  future fluctuations in libor interest rates will result in the recording of unrealized gains and losses on interest rate derivatives held by the company 
the notional values were million as of december  see note j in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our accounting treatment for these hedging transactions 
as of december   the company has million of fixed interest rate debt and million of variable interest rate debt outstanding 
variable interest rate debt exposes us to differences in future cash flows resulting from changes in market interest rates 
variable interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the change in annual cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a change in interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  the debt issued at fixed interest rates is exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
fixed interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the increase in fair value of our long term debt through a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
as of december   a increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt by approximately million 
the company is exposed to concentration of credit risk primarily through cash deposits  cash equivalents  marketable securities and derivatives 
as part of our risk management process  we monitor and evaluate the credit standing of the financial institutions with which we do business 
the financial institutions with which we do business are generally highly rated 
the company is exposed to counterparty risk  which is the loss we could incur if a counterparty to a derivative contract defaulted 
at december   abx s defined benefit pension plans had total investment assets of million under investment management 
see note h in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these assets
