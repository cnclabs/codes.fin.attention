item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and item a controls and procedures 
a material weakness is a deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting  such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
as a result of this material weakness  management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting as of december  was not effective 
furthermore  as a result of the material weakness described above  management also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december  
table of contents this material weakness  or difficulties encountered in implementing new or improved controls or other remedial steps  could prevent us from accurately monitoring and overseeing compliance with our financial covenants 
the failure to maintain compliance with our financial covenants could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
see risk factors risks related to our business and properties covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
furthermore  the material weakness  or difficulties encountered in implementing new or improved controls or other remedial steps  could prevent us from accurately reporting our results of operations  result in material misstatements in our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
this could prevent or inhibit our ability to access third party sources of capital and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  thereby adversely affecting the perception of our business and the market price of our securities 
we cannot be certain that any remedial measures we have begun taking or intend to take will adequately remediate the weakness and will ensure that we maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future and  accordingly  additional material weaknesses may occur in the future 
covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
our unsecured revolving credit facility  unsecured term loan  secured term loan and senior notes contain certain and varying restrictions on the amount of debt we are allowed to incur and other restrictions and requirements on our operations including  among other things  requirements to maintain specified coverage ratios and other financial covenants  and limitations on our ability to make distributions  enter into joint ventures  develop properties and engage in certain business combination transactions 
these restrictions  particularly if we are at or near the required ratios or thresholds  could prevent or inhibit our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pursue some business initiatives or effect certain transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our company  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
although we were in compliance with all of the financial and operating covenants of our outstanding debt agreements as of december   we were near the required ratios or thresholds for certain of the covenants  including the consolidated debt yield and distribution payout ratio under the senior notes  the unencumbered pool leverage ratio of the revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan  and the maximum consolidated total indebtedness under the revolving credit facility  unsecured term loan  secured term loan and senior notes 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the consolidated debt yield covenant under our senior notes is currently being impacted by three significant factors vacancy in certain of our operating properties and related tenant improvement costs incurred in connection with the lease up those properties  the impact of acquisition costs and our overall leverage levels 
the impact of acquisition costs is unique to the calculation of the consolidated debt yield covenant in our senior notes 
therefore  as a result of the stress on the consolidated debt yield covenant  we may be limited in our ability to pursue additional developments  redevelopments or acquisitions that may not be initially accretive to our results of operations but would otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders 
our dividend payout ratio covenant under the senior notes also is currently impacted by  among other things  impairment charges  which reduce ffo solely for purposes of this covenant calculation 
as such  we may be required to limit or restrict our ability to sell underperforming properties in our portfolio  which may otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders  and or curtail our distributions to common shareholders if we otherwise determine that our dividend payout ratio would be adversely impacted 
in addition  as a result of the stress on these covenants  our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility or incur other additional debt may be limited  and we may be forced to raise additional equity to repay the senior notes or other debt 
moreover  our continued ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility is subject to compliance with financial and operating covenants and our failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under the credit facility 
as noted above  we were near the required ratios or thresholds for certain of the financial covenants in our debt agreements as of december   and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with these covenants in future periods 
in addition  we had a disagreement with the holders of our senior notes regarding the appropriate calculation of the consolidated debt yield and the dividend payout ratio covenants under the senior notes 
although we are in compliance with these covenants under the noteholders interpretation  we can provide no assurance that the noteholders will not seek to declare an event of default and accelerate maturity of the senior notes 
our debt agreements also contain cross default provisions that would be triggered if we are in default under other loans in in excess of certain amounts 
for example  an event of default under our senior notes would create an event of default under our other senior debt instruments 
in the event of a default  the lenders could accelerate the timing of payments under the debt obligations and we may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources  which may not be available to us on attractive terms  or at all  which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition  results of operations and ability to make distributions to our shareholders 

table of contents we may not be able to access adequate cash to fund our business or growth strategy  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
our business requires access to adequate cash to finance our operations  distributions  capital expenditures  debt service obligations  development and redevelopment costs and property acquisition costs  if any  and to refinance or repay maturing debt 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to fund our business  particularly if we are unable to renew leases  lease vacant space or re lease space as leases expire according to expectations 
this risk may be even more pronounced given the ongoing challenging economic environment 
moreover  we rely on third party sources to fund our capital needs 
we may not be able to obtain the financing on favorable terms  in the time period we desire  or at all 
our access to third party sources of capital depends  in part  on general market conditions  the market s view of the quality of our assets  the market s perception of our growth potential  our current debt levels  our current and expected future earnings  our cash flow and cash distributions  and the market price per share of our common stock 
if we cannot obtain capital from third party sources  we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist  satisfy our principal and interest obligations or make the distributions to our shareholders 
in addition  our access to funds under our revolving credit facility depends on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facility to meet their funding commitment to us 
we cannot assure you that continuing long term disruptions in the global economy and the continuation of tighter credit conditions among  and potential failures of  third party financial institutions as a result of such disruptions  will not have an adverse effect on our lenders 
if our lenders are not able to meet their funding commitment to us  our business  results of operation  cash flow and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our debt level may have a negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition  cash flow and our ability to pursue growth through acquisitions and development projects 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding indebtednesses  consisting principally of our mortgage debt  senior unsecured notes  term loans and amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
in connection with our acquisition and development activity  we significantly increased our debt in and we will incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with  among other things  our acquisition  development and operating activities 
our use of debt financing creates risks  including risks that our cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest  we will be unable to refinance some or all of our indebtedness or that any refinancing will not be on terms as favorable as those of the existing indebtedness  required debt payments will not be reduced if the economic performance of any property declines  debt service obligations will reduce funds available for distribution to our security holders and funds available for acquisitions  development and redevelopment  most of our secured debt obligations require the lender to be made whole to the extent we decide to pay off the debt prior to the maturity date  and any default on our indebtedness  including as a result of a failure to maintain certain financial and operating covenants in our credit facility  unsecured term loan and senior notes  could result in acceleration of those obligations and possible loss of property to foreclosure 
if the economic performance of any of our properties declines  our ability to make debt service payments would be adversely affected 
if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  we may lose that property to lender foreclosure with a resulting loss of income and asset value 

table of contents our leverage levels may make it difficult to obtain additional financing based on our current portfolio or to refinance existing debt on favorable terms or at all 
failure to obtain additional financing could impede our ability to grow and develop our business through  among other things  acquisitions and developments  and a failure to refinance our existing debt as it matures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity and ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
our leverage levels also could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally and may adversely affect the market price of our securities if an investment in our company is perceived to be more risky than an investment in our peers 
if recent adverse global market and economic conditions worsen or do not fully recover  our business  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
overall financial market and economic conditions have been challenging in recent years  beginning with the credit crisis and recession that began in challenging economic conditions persisted throughout  including a worsening european sovereign debt crisis and volatility in the debt and equity markets  and have continued to some degree into these conditions  which could continue or worsen  combined with the ongoing difficult financial conditions still being faced by numerous financial institutions  high unemployment and residential and commercial real estate markets that have been slow to recover  among other things  have contributed to ongoing market volatility and uncertain expectations for the us and other economies 
as a result of these conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected in the markets in which we own properties and we and our tenants conduct operations 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of numerous financial institutions specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease  to provide funding to borrowers  which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants and our lenders 
if these conditions do not fully recover  they may limit our ability  and the ability of our tenants  to replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis  access the capital markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements and may result in material adverse effects on our and our tenants financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  if our tenants businesses or ability to obtain financing deteriorates further  they may be unable to pay rent to us  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow 
we cannot predict the duration or severity of the current economic challenges  and if these conditions worsen or do not fully recover  our business  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
acquired properties may expose us to unknown liabilities 
we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse  or with only limited recourse  against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities 
as a result  if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties  we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it  which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include liabilities for clean up of undisclosed or undiscovered environmental contamination  claims by tenants  vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business  and claims for indemnification by general partners  directors  officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 
we compete with other parties for tenants and property acquisitions 
our business strategy contemplates expansion through acquisitions 
the commercial real estate industry is highly competitive  and we compete with substantially larger companies  including substantially larger reits and institutional investment funds  for the acquisition  development and leasing of properties 
as a result  we may not be able or have the opportunity to make suitable investments on favorable terms in the future  which may impede our growth and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  competition for acquisitions may significantly increase the purchase price and or require us to  among other things  make concessions to sellers and or agree to higher non refundable deposits  which could require us to agree to acquisition terms less favorable to us 
we also face significant competition for tenants in our properties from owners and operators of business park and industrial and office properties that may be more willing to make space available to prospective tenants at lower prices and with greater tenant improvements and other concessions than comparable spaces in our properties  especially in difficult economic times 
thus  competition could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge and increase the tenant improvements and other concessions that we offer  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to the credit risk of our tenants  which may declare bankruptcy or otherwise fail to make lease payments  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 
we are subject to the credit risk of our tenants 
we cannot assure you that our tenants will not default on their leases and fail to make rental payments to us 
in particular  the recent global recession and disruptions in the financial and credit markets  local economic conditions and other factors affecting the industries in which our tenants operate may affect our tenants ability to obtain financing to operate their businesses or continue to profitability execute their business plans 
this  in turn  may cause our tenants to be unable to meet their financial obligations  including making rental payments to us  which may result in their bankruptcy or insolvency 
a tenant in bankruptcy may be able to restrict our ability to collect unpaid rent and interest during the bankruptcy proceeding and may reject the lease 
in the event of the tenant s breach of its obligations to us or its rejection of the lease in bankruptcy proceedings  we may be unable to locate a replacement tenant in a timely manner or on comparable or better terms 
the loss of rental revenues from any of our larger tenants  a number of our smaller tenants or any combination thereof  combined with our inability to replace such tenants on a timely basis may materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
a majority of our tenants hold leases covering less than  square feet 
many of these tenants are small companies with nominal net worth  and therefore may be challenged in operating their businesses during economic downturns 
in addition  certain of our properties are  and may be in the future be  substantially leased to a single tenant and  therefore  such property s operating performance and our ability to service the property s debt is particularly exposed to the economic condition of the tenant 
the loss of rental revenues from any of our larger tenants or a number of our smaller tenants may materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
loss of the us government as a tenant could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow  and could cause an impairment of the value of some of our properties 
the us government accounted for of our total annualized rental revenue as of december   and the us government combined with government contractors accounted for over of our total annualized base rent as of december  a significant reduction in federal government spending could affect the ability of these tenants to fulfill lease obligations or decrease the likelihood that they will renew their leases with us 
further  economic conditions in the greater washington  dc region  particularly the washington  dc metropolitan area  are significantly dependent upon the level of federal government spending in the region  and uncertainty regarding the potential for future reduction in government spending could also decrease or delay leasing activity from the us government and government contractors 
moreover  the budget control act passed in  which imposed caps on the federal budget in order to achieve targeted spending levels over the fiscal years  has fueled further uncertainty regarding future government spending reductions 
in the event of a significant reduction in federal government spending  there could be negative economic changes in our region which could adversely impact the ability of our tenants to perform their financial obligations under our leases or the likelihood of their lease renewal 
in addition  some of our leases with the us government are for relatively short terms or provide for early termination rights  including termination for convenience or in the event of a budget shortfall 
further  on july   the united states department of defense issued the unified facilities criteria the ufc  which establish minimum antiterrorism standards for the design and construction of new and existing buildings leased by the departments and agencies of the department of defense 
the loss of the federal government as a tenant resulting from reductions in federal government spending  exercise of the government s contractual termination rights  our inability to comply with the ufc standards or for any other reason would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could cause the value of our affected properties to be impaired 
a reduction or elimination of rent from the us government or other significant tenants would also materially reduce our cash flow and adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our security holders 
we may be unable to renew expiring leases or re lease vacant space on a timely basis or on attractive terms  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 
approximately  and of our annualized base rent is scheduled to expire in  and  respectively  excluding month to month leases 
current tenants may not renew their leases upon the expiration of their terms 
alternatively  current tenants may attempt to terminate their leases prior to the expiration of their current terms 
for example  as discussed in the risk factor above  our leases with the us government include favorable tenant termination provisions 
if non renewals or terminations occur  we may not be able to locate qualified replacement tenants and  as a result  we could lose a significant source of revenue while remaining responsible for the payment of our financial obligations 
moreover  the terms of a renewal or new lease  including the amount of rent  may be less favorable to us than the current lease terms  or we may be forced to provide tenant improvements at our expense or provide other concessions or additional services to maintain or attract tenants 
any of these factors could cause a decline in lease revenue or an increase in operating expenses  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 

table of contents our variable rate debt subjects us to interest rate risk 
we have an unsecured revolving credit facility  a million unsecured term loan  which was expanded to million in february  and a million secured term loan  of which million was paid in january  and certain other debt  some of which is unhedged  that bears interest at a variable rate  and we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt  of which  million was hedged through interest rate swap agreements 
increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense  if not hedged effectively or at all  which would adversely affect net earnings and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to our security holders 
for example  if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt outstanding as of december  increased by  or basis points  the increase in interest expense on our existing variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flow by approximately million annually 
we have and may continue to engage in hedging transactions  which can limit our gains and increase exposure to losses 
we have and may continue to enter into hedging transactions to attempt to protect us from the effects of interest rate fluctuations on floating rate debt  or in some cases  prior to a proposed debt issuance 
our hedging transactions may include interest rate swap agreements or interest rate cap or floor agreements  or other interest rate exchange contracts 
hedging activities may not have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
no hedging activity can completely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates 
moreover  interest rate hedging could fail to protect us and could adversely affect us because  among other things available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which we seek protection  the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability  the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay  the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction  and the value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value 
such downward adjustments  or mark to market losses  would reduce our equity 
hedging involves risk and typically involves costs  including transaction costs that may reduce our overall returns on our investments 
these costs increase as the period covered by the hedging increases and during periods of rising and volatile interest rates 
these costs will also limit the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders 
we generally intend to hedge as much of the interest rate risk as management determines is in our best interests given the cost of such hedging transactions 
reit qualification rules may limit our ability to enter into hedging transactions by  among other things  requiring us to limit our income from hedges 
if we are unable to hedge effectively because of the reit rules  we will face greater interest rate exposure 
all of our properties are located in the greater washington dc region  making us vulnerable to changes in economic  regulatory or other conditions in that region that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
all of our properties are located in the greater washington dc region  exposing us to greater risks than if we owned properties in multiple geographic regions 
economic conditions in the greater washington dc region may significantly affect the occupancy and rental rates of our properties 
a decline in occupancy and rental rates  in turn  may significantly affect our profitability and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations 
there can be no assurance that these markets will continue to grow or that favorable economic conditions will exist 
further  the economic condition of the region may also depend on one or more industries and  therefore  an economic downturn in one of these industry sectors may adversely affect our performance 
for example  the us government  which has a large presence in our markets  accounted for of our total annualized base rent as of december   and the us government combined with government contractors accounted for over of our total annualized base rent as of december  we are therefore directly affected by decreases in federal government spending either directly through the potential loss of a us government tenant or indirectly if the businesses of tenants that contract with the us government are negatively impacted 
in addition to economic conditions  we may also be subject to changes in the region s regulatory environment such as increases in real estate and other taxes  costs of complying with government regulations or increased regulation and other factors or other adverse conditions or events such as natural disasters 
thus  adverse developments and or conditions in the greater washington dc region could reduce demand for space  impact the credit worthiness of our tenants or force our tenants to curtail operations  which could impair their ability to meet their rent obligations to us and  accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents development and construction risks could materially adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects 
our renovation  redevelopment  development and related construction activities may subject us to the following risks we may be unable to obtain  or suffer delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects  we may incur construction costs for a property that exceeds our original estimates due to increased costs for materials or labor or other costs that we did not anticipate  we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms  if at all  especially with respect to large scale developments and redevelopments such as first street  nw  first street  ne  and th street  nw  which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities  and we may be unable to complete construction and lease up of a property on schedule  which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs 
additionally  the time frame required for development  construction and lease up of these properties means that we may have to wait years for a significant cash return 
because we are required to make cash distributions to our shareholders  if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient  we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions 
any of these conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects 
failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth and or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may make selected acquisitions outside our current geographic market from time to time as appropriate opportunities arise 
our historical experience is in the greater washington dc region  and we may not be able to operate successfully in other market areas where we have limited or no experience 
we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets 
these risks include  among others a lack of market knowledge and understanding of the local economies  an inability to identify promising acquisition or development opportunities  an inability to identify and cultivate relationships that  similar to our relationships in the greater washington dc region  are important to successfully effecting our business plan  an inability to employ construction trades people  and a lack of familiarity with local government and permitting procedures 
any of these factors could adversely affect the profitability of projects outside our current markets and limit the success of our acquisition and development strategy 
if our acquisition and development strategy is negatively affected  our growth may be impeded and our results of operations materially adversely affected 
in addition  during and we entered the downtown washington  dc market in connection with our acquisition of seven downtown washington  dc real estate assets  owned through direct or indirect interests 
see we have limited experience in owning  developing and operating large  multi tenant office properties  particularly in downtown washington  dc  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  above 
we have limited experience in engaging in lending activities  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in and  we structured separate investments in two washington  dc office properties in the form of loans to the owners of the property a million loan that bears interest at a rate of per annum  is interest only and matures on april   and a million loan that bears interest at a rate of per annum  is interest only and matures on may  each loan is secured by a portion of the owners interest in the respective property and is effectively subordinate to a senior mortgage loan on the property 
we may engage in additional lending activities in the future  including mezzanine financing activities 
these 
table of contents types of loans involve a higher degree of risk than long term senior mortgage lending secured by income producing real property  because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender 
in addition  mezzanine loans may have higher loan to value ratios than conventional mortgage loans  resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal 
if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan  or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy  our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt is paid in full 
where debt senior to our loan exists  the presence of intercreditor arrangements between the holder of the mortgage loan and us  as the mezzanine lender  may limit our ability to amend our loan documents  assign our loans  accept prepayments  exercise our remedies and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers 
as a result  we may not recover some or all of our investment  which could result in losses 
in addition  even if we are able to foreclose on the underlying collateral following a default on a mezzanine loan  we would be substituted for the defaulting borrower and  to the extent income generated on the underlying property is insufficient to meet outstanding debt obligations on the property  may need to commit substantial additional capital to stabilize the property and prevent additional defaults to lenders with existing liens on the property 
significant losses related to mezzanine loans could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
under some of our leases  tenants have the right to terminate prior to the scheduled expiration of the lease  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 
some of our leases for our current properties provide tenants with the right to terminate prior to the scheduled expiration of the lease 
if a tenant terminates its lease with us prior to the expiration of the term  we may be unable to re lease that space on as favorable terms  or at all  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our security holders 
property owned through joint ventures  or in limited liability companies and partnerships in which we are not the sole equity holder  may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interests 
we have  and may in the future  make investments through partnerships  limited liability companies or joint ventures  some of which may be significant in size 
in particular  during and  we entered a number of joint ventures in connection with our acquisition and development of various real estate assets 
partnership  limited liability company or joint venture investments may involve various risks  including the following our partners  co members or joint ventures might become bankrupt in which event we and any other remaining general partners or joint ventures would generally remain liable for the liabilities of the partnership or joint venture  our partners  co members or joint ventures might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals  our partners  co members or joint ventures may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions  requests  policies  or objectives  including our current policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust  and agreements governing joint ventures  limited liability companies and partnerships often contain restrictions on the transfer of a joint venture s  member s or partner s interest or buy sell or other provisions that may result in a purchase or sale of the interest at a disadvantageous time or on disadvantageous terms 
the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to make distributions with respect to  and the market price of  our securities 
illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
because real estate investments are relatively illiquid  our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to adverse changes in the performance of such properties may be limited 
the real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control  including adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions  changes in interest rates and in the availability  cost and terms of debt financing  
table of contents changes in governmental laws and regulations  fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and costs of compliance with laws and regulations  fiscal policies and ordinances  the ongoing need for capital improvements  particularly in older buildings  changes in operating expenses  and civil unrest  acts of war and natural disasters  including earthquakes and floods  which may result in uninsured and underinsured losses 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us  or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us 
we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 
moreover  the reit rules governing property sales and agreements that we may enter into with joint venture partners or contributors to our operating partnership not to sell certain properties for a period of time may interfere with our ability to dispose of properties on a timely basis without incurring significant additional costs 
we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold 
we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements 
in acquiring a property  we may agree to lock out provisions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions  such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property 
we may also acquire properties that are subject to a mortgage loan that may limit our ability to sell the properties prior to the loan s maturity 
these factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  cash flow as well as our ability to make distributions to our security holders 
liabilities under environmental laws for contamination may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
our operating expenses could be higher than anticipated due to liability created under  existing or future federal  state  or local environmental laws and regulations for contamination 
an owner or operator of real property can face strict  joint and several liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances  including petroleum based products at  on  under or from the property 
similarly  a former owner or operator of real property can face the same liability for the disposal of hazardous substances that occurred during the time of ownership or operation 
we may face liability regardless of our lack of knowledge of the contamination  the extent of the contamination  the timing of the release of the contamination  or whether or not we caused the contamination 
environmental liability for contamination may include the following  without limitation investigation and feasibility study costs  remediation costs  litigation costs  oversight costs  monitoring costs  institutional control costs  penalties from state and federal agencies  and third party claims 
moreover  operations on site may be required to be suspended until certain environmental contamination is remediated and or permits are received and environmental laws can impose permanent restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used depending on the extent and nature of the contamination 
this may result in a default of the terms of the lease entered into with our tenants 
environmental laws also may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination 
in addition  the presence of hazardous substances at  on  under or from a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property or borrow using the property as collateral  thus harming our financial condition 
there may be environmental liabilities associated with our properties of which we are unaware 
for example  some of our properties contain  or may have contained in the past  underground tanks for the storage of hazardous substances  petroleum based or waste products  or some of our properties have been used  or may have been used  historically to conduct industrial operations  and any of these circumstances could create a potential for release of hazardous substances 

table of contents non compliance with environmental laws at our properties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
our properties are subject to various federal  state  and local environmental laws 
non compliance with these environmental laws could subject us or our tenants to liability and changes in these laws could increase the potential costs of compliance or increase liability for noncompliance 
although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from a tenant s activities on the property  we could nonetheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest for environmental liabilities created by our tenants  and we cannot be sure that our tenants would satisfy their indemnification obligations under the applicable sales agreement or lease 
moreover  these environmental liabilities could affect our tenants ability to make rental payments to us 
non compliance with environmental laws at our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our security holders 
liabilities arising from the presence of hazardous building materials at our properties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
as the owner or operator of real property  we may also incur liability based on various building conditions 
for example  buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain  may contain  or may have contained  asbestos containing material  or acm 
environmental  health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners  operators or employers for non compliance with those requirements 
these requirements include special precautions  such as removal  abatement or air monitoring  if acm would be disturbed during maintenance  renovation or demolition of a building  potentially resulting in substantial costs 
in addition  we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment 
the company s properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues  which could lead to liability for adverse health effects  property damage  or remediation costs 
when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  mold growth may occur  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants 
indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation  chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources  and other biological contaminants such as pollen  viruses  and bacteria 
concern about indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants  including mold  has been increasing as exposure to these airborne contaminants have been alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms  including allergic or other reactions 
as a result  the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or to increase ventilation 
in addition  the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants  employees of our tenants  and others if property damage or health concerns arise 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire  safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that materially adversely impact our cash flow 
all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act  or the ada 
the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities  but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities 
compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and non compliance could result in the imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants  or both 
while the tenants to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions  and typically under our leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance  if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated  or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated  the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to security holders 
in addition  we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations  building codes and other land use regulations  as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties 
we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our security holders 

table of contents an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policies on our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
under the terms and conditions of most of the leases currently in force on our properties our tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons  air  water  land or property  on or off the premises  due to activities conducted on the properties  except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents 
additionally  tenants are generally required  at the tenant s expense  to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease  liability and full replacement value property damage insurance policies 
however  our largest tenant  the federal government  is not required to maintain property insurance at all 
we have obtained comprehensive liability  casualty  earthquake  flood and rental loss insurance policies on our properties 
all of these policies may  depending on the nature of the loss  involve substantial deductibles and certain exclusions 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our tenants will properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles 
should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above  or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy  we could lose all or part of our capital invested in  and anticipated revenue from  one or more of the properties  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our security holders 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect any market on which our securities trade  the markets in which we operate  our business and our results of operations 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our business and our results of operations 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact the value of our properties through damage  destruction  loss or increased security costs 
in particular  we may be directly exposed in washington  dc  a large metropolitan area that has been  or may be in the future  a target of actual or threatened terrorism attacks 
the terrorism insurance that we obtain may not be sufficient to cover loss for damages to our properties as a result of terrorist attacks 
in addition  certain losses resulting from these types of events are uninsurable and others would not be covered by our current terrorism insurance 
additional terrorism insurance may not be available at a reasonable price or at all 
if the properties in which we invest are unable to obtain sufficient and affordable insurance coverage  the value of those investments could decline  and in the event of an uninsured loss  we could lose all or a portion of an investment 
the united states may enter into armed conflicts in the future 
the consequences of any armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business 
any of these events could result in increased volatility in or damage to the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they also could result in a continuation of the current economic uncertainty in the united states or abroad 
adverse economic conditions could affect the ability of our tenants to pay rent  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to make distributions to our security holders  and may adversely affect and or result in volatility in the market price for our securities 
we face risks associated with our tenants being designated prohibited persons by the office of foreign assets control 
pursuant to executive order and other laws  the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury  or ofac  maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned  or prohibited persons 
ofac regulations and other laws prohibit conducting business or engaging in transactions with prohibited persons 
certain of our loan and other agreements may require us to comply with these ofac requirements 
if a tenant or other party with whom we contract is placed on the ofac list  we may be required by the ofac requirements to terminate the lease or other agreement 
any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or a damage claim by the other party that the termination was wrongful 
rising energy costs may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
electricity and natural gas  the most common sources of energy used by commercial buildings  are subject to significant price volatility 
in recent years  energy costs  including energy generated by natural gas and electricity  have fluctuated significantly 
some of our properties may be subject to leases that require our tenants to pay all utility costs while other leases may provide that tenants will reimburse us for utility costs in excess of a base year amount 
it is possible that some or all of our tenants will not fulfill their lease obligations and reimburse us for their share of any significant energy rate increases and that we will not be able to retain or replace our tenants if energy price fluctuations continue 
also  to the extent under a lease we agree to pay for such costs  rising energy prices will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents risks related to our organization and structure our executive officers have agreements that provide them with benefits in the event of a change in control of our company or if their employment agreement is terminated without cause or not renewed  which could prevent or deter a change in control of our company 
we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers  douglas j 
donatelli  nicholas r 
smith  barry h 
bass  james h 
dawson and joel f 
bonder  that provide them with severance benefits if their employment ends under certain circumstances following a change in control of our company  terminated without cause  or if the executive officer resigns for good reason as defined in the employment agreements 
these benefits could increase the cost to a potential acquirer of our company and thereby prevent or deter a change in control of the company that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the interests of our security holders 
we may experience conflicts of interest with several members of our board of trustees and our executive officers relating to their ownership of units of our operating partnership 
some of our trustees and executive officers may have conflicting duties because  in their capacities as our trustees and executive officers  they have a duty to our company  and in our capacity as general partner of our operating partnership  they have a fiduciary duty to the limited partners  and some executive officers are themselves limited partners and own a significant number of units of limited partner interest in our operating partnership 
these conflicts of interest could lead to decisions that are not in your best interest 
conflicts may arise when the interests of our shareholders and the limited partners of our operating partnership diverge  particularly in circumstances in which there may be an adverse tax consequence to the limited partners  such as upon the sale of assets or the repayment of indebtedness 
we depend on key personnel  particularly mr 
douglas j 
donatelli  with long standing business relationships  the loss of whom could threaten our ability to operate our business successfully and have other negative implications under certain of our indebtedness 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of our senior management team  including douglas j 
donatelli 
in particular  the extent and nature of the relationships that mr 
donatelli has developed in the real estate community in our markets is critically important to the success of our business 
although we have an employment agreement with mr 
donatelli and other named executive officers  there is no guarantee that mr 
donatelli or our other key executive officers will remain employed with us 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers 
the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team  particularly mr 
donatelli  would harm our business and prospects 
further  loss of a member of our senior management team could be negatively perceived in the capital markets  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 
further  the terms of certain of our debt instruments  including one of our term loans  includes a default provision whereby if any two of douglas donatelli  nicholas smith or barry bass  three of named executive officers  cease to maintain their current positions or duties at our company for any reason  a default under such debt could be triggered unless  within six months  our board has appointed a qualified substitute individual acceptable to the majority of the lenders in their sole discretion 
one of our trustees may have conflicts of interest with our company 
one of our company s trustees  terry l 
stevens  currently serves as senior vice president and chief financial officer of highwoods properties  inc  a fully integrated  north carolina based reit that owns  leases  manages  develops and constructs office and retail properties  some of which are located in our target markets 
as a result  conflicts may arise when we and highwoods properties  inc compete in the same markets for properties  tenants  personnel and other services 
our rights and the rights of our security holders to take action against our trustees and officers are limited  which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interests 
maryland law generally provides that a trustee has no liability for actions taken as a trustee  but may not be relieved of any liability to the company or its security holders for actions taken in bad faith  with willful misfeasance  gross negligence or reckless disregard for his or her duties 
our amended and restated declaration of trust authorizes us to indemnify  and to pay or reimburse reasonable expenses to  our trustees and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law 
in addition  our declaration of trust limits the liability of our trustees and officers for money damages  except as otherwise prohibited by maryland law or for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money  property or services  or a final judgment or other final adjudication based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the trustee or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated 

table of contents as a result  we and our security holders may have more limited rights against our trustees than might otherwise exist 
our amended and restated bylaws require us to indemnify each trustee or officer who has been successful  on the merits or otherwise  in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made a party by reason of his or her service to us 
in addition  we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our trustees and officers 
our series a preferred shares have  and future issuances of our preferred shares may have  terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
in january  we issued million of our series a cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred shares 
our series a preferred shares have certain conversion and redemption features that could be triggered upon a change of control  which may make it more difficult for or discourage a party from taking over our company 
in addition  our declaration of trust permits our board of trustees to issue up to million preferred shares  issuable in one or more classes or series 
our board of trustees may increase the number of preferred shares authorized by our declaration of trust without shareholder approval 
our board of trustees may also classify or reclassify any unissued preferred shares and establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote  to participate in earnings and to convert into securities of any such preferred shares  which rights may be superior to those of our common shares 
thus  in addition to our series a preferred shares  our board of trustees could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of the common shares might receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price of our common shares 
our ownership limitations may restrict business combination opportunities 
to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  no more than of the value of our outstanding shares of beneficial interest may be owned  directly or under applicable attribution rules  by five or fewer individuals as defined to include certain entities during the last half of each taxable year other than our first reit taxable year 
to preserve our reit qualification  our declaration of trust generally prohibits direct or indirect beneficial ownership as defined under the code by any person of i more than of the number or value of our outstanding common shares or ii more than of the value of our outstanding shares of all classes 
in addition  pursuant to the articles supplementary setting forth the terms of our series a preferred shares  no person may own  or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code  more than by value or number of shares  whichever is more restrictive of our series a preferred shares 
generally  shares owned by affiliated owners will be aggregated for purposes of the ownership limitation 
our declaration of trust has created a special higher ownership limitation of no more than for the group comprised of louis t 
donatelli  douglas j 
donatelli and certain related persons 
unless the applicable ownership limitation is waived by our board of trustees prior to transfer  any transfer of our common shares that would violate the ownership limitation will be null and void  and the intended transferee will acquire no rights in such shares 
common shares that would otherwise be held in violation of the ownership limit will be designated as shares in trust and transferred automatically to a trust effective on the day before the purported transfer or other event giving rise to such excess ownership 
the beneficiary of the trust will be one or more charitable organizations named by us 
the ownership limitation could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control or other transaction in which holders of common shares might receive a premium for their common shares over the then current market price or that such holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests 
the ownership limitation provisions also may make our common shares an unsuitable investment vehicle for any person seeking to obtain  either alone or with others as a group  ownership of i more than of the number or value of our outstanding common shares or ii more than in value of our outstanding shares of all classes 
our board of trustees may change our investment and operational policies and practices without a vote of our security holders  which limits your control of our policies and practices 
our major policies  including our policies and practices with respect to investments  financing  growth  debt capitalization  reit qualification and distributions  are determined by our board of trustees 
although we have no present intention to do so  our board of trustees may amend or revise these and other policies from time to time without a vote of our security holders 
accordingly  our security holders have limited control over changes in our policies 
our declaration of trust and bylaws do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we or our operating partnership may incur 
if we become highly leveraged  then the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and harm our financial condition 

table of contents our declaration of trust contains provisions that make removal of our trustees difficult  which could make it difficult for our shareholders to effect changes to our management 
our declaration of trust provides that a trustee may be removed  with or without cause  only upon the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding common shares 
vacancies may be filled by the board of trustees 
this requirement makes it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing trustees 
our bylaws may only be amended by our board of trustees  which could limit your control of certain aspects of our corporate governance 
our board of trustees has the sole authority to amend our bylaws 
thus  the board is able to amend the bylaws in a way that may be detrimental to your interests 
maryland law may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
maryland law provides broad discretion to our board of trustees with respect to their duties as trustees in considering a change in control of our company  including that our board is subject to no greater level of scrutiny in considering a change in control transaction than with respect to any other act by our board 
the maryland business combination act restricts mergers and other business combinations between our company and an interested shareholder for five years after the most recent date on which the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder  and thereafter imposes special shareholder voting requirements on these combinations 
an interested shareholder is defined as any person who is the beneficial owner of or more of the voting power of our common shares and also includes any of our affiliates or associates that  at any time within the two year period prior to the date of a proposed merger or other business combination  was the beneficial owner of or more of our voting power 
additionally  the control shares provisions of the maryland general corporation law  or mgcl  are applicable to us as if we were a corporation 
these provisions eliminate the voting rights of issued and outstanding shares acquired in quantities so as to constitute control shares  as defined under the mgcl  unless our shareholders approve such voting rights by the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter  excluding all interested shares and shares held by our trustees and officers 
control shares are generally defined as shares which  when aggregated with other shares controlled by the shareholder  entitle the shareholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing trustees 
our amended and restated declaration of trust and or bylaws  provide that we are not bound by the maryland business combination act or the control share acquisition statute 
however  in the case of the control share acquisition statute  our board of trustees may opt to make this statute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws  and may do so on a retroactive basis 
we could also opt to make the maryland business combination act applicable to us by amending our declaration of trust by a vote of a majority of our outstanding common shares 
finally  the unsolicited takeovers provisions of the mgcl permit our board of trustees  without shareholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our declaration of trust or bylaws  to implement certain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our company or of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common shares with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that shareholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests 
tax risks of our business and structure if we fail to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we will not be able to deduct our distributions  and our income will be subject to taxation  which would reduce the cash available for distribution to our shareholders 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code commencing with our short taxable year ended december  the requirements for qualification as a reit  however  are complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing reits are limited 
the reit qualification rules are even more complicated for a reit that invests through an operating partnership  in various joint ventures  in other reits and in both equity and debt investments 
our continued qualification as a reit will depend on our ability to meet various requirements concerning  among other things  the ownership of our outstanding shares of stock  the nature of our assets  the sources of our income and the amount of our distributions to our shareholders 
if we fail to meet these requirements and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions  our distributions to our shareholders will not be deductible by us and we will be subject to a corporate level tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates  substantially reduce our cash available to make distributions to our shareholders 
in addition  if we failed to qualify as a reit  we would no longer be required to make distributions for federal income tax purposes 
incurring corporate income tax liability might cause us to borrow funds  liquidate some of our investments or take other steps that could negatively affect our operating results 
moreover  if our reit status is terminated because of our failure to meet a reit qualification requirement or if we voluntarily revoke our election  unless relief provisions applicable to certain reit qualification failures apply  we would be disqualified from electing treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which reit status is lost 
we may not qualify for relief provisions for reit qualification failures and even if we can qualify for such relief  we may be required to make penalty payments  which could be significant in amount 
even if we maintain our qualification as a reit  we are subject to any applicable state  local or foreign taxes and our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates 

table of contents failure of our operating partnership to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes would result in our failure to qualify as a reit 
failure of our operating partnership or a subsidiary partnership to be treated as a partnership would have serious adverse consequences to our shareholders 
if the irs were to successfully challenge the tax status of our operating partnership or any of its subsidiary partnerships for federal income tax purposes  our operating partnership or the affected subsidiary partnership would be taxable as a corporation 
in such event  we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to reits and  accordingly  would cease to qualify as a reit 
distribution requirements relating to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes limit our flexibility in executing our business plan 
our business plan contemplates growth through acquisitions 
to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we generally are required to distribute to our shareholders at least of our reit taxable income each year 
reit taxable income is determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding net capital gains 
to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed income 
in addition  we are required to pay a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which actual distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income for that calendar year  of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of our undistributed taxable income required to be distributed from prior years 
we have distributed  and intend to continue to distribute  to our shareholders all or substantially all of our reit taxable income each year in order to comply with the distribution requirements of the internal revenue code and to eliminate all federal income tax liability at the reit level and liability for the nondeductible excise tax 
our distribution requirements limit our ability to accumulate capital for other business purposes  including funding acquisitions  debt maturities and capital expenditures 
thus  our ability to grow through acquisitions will be limited if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing 
in addition  differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses in arriving at reit taxable income and the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds or make a taxable distribution of our shares or debt securities to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 
our disposal of properties may have negative implications  including unfavorable tax consequences 
if we make a sale of a property directly or through an entity that is treated as a partnership or a disregarded entity  for federal income tax purposes  and it is deemed to be a sale of dealer property or inventory  the sale may be deemed to be a prohibited transaction under the federal income tax laws applicable to reits  in which case our gain  or our share of the gain  from the sale would be subject to a penalty tax 
if we believe that a sale of a property might be treated as a prohibited transaction  we may seek to conduct that sales activity through a taxable reit subsidiary  in which case the gain from the sale would be subject to corporate income tax but not the prohibited transaction tax 
we cannot assure you  however  that the internal revenue service will not assert successfully that sales of properties that we make directly or through an entity that is treated as a partnership or a disregarded entity  for federal income tax purposes are sales of dealer property or inventory  in which case the penalty tax would apply 
moreover  we have entered and may enter into agreements with joint venture partners or contributors to our operating partnership that require us to avoid taxable property sales and to maintain property level indebtedness on contributed properties for a period of years 
sales of properties or repayment of indebtedness may result in adverse consequences to our partners for which we may have full or partial indemnification obligations 
we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could reduce the market price of our securities 
at any time  the federal income tax laws or regulations governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations may be amended 
we cannot predict when or if any new federal income tax law  regulation or administrative interpretation  or any amendment to any existing federal income tax law  regulation or administrative interpretation  will be adopted  promulgated or become effective and any such law  regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively 
we and our shareholders  as the well as the market price of our securities  could be adversely affected by any such change in  or any new  federal income tax law  regulation or administrative interpretation 

table of contents dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 
the maximum tax rate applicable to income from qualified dividends payable to us shareholders taxed at individual rates has been reduced by legislation to through the end of dividends payable by reits  however  generally are not eligible for the reduced rates 
although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends payable by reits  the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are taxed at individual rates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non reit corporations that pay dividends  which could adversely affect the market price of the stock of reits  including our common shares 
complying with reit requirements may force us to sell otherwise attractive investments 
to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy certain requirements with respect to the character of our assets 
if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter  we must correct such failure within days after the end of the calendar quarter by  possibly  selling assets notwithstanding their prospects as an investment to avoid losing our reit status 
if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter  and the failure exceeds a de minimis threshold  we may be able to preserve our reit status if a the failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect  b we dispose of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which we identified the failure  c we file a schedule with the internal revenue service describing each asset that caused the failure  and d we pay an additional tax of the greater of  or the product of the highest applicable tax rate multiplied by the net income generated on those assets 
as a result  we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 
if we or our predecessor entity failed to qualify as an s corporation for any of our tax years prior to our initial public offering  we may fail to qualify as a reit 
to qualify as a reit  we may not have at the close of any year undistributed earnings and profits accumulated in any non reit year  including undistributed earnings and profits accumulated in any non reit year for which we or our predecessor  first potomac realty investment trust  inc  did not qualify as an s corporation 
although we believe that we and our predecessor corporation qualified as an s corporation for federal income tax purposes for all tax years prior to our initial public offering  if it is determined that we did not so qualify  we will not qualify as a reit 
any such failure to qualify may also prevent us from qualifying as a reit for any of the following four tax years 
if first potomac management  inc failed to qualify as an s corporation during any of its tax years  we may be responsible for any entity level taxes due 
we believe first potomac management  inc qualified as an s corporation for federal and state income tax purposes from the time of its incorporation in through the date it merged into our company in however  the company may be responsible for any entity level taxes imposed on first potomac management  inc if it did not qualify as an s corporation at any time prior to the merger 
first potomac management  inc s former shareholders have severally indemnified us against any such loss  however  in the event one or more of its former shareholders is unable to fulfill its indemnification obligation  we may not be reimbursed for a portion of the taxes 
risks related to an investment in our equity securities our common and preferred shares trade in a limited market which could hinder your ability to sell our common or preferred shares 
our common shares experience relatively limited trading volume  many investors  particularly institutions  may not be interested or be permitted in owning our common shares because of the inability to acquire or sell a substantial block of our common shares at one time 
this illiquidity could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares 
in addition  a shareholder may not be able to borrow funds using our common shares as collateral because lenders may be unwilling to accept the pledge of common shares having a limited market  thereby making our common shares a less attractive investment for some investors 
in addition  an active trading market on the nyse for our series a preferred shares issued in january which were our first issuance of preferred shares may not develop or  if it does develop  may not last  in which case the trading price of our series a preferred shares could be adversely affected or trade at prices lower than the initial offering price 

table of contents the market price and trading volume of our common and preferred shares may be volatile 
the market price of our common shares has been and may continue to be more volatile than in prior years and subject to wide fluctuations 
in addition  the trading volume in our common and preferred shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur 
we cannot assure you that the market price of our common and preferred shares will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future  including as a result of factors unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common and preferred shares include actual or anticipated declines in our quarterly operating results or distributions  reductions in our funds from operations  declining occupancy rates or increased tenant defaults  general market and economic conditions  including continued volatility in the financial and credit markets  increases in market interest rates that lead purchasers of our securities to demand a higher dividend yield  changes in market valuations of similar companies  adverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we incur in the future  additions or departures of key management personnel  actions by institutional shareholders  our issuance of additional debt or preferred equity securities  speculation in the press or investment community  and unanticipated charges due to the vesting of equity based compensation awards upon achievement of certain performance measures that cause our operating results to decline or fail to meet market expectations 
an increase in market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares 
one of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common shares is our distribution rate as a percentage of our share price  relative to market interest rates 
if market interest rates increase  prospective investors may desire a higher distribution rate on our common shares or seek securities paying higher dividends or interest 
the market price of our common shares likely will be based primarily on the earnings that we derive from rental income with respect to our properties and our related distributions to shareholders  and not from the underlying appraised value of the properties themselves 
as a result  interest rate fluctuations and capital market conditions can affect the market price of our common shares 
for instance  if interest rates rise without an increase in our distribution rate  the market price of our common shares could decrease because potential investors may require a higher yield on our common shares as market rates on interest bearing securities  such as bonds  rise 
in addition  rising interest rates would result in increased interest expense on our non hedged variable rate debt  thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make distributions to our shareholders 
we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and we cannot assure of our ability to pay dividends in the future or the amount of any dividends 
we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and our ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this annual report on form k and any risk factors in our subsequent securities and exchange commission filings 
for example  we significantly reduced our quarterly distribution during comparable companies to ours have also reduced and  in some cases  eliminated their distribution payments 
all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of trustees and their payment and amount will depend on our earnings  our financial condition  maintenance of our reit status  compliance with our debt covenants and other factors as our board of trustees may deem relevant from time to time 
we cannot assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future or that the distributions will be made in amounts similar to our historic distributions 
in particular  our outstanding debt  and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements  could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our equity securities  including paying dividends 
see risk factors risks related to our business and properties covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
further  distributions with respect to our common shares are subject to our ability to first satisfy our obligations to pay distributions to the holders of our series a preferred shares  and future offerings of preferred shares could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments or both that could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our common shares 
in addition  some of our distributions may include a return of capital or may be taxable distributions of our shares or debt securities 

table of contents future offerings of debt securities  which would rank senior to our common and preferred shares upon liquidation  and future offerings of equity securities  which would dilute our existing shareholders and may be senior to our common shares or senior to or on parity with our preferred shares for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions  may adversely affect the market price of our equity securities 
in the future  particularly as we seek to acquire and develop additional real estate assets consistent with our growth strategy  we may attempt to increase our capital resources through debt offerings or additional equity offerings  including senior or subordinated notes and series of preferred shares or common shares 
for example  during and  we sold approximately million common shares  million preferred shares in underwritten public offerings and approximately million common shares through our controlled equity program 
our preferred shares will rank junior to all of our existing and future debt and to other non equity claims on us and our assets available to satisfy claims against us  including claims in bankruptcy  liquidation or similar proceedings 
further  upon liquidation  holders of our debt securities and preferred shares and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common shares 
additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our equity securities  or both 
because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings 
thus  holders of our equity securities bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our equity securities and diluting their share holdings in us

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap that require the company to make certain estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require subjective or complex judgments and are the policies and estimates that the company deems most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations 
it is possible that the use of different reasonable estimates or assumptions in making these judgments could result in materially different amounts being reported in its consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition  including evaluation of the collectability of accounts and notes receivable  impairment of long lived assets  purchase accounting for acquisitions of real estate  derivative instruments and share based compensation 
the following is a summary of certain aspects of these critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition the company generates substantially all of its revenue from leases on its office and industrial properties as well as business parks 
the company recognizes rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of its leases  which includes fixed rate renewal periods leased at below market rates at acquisition or inception 
accrued straight line rents represent the difference between rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the respective lease agreements and the rental payments contractually due for leases that contain abatement or fixed periodic increases 
the company considers current information  credit quality  historical trends  economic conditions and other events regarding the tenants ability to pay their obligations in determining if amounts due from tenants  including accrued straight line rents  are ultimately collectible 
the uncollectible portion of the amounts due from tenants  including accrued straight line rents  is charged to property operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
tenant leases generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the company for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by the company 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period in which the expenses are incurred 
the company records a provision for losses on estimated uncollectible accounts receivable based on its analysis of risk of loss on specific accounts 
lease termination fees are recognized on the date of termination when the related lease or portion thereof is cancelled  the collectability of the fee is reasonably assured and the company has possession of the terminated space 
accounts and notes receivable the company must make estimates of the collectability of its accounts and notes receivable related to minimum rent  deferred rent  tenant reimbursements  lease termination fees and interest and other income 
the company specifically analyzes accounts and notes receivable and historical bad debt experience  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates have a direct impact on the company s net income as a higher required allowance for doubtful accounts receivable will result in lower net income 
the uncollectible portion of the amounts due from tenants  including straight line rents  is charged to property operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
the company considers similar criteria in assessing impairment associated with outstanding loans or notes receivable and whether any allowance for anticipated credit loss is appropriate 
investments in real estate and real estate entities investments in real estate and real estate entities are initially recorded at fair value if acquired in a business combination or carried at initial cost when constructed or acquired in an asset purchase  less accumulated depreciation and  when appropriate  impairment losses 
improvements and replacements are capitalized at fair value when they extend the useful life  increase capacity or improve the efficiency of the asset 
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives of the company s assets  by class  are as follows buildings years building improvements to years furniture  fixtures and equipment to years tenant improvements shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the terms of the related leases lease related intangible assets term of related lease 
table of contents the company regularly reviews market conditions for possible impairment of a property s carrying value 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions  changes in management s intended holding period or potential sale to a third party indicate a possible impairment of the fair value of a property  an impairment analysis is performed 
the company assesses potential impairments based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition 
this estimate is based on projections of future revenues  expenses  capital improvement costs  expected holding periods and capitalization rates 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected market trends and leasing prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment based on forecasted undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
the company is required to make estimates as to whether there are impairments in the carrying values of its investments in real estate 
further  the company will record an impairment loss if it expects to dispose of a property  in the near term  at a price below carrying value 
in such an event  the company will record an impairment loss based on the difference between a property s carrying value and its projected sales price  less any estimated costs to sell 
the company will classify a building as held for sale in the period in which it has made the decision to dispose of the building  the company s board of trustees or a designated delegate has approved the sale  there is a high likelihood a binding agreement to purchase the property will be signed under which the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash and no significant financing contingencies exist that could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner 
if these criteria are met  the company will cease depreciation of the asset 
the company will classify any impairment loss  together with the building s operating results  as discontinued operations in its consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented and classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale in its consolidated balance sheets in the period the sale criteria are met 
interest expense is reclassified to discontinued operations only to the extent the held for sale property is secured by specific mortgage debt and the mortgage debt will not be assigned to another property owned by the company after the disposition 
the company recognizes the fair value  if sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate the fair value  of any liability for conditional asset retirement obligations when incurred  which is generally upon acquisition  construction  development or redevelopment and or through the normal operation of the asset 
the company capitalizes interest costs incurred on qualifying expenditures for real estate assets under development or redevelopment  which include assets owned through unconsolidated joint ventures that are under development or redevelopment  while being readied for their intended use in accordance with accounting requirements regarding capitalization of interest 
the company will capitalize interest when qualifying expenditures for the asset have been made  activities necessary to get the asset ready for its intended use are in progress and interest costs are being incurred 
capitalized interest also includes interest associated with expenditures incurred to acquire developable land while development activities are in progress and interest on the direct compensation costs of the company s construction personnel who manage the development and redevelopment projects  but only to the extent the employee s time can be allocated to a project 
any portion of construction management costs not directly attributable to a specific project are recognized as general and administrative expense in the period incurred 
the company does not capitalize any other general administrative costs such as office supplies  office rent expense or an overhead allocation to its development or redevelopment projects 
capitalized compensation costs were immaterial during  and capitalization of interest will end when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use  but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity  if the property is not occupied 
the company will also place redevelopment and development assets in service at this time and commence depreciation upon the substantial completion of tenant improvements and the recognition of revenue 
capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying assets  commencing when those assets are placed into service 
purchase accounting acquisitions of rental property from third parties are accounted for at fair value 
any liabilities assumed or incurred are recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition 
the fair value of the acquired property is allocated between land and building on an as if vacant basis based on management s estimate of the fair value of those components for each type of property and to tenant improvements based on the depreciated replacement cost of the tenant improvements  which approximates their fair value 
the fair value of the in place leases is recorded as follows the fair value of leases in place on the date of acquisition is based on absorption costs for the estimated lease up period in which vacancy and foregone revenue are avoided due to the presence of the acquired leases  the fair value of above and below market in place leases based on the present value using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between the contractual rent amounts to be paid under the assumed lease and the estimated market lease rates for the corresponding spaces over the remaining non cancelable terms of the related leases  which range from one to fifteen years  and the fair value of intangible tenant or customer relationships 

table of contents the company s determination of these fair values requires it to estimate market rents for each of the leases and make certain other assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the rental revenue  and depreciation and amortization expense recognized for these leases and associated intangible assets and liabilities 
derivative instruments in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes 
the company may enter into derivative agreements to mitigate exposure to unexpected changes in interest rates and may use interest rate protection or cap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate changes 
the company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and intends to enter into derivative agreements only with counterparties that it believes have a strong credit rating to mitigate the risk of counterparty default or insolvency 
the company may designate a derivative as either a hedge of the cash flows from a debt instrument or anticipated transaction cash flow hedge or a hedge of the fair value of a debt instrument fair value hedge 
all derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities at fair value 
for effective hedging relationships  the change in the fair value of the assets or liabilities is recorded within equity cash flow hedge or through earnings fair value hedge 
ineffective portions of derivative transactions will result in changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
for a cash flow hedge  the company records its proportionate share of unrealized gains or losses on its derivative instruments associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures within equity and investment in affiliates 
the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  the company has considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual inputs and guarantees 
share based compensation the company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
for options awards  the company uses a black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on an assessment of the company s realized volatility over the preceding five years  which is equivalent to the awards expected life 
the expected term represents the period of time the options are anticipated to remain outstanding as well as the company s historical experience for groupings of employees that have similar behavior and considered separately for valuation purposes 
for non vested share awards that vest over a predetermined time period  the company uses the outstanding share price at the date of issuance to fair value the awards 
for non vested shares awards that vest based on performance conditions  the company uses a monte carlo simulation risk neutral approach to determine the value and derived service period of each tranche 
the expense associated with the share based awards will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
the fair value for all share based payment transactions are recognized as a component of income or loss from continuing operations

as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the senior notes was 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the senior notes 
see financial covenants below for additional information regarding the financial covenants under the senior notes 
financial covenants the company s outstanding corporate debt agreements contain specific financial covenants that may impact future financing decisions made by the company or may be impacted by a decline in operations 
these covenants differ by debt instrument and relate to the company s allowable leverage  minimum tangible net worth  fixed charge coverage and other financial metrics 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants of its outstanding debt agreements 
at december   the company was near the required ratios or thresholds for certain of the covenants  including the consolidated debt yield and distribution payout ratio under the senior notes  the unencumbered pool leverage ratio of the revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan  and the maximum consolidated total indebtedness under the revolving credit facility  unsecured term loan  secured term loan and senior notes 
the consolidated debt yield covenant under the senior notes is currently being impacted by three significant factors vacancy in certain of the company s operating properties and related tenant improvement costs incurred in connection with the lease up those properties  the impact of acquisition costs and the company s overall leverage levels 
the impact of acquisition costs is unique to the calculation of the consolidated debt yield covenant in the senior notes 
as a result of the stress on the consolidated debt yield covenant  the company may be limited in its ability to pursue additional developments  redevelopments or acquisitions that may not be initially accretive to its results of operations but would otherwise be in the best interests of the company s shareholders 
the dividend payout ratio covenant under the senior notes also is currently impacted by  among other things  impairment charges  which reduce ffo solely for purposes of this covenant 
table of contents calculation 
as such  the company may be required to limit or restrict its ability to sell underperforming properties  which may otherwise be in the best interests of the shareholders  and or curtail its distributions to common shareholders if the company otherwise determines that the dividend payout ratio would be adversely impacted 
in addition  as a result of the stress on these covenants  the company s ability to draw on the revolving credit facility or incur other additional debt may be limited  and the company may be forced to raise additional equity to repay the senior notes or other debt 
moreover  the company s continued ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to compliance with financial and operating covenants  and a failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit facility 
as noted above  the company is near the required ratios or thresholds for certain of the financial covenants in its debt agreements and can provide no assurance that it will be able to continue to comply with these covenants in future periods 
these debt agreements also contain cross default provisions that would be triggered if the company is in default under other loans in excess of certain amounts 
for example  an event of default under the senior notes would create an event of default under our other senior debt instruments 
in the event of a default  the lenders could accelerate the timing of payments under the debt obligations and the company may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources  which may not be available on attractive terms  or at all  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  financial condition  results of operations and ability to make distributions to our shareholders

the maximum dividend payout ratio under the senior notes includes impairment write downs of depreciable assets for the calculation of ffo 

table of contents the company and the holders of the senior notes had a disagreement regarding the appropriate calculations of the consolidated debt yield and dividend payout ratio covenants 
this disagreement related to  among other things  the treatment of acquisition costs in the calculation of the consolidated debt yield covenant and the treatment of impairment costs in the calculation of ffo in connection with the dividend payout ratio 
although the company was in compliance with both covenants as of december   the company can provide no assurance that the noteholders will not seek to declare an event of default and accelerate maturity of the senior notes 
the company  has and will calculate the covenants using only the noteholders methodology 
derivative financial instruments the company is exposed to certain risks arising from business operations and economic factors 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities in which its future exposure to interest rate fluctuations is unknown 
the objective in the use of an interest rate derivative is to add stability to interest expenses and manage exposure to interest rate changes 
no hedging activity can completely insulate the company from the risks associated with changes in interest rates 
moreover  interest rate hedging could fail to protect the company or adversely affect it because  among other things available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which the company seeks protection  the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability  the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay  and the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs the company s ability to sell or assign its side of the hedging transaction 
the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure on its variable rate debt against fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
the interest rate swap agreements fix libor to a specified interest rate  however  the swap agreements do not affect the contractual spreads associated with each variable debt instrument s applicable interest rate

funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a non gaap measure used by many investors and analysts that follow the real estate industry 
the company considers ffo a useful measure of performance for an equity reit because it facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of its properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization  which assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  the company believes that ffo provides a meaningful indication of its performance 
management also considers ffo an appropriate supplemental performance measure given its wide use by and relevance to investors and analysts 
ffo  reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions  principally adjusts for the effects of gaap depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  which assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  represents net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses on sales of real estate and impairments of real estate assets  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo in accordance with nareit s definition  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo  or similarly titled measures  used by other companies and this may not be comparable to those presentations 
historically  the company did not exclude impairments in its computation of ffo 
however  on october   nareit clarified that the exclusion of impairment write downs of depreciable assets in reported ffo was always intended and appropriate 
as a result  the company will exclude impairments from ffo in future periods and has restated historical ffo to exclude such charges consistent with nareit s guidance 
in addition  the company s methodology for computing ffo adds back noncontrolling interests in the income from its operating partnership in determining ffo 
the company believes this is appropriate as operating partnership units are presented on an as converted  one for one basis for shares of stock in determining ffo per diluted share 
ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
the company s presentation of ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of its liquidity
