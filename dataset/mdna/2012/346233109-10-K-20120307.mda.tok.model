results of operations for the years ended  and a summary of our consolidated results by business segment follows for the year in thousands revenues real estate mineral resources fiber resources total revenues segment earnings loss real estate mineral resources fiber resources total segment earnings loss items not allocated to segments general and administrative expense share based compensation expense gain on sale of assets interest expense other non operating income income before taxes income tax expense net income attributable to forestar group inc significant aspects of our results of operations follow real estate segment earnings were negatively impacted by  of non cash impairment charges principally associated with residential development projects located near atlanta  denver  and the texas gulf coast and with our decision to acquire certain assets from cl realty and temco  ventures in which we own a percent interest 
segment earnings were positively impacted by increased undeveloped land sales and higher residential lot and tract sales and by  as result of settled litigation and reallocation from us to noncontrolling financial interests of a previously recognized loss related to foreclosure of a lien on a property owned by a consolidated venture 
mineral resources segment earnings declined primarily due to lower lease bonus revenues and increased costs associated with developing our water resources initiatives 
these items were partially offset by increased oil production volumes and higher average oil prices 
fiber resources segment earnings continued to decrease principally due to lower harvest volume as a result of selling over  acres of timberland since year end 
table of contents general and administrative expenses include  associated with proposed private debt offerings that we withdrew as a result of deterioration of terms available to us in the credit markets 
share based compensation decreased principally as a result of a decline in our stock price and its impact on cash settled awards 
gain on sale of assets represents the sale of about  acres of timberland in georgia  alabama and texas for  in accordance with our strategic initiatives which  we completed in real estate segment earnings declined principally due to lower undeveloped land sales from our retail sales program and due to  of non cash impairment charges principally associated with residential development projects located near atlanta and fort worth  and with a commercial real estate project near the texas gulf coast 
mineral resources segment earnings declined principally due to lower lease bonus revenues as a result of reduced leasing activity by exploration and production companies that concentrated investments in drilling activities to hold existing leases rather than leasing new mineral interests in our basins 
this decline in lease bonus revenue was partially offset by increased oil and natural gas production and higher oil prices  including our share of venture activity 
fiber resources segment earnings decreased principally due to reduced harvest activity resulting from the sale of over  acres of timberland since first quarter and postponing harvest plans on about  acres classified as held for sale 
gain on sale of assets represents the sale of about  acres of timber and timberland in georgia  alabama and texas for  in accordance with our strategic initiatives 
interest expense decreased principally due to lower interest rates as a result of the maturity of our interest rate swap agreement  lower average debt levels outstanding and decreased amortization of prepaid loan fees due to refinancing and extending our senior credit facility 
real estate segment earnings were negatively impacted by  of non cash impairment charges principally associated with a residential condominium project located in austin  two projects located in tampa  and an equity investment in an unconsolidated venture 
segment earnings were also negatively impacted by  in environmental remediation activities 
mineral resources segment earnings declined principally due to lower royalty revenues as result of lower natural gas and oil prices  and to a lesser extent  lower lease bonus revenues from decreased leasing activity and increased infrastructure costs associated with developing our mineral resources organization 
fiber resources segment earnings increased principally due to increased harvest volumes and higher prices related to a higher mix of larger pine sawtimber sold from our texas forest 
general and administrative expenses include about  paid to outside advisors regarding an evaluation by our board of directors of an unsolicited shareholder proposal and  in non cash impairment charges related to the sale of our undivided percent interest in corporate aircraft contributed to us by temple inland at spin off

table of contents current market conditions current us market conditions in the single family residential industry continue to be challenging  characterized by high unemployment rates  low consumer confidence  depressed sales volumes and prices  difficult financing environment for purchasers and competition from foreclosure inventory 
it is difficult to predict when and at what rate these broader negative conditions will improve  or when the homebuilding industry will experience a sustained recovery 
however  declining finished lot inventories and lack of real estate development is increasing demand for our developed lots  principally in the texas markets 
multifamily market conditions are improving  with many markets experiencing healthy occupancy levels and positive rent growth 
this improvement has been driven primarily by limited new construction activity  reduced single family mortgage credit availability  and the increased propensity to rent among the to year old demographic of the us population 
oil prices have increased principally due to supply uncertainty  demand growth from emerging markets and ongoing political unrest in oil producing regions 
natural gas prices have remained soft due to increased levels of production and record levels of inventory due to mild temperatures 
shale resource drilling and production remains strong and working natural gas inventories are expected to remain relatively high 
in the east texas basin  exploration and production companies continue to focus drilling on natural gas prospects in order to extend and hold existing mineral leases 
in the gulf coast basin  in louisiana  activity has increased as operators have shifted exploration efforts to oil and high liquid natural gas plays 
these conditions may impact the demand for new mineral leases  new exploration activity and the amount of royalty revenues we receive 
pulpwood and sawtimber sales are depressed due to high levels of fiber inventory from lower demand as a result of the overall slowdown in residential construction activity 
business segments we manage our operations through three business segments real estate  mineral resources  and fiber resources 
we evaluate performance based on earnings before unallocated items and income taxes 
segment earnings loss consist of operating income  equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated ventures and net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 
unallocated items consist of general and administrative expenses  share based compensation  gain on sale of assets  interest expense and other non operating income and expense 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the accounting policy note to the consolidated financial statements 
we operate in cyclical industries 
our operations are affected to varying degrees by supply and demand factors and economic conditions including changes in interest rates  availability of mortgage credit  consumer and home builder sentiment  new housing starts  real estate values  employment levels  changes in the market prices for oil  natural gas  and timber  and the overall strength or weakness of the us economy 
real estate we own directly or through ventures about  acres of real estate located in nine states and markets

in as a result of entering into the agreement with cl realty to acquire certain assets  we offset  of deferred gains against our share of venture losses 
in  equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated ventures includes about  in gains that were previously deferred by us due to our continuing involvement with the property which was sold to a third party 
in  segment earnings loss include a benefit of  as a result of settled litigation and  associated with reallocation of a previously recognized loss related to a foreclosure of a lien on a property owned by a consolidated venture 
based on new information  we determined this loss should be allocated from us to the noncontrolling financial interests as we believe the likelihood we will be subject to any potential lender liabilities related to this foreclosure is remote 
revenues in our owned and consolidated ventures consist of for the year in thousands residential real estate commercial real estate undeveloped land income producing properties other total revenues residential real estate revenues principally consist of the sale of single family developed lots to national  regional and local homebuilders 
in  residential real estate revenues increased principally as a result of higher lot sales volume due to demand for finished lot inventory by homebuilders in markets where supply has diminished 
in addition  in  we sold entitled acres from two residential projects located near dallas  texas for  which generated  in segment earnings 
these were the final tracts available for sale in these projects and represented approximately undeveloped lots 
in and  residential real estate revenues declined principally as a result of decreased demand for single family lots due to the overall decline in the housing industry 

table of contents commercial real estate revenues continue to be impacted by limited availability of commercial real estate acquisition and development mortgages to potential third party purchasers 
in  undeveloped land sales increased principally due to the sale of about  acres in georgia for  this sale represented a bulk retail transaction of several non contiguous tracts and resulted in segment earnings of about  in both and  market conditions for retail land sales remained challenging due to limited credit availability  low consumer confidence and alternate investment options to buyers in the marketplace 
in  the average price per acre sold increased principally as a result of selling about acres of land in the entitlement process in georgia for about  per acre 
in  we sold  acres from our owned and consolidated ventures at an average price of  per acre  generating about  in revenues

our contractual obligations due in will likely be paid from operating cash flows and from borrowings under our senior credit facility 
interest payments on debt include interest payments related to our fixed rate debt and estimated interest payments related to our variable rate debt 
estimated interest payments on variable rate debt were calculated assuming that the outstanding balances and interest rates that existed at year end remain constant through maturity 
purchase obligations are defined as legally binding and enforceable agreements to purchase goods and services 
our purchase obligations include commitments for land acquisition and land development  engineering and construction contracts for development and service contracts 
in  we began construction on a unit multifamily project in austin in which the estimated total cost  including land  is approximately  at year end  our investment in this project is  and the total cost to complete construction is  which includes both contracted and un contracted costs 
our operating leases are for timberland  facilities  equipment and groundwater 
in  we entered into a year agreement to lease approximately  square feet in austin  texas as our corporate headquarters 
at year end  the remaining contractual obligation is  also included in operating leases is a long term timber lease of over  acres that has a remaining lease term of years and a remaining contractual obligation of  and about  acres of groundwater leases with remaining contractual obligations of  we have other long term liabilities that are not included in the table because they do not have scheduled maturities 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements to facilitate our operating activities 
at year end  our off balance sheet unfunded arrangements  excluding contractual interest payments  purchase obligations  operating lease obligations and venture contributions included in the table of contractual obligations  consist of payments due or expiring by year total thereafter in thousands performance bonds standby letters of credit recourse obligations total performance bonds  letters of credit and recourse obligations are primarily for our real estate development activities and include  of performance bonds and letters of credit we provided on behalf of certain ventures 
our venture partners also provide performance bonds and letters of credit 
generally these performance bonds or letters of credit would be drawn on due to lack of specific performance by us or the ventures  such as failure to deliver streets and utilities in accordance with local codes and ordinances 
at year end  we participate in three partnerships that have total assets of  and total liabilities of  which includes  of borrowings classified as current maturities 
these partnerships are managed by third parties who intend to extend or refinance these borrowings  however  there is no assurance that this can be done 
although these borrowings are guaranteed by third parties  we may under certain circumstances elect or be required to provide additional equity to these partnerships 
we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a significant effect on our earnings or financial position 
our investment in these partnerships is  at year end these three partnerships are variable interest entities 
cibolo canyons san antonio  texas cibolo canyons consists of the jw marriott san antonio hill country resort spa development owned by third parties and a mixed use development we own 
we have about  invested in cibolo canyons at year end resort hotel  spa and golf development in  we entered into agreements to facilitate third party construction and ownership of the jw marriott san antonio hill country resort spa  which includes a  room destination resort and two pga tour tournament players club tpc golf courses 
under these agreements  we agreed to transfer to third party owners acres of undeveloped land  to provide  cash and to provide  of other consideration principally consisting of golf course construction materials  substantially all of which has been provided 
in exchange for our commitment to the resort  the third party owners assigned to us certain rights under an agreement between the third party owners and a legislatively created special improvement district sid 
this agreement includes the right to receive from the sid percent of hotel occupancy revenues and percent of other resort sales revenues collected as taxes by the sid through the amount we receive will be net of annual ad valorem tax reimbursements by the sid to the third party owners of the resort through in addition  these payments will be net of debt service  if any  on bonds issued by the sid collateralized by hotel occupancy tax and other resort sales tax through the amounts we collect under this agreement are dependent on several factors including the amount of revenues generated by and ad valorem taxes imposed on the resort and the amount of any applicable debt service 
table of contents incurred by the sid 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to the amount and timing of collections under this agreement 
until these uncertainties are clarified  amounts collected under the agreement will be accounted for as a reduction of our investment in the resort development 
the resort began operations on january in  we received  related to our share of hotel occupancy revenues and other resort sales revenues collected as taxes by the sid 
since inception  we have received  in reimbursements and have accounted for this as a reduction of our investment 
at year end  we have  invested in the resort development 
mixed use development the mixed use development we own consists of  acres planned to include about  residential lots and about commercial acres designated for multifamily and retail uses  of which lots and commercial acres have been sold through year end in  we entered into an agreement with the sid providing for reimbursement of certain infrastructure costs related to the mixed use development 
reimbursements are subject to review and approval by the sid and unreimbursed amounts accrue interest at percent 
the sid s funding for reimbursements is principally derived from its ad valorem tax collections and bond proceeds collateralized by ad valorem taxes  less debt service on these bonds and annual administrative and public service expenses 
because the amount of each reimbursement is dependent on several factors  including timing of sid approval and the sid having an adequate tax base to generate funds that can be used to reimburse us  there is uncertainty as to the amount and timing of reimbursements under this agreement 
we expect to recover our investment from lot and tract sales and reimbursement of approved infrastructure costs from the sid 
we have not recognized income from interest due  but not collected 
as these uncertainties are clarified  we will modify our accounting accordingly 
through year end  we have submitted and received approval for reimbursement of about  of infrastructure costs and have received reimbursements totaling  of which  was received in   in and  in  all were accounted for as a reduction of our investment in the mixed use development 
at year end  we have  in approved and pending reimbursements  excluding interest 
at year end  we have  invested in the mixed use development 
accounting policies critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements  we follow generally accepted accounting principles  which in many cases require us to make assumptions  estimates  and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
many of these principles are relatively straightforward 
there are  however  a few accounting policies that are critical because they are important in determining our financial condition and results of operations and involve significant assumptions  estimates and judgments that are difficult to determine 
we must make these assumptions  estimates and judgments currently about matters that are inherently uncertain  such as future economic conditions  operating results and valuations  as well as our intentions 
as the difficulty increases  the level of precision decreases  meaning actual results can  and probably will  differ from those currently estimated 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on a combination of historical experiences and other factors that we believe are reasonable 
we have reviewed the selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with our audit committee 
investment in real estate and cost of real estate sales in allocating costs to real estate owned and real estate sold  we must estimate current and future real estate values 
our estimates of future real estate values sometimes must extend over periods to years from today and are dependent on numerous 
table of contents assumptions including our intentions and future market and economic conditions 
in addition  when we sell real estate from projects that are not finished  we must estimate future development costs through completion 
differences between our estimates and actual results will affect future carrying values and operating results 
impairment of long lived assets measuring assets for impairment requires estimating future fair values based on our intentions as to holding periods  future operating cash flows and the residual value of assets under review  primarily undeveloped land 
depending on the asset under review  we use varying methods to determine fair value  such as discounting expected future cash flows  determining resale values by market  or applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
changes in economic conditions  demand for real estate  and the projected net operating income for a specific property will inevitably change our estimates 
share based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of other variables 
these variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors term of option  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we have limited historical experience as a stand alone company so we utilized alternative methods in determining our valuation assumptions 
the expected life was based on the simplified method utilizing the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual life of the awards 
in  the expected stock price volatility was based on a blended rate utilizing our historical volatility and historical prices of our peers common stock for a period corresponding to the expected life of the options 
in and  the expected stock price volatility was based on historical prices of our peers common stock for a period corresponding to the expected life of the options 
pre vesting forfeitures are estimated based upon the pool of participants and their expected activity and historical trends 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant judgment is required to estimate our income taxes 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws 
we estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
if needed  we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in addition  when we believe a tax position is supportable but the outcome uncertain  we include the item in our tax return but do not recognize the related benefit in our provision for taxes 
instead  we record a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits  which represents our expectation of the most likely outcome considering the technical merits and specific facts of the position 
changes to liabilities are only made when an event occurs that changes the most likely outcome  such as settlement with the relevant tax authority  expiration of statutes of limitations  changes in tax law  or recent court rulings 
adjustments to temporary differences  permanent differences or uncertain tax positions could materially impact our financial position  cash flow and results of operation 
oil and natural gas reserves the estimation of oil and natural gas reserves is a significant estimate 
on an annual basis  our consulting petroleum engineering firm  with our assistance  prepares estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves based on available geologic and seismic data  reservoir pressure data  core analysis reports  well logs  analogous reservoir performance history  production data and other available sources of engineering  geological and geophysical information 
oil and natural gas prices are volatile and largely affected by worldwide or domestic production and consumption and are outside our control 
adopted and pending accounting pronouncements we adopted three new accounting pronouncements in  the adoption of which did not have a significant effect on our earnings or financial position 
there are three pending accounting pronouncements that we will be required to adopt in and adoption is not anticipated to have a significant effect on our earnings or financial position 
please read note new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents effects of inflation inflation has had minimal effects on operating results the past three years 
our real estate  timber  and property and equipment are carried at historical costs 
if carried at current replacement costs  the cost of real estate sold  timber cut  and depreciation expense would have been significantly higher than what we reported 
legal proceedings we are involved in various legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of doing business 
we believe we have established adequate reserves for any probable losses  and we do not believe that the outcome of any of these proceedings should have a material adverse effect on our financial position  long term results of operations  or cash flow 
it is possible  however  that charges related to these matters could be significant to results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest rate risk is principally related to our variable rate debt 
interest rate changes impact earnings due to the resulting increase or decrease in our variable rate debt  which was  at year end and  at year end the following table illustrates the estimated effect on our pre tax income of immediate  parallel  and sustained shifts in interest rates for the next months on our variable rate debt at year end  with comparative year end information 
this estimate assumes that debt reductions from contractual payments will be replaced with short term  variable rate debt  however  that may not be the financing alternative we choose 
at year end change in interest rates in thousands foreign currency risk we have no exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
commodity price risk we have no significant exposure to commodity price fluctuations
