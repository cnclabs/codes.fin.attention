item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars and gallons in thousands  except per share amounts please read the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this form k 
overview the company operates convenience stores under the name casey s general store in eleven midwestern states  primarily iowa  missouri and illinois 
on april   there were a total of  stores in operation 
all stores offer gasoline for sale on a self serve basis and carry a broad selection of food including freshly prepared foods such as pizza  donuts and sandwiches  beverages  tobacco products  health and beauty aids  automotive products and other non food items 
we derive our revenue from the retail sale of gasoline and the products offered in our stores 
approximately of all casey s general stores are located in areas with populations of fewer than  persons  while approximately of all stores are located in communities with populations exceeding  persons 
we operate a central warehouse  the casey s distribution center  adjacent to our corporate headquarters facility in ankeny  iowa  through which we supply grocery and general merchandise items to our stores 
at april   the company owned the land at  store locations and the buildings at  locations  and leased the land at locations and the buildings at locations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company earned in basic earnings per share compared to per share for the same quarter a year ago 
fiscal basic earnings per share were versus for the prior year 
the fiscal year end results include approximately million in costs pertaining to the company s recapitalization plan completed in the second quarter of fiscal as well as the unsolicited hostile offer and related actions by alimentation couche tard inc the post tax impact on earnings was  using the income tax rate which was the effective rate on those expenses after assessing their deductibility for income tax purposes within the subsidiary that the activity occurred in 
without those costs  year to date earnings would have been per share last year using a weighted average share count of  we made this non gaap calculation to assist investors in comparing the financial performance of the company without the non operational costs associated with the unsolicited hostile offer 
the company s business is seasonal  and generally the company experiences higher sales and profitability during the first and second fiscal quarters may october  when customers tend to purchase greater quantities of gasoline and certain convenience items such as beer and soft drinks 
during the fiscal year  we acquired convenience stores from other parties and completed new store constructions 
in addition to this activity  the company also replaced stores and closed stores during the year 
the fourth quarter results reflected a increase in same store gasoline gallons sold  with an average margin of approximately cents per gallon 
for the fiscal year  same store gallons decreased with an average margin of cents per gallon 
the company s policy is to price to the competition  so the timing of retail price changes is driven by local competitive conditions 
same store sales of grocery and other merchandise increased and prepared foods and fountain increased during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company has several energy initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses associated with energy consumption 
the company believes that reducing energy consumption where feasible is a sound long term business strategy 
while individually and in aggregate the financial impact of these initiatives may not be material  implementing them throughout our operations is a part of our overall expense management 
below is a list of some of the energy initiatives the company is currently undertaking we are pursuing leed certification for the current new store design  and we expect we will obtain this in fiscal all newly constructed stores use percent high efficiency led lighting 
also  when we perform a major remodel of an existing store  the fluorescent lighting is replaced with led lighting 
furthermore  new canopies over the fuel pumps are installed with time systems and photo eyes to help control the canopy lighting 

table of contents multiple paperless initiatives are going on throughout the company  including going to paperless paystubs and w s where state law allows 
electric fuel tank heaters have been installed in our fleet of trucks  significantly reducing idle time 
futhermore  timers have been installed that automatically turn off the engine if it is idling for more than ten minutes 
all of our store managers receive a portion of their pay in the form of incentive compensation 
this encourages store managers to efficiently manage operating expenses  including utility expenses 
all levels of supervision including executive officers and supervisory personnel within the store operations department receive some form of incentive compensation  and operating expenses have a direct impact on the amount of annual incentive compensation payments made to these employees 
for further information concerning the company s operating environment and certain conditions that may affect future performance  see the forward looking statements at the end of this item 
table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal total revenue for fiscal increased to  primarily due to a increase in average gas prices  an increase in the number of gallons sold  and an increase in same store inside sales grocery other merchandise and prepared food fountain

the gas margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to the increase in the retail price per gallon of gasoline sold 
the grocery other merchandise margin increased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal the prepared food fountain margin decreased to from primarily due to the higher commodity costs during fiscal operating expenses increased in fiscal after adjusting for the million in expenses associated with the unsolicited hostile offer by couche tard in the prior year  expenses increased primarily due to the major remodels  the hour conversions  the expansion of our pizza delivery program and a greater number of stores in operation 
higher retail gasoline prices resulted in higher sales  which decreased the operating expense ratio to of total revenue in fiscal from in the prior year 
higher retail gasoline prices also increased our transportation costs and credit card fees during the year 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was due to capital expenditures made in fiscal the effective tax rate decreased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to higher federal tax credits for the current year 
however  this result was partially offset by a higher taxable income 
net earnings increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the  post tax impact on fiscal net earnings pertaining to the company s recapitalization plan as well as the unsolicited hostile offer and related actions by alimentation couche tard  inc  an increase in same store inside sales  the increase in the number of gasoline gallons sold  the hour conversions  the major remodels  the expansion of our pizza delivery program  and a greater number of stores in operation from the prior year

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal total revenue for fiscal increased to  primarily due to a increase in average gas prices  an increase in the number of gallons sold  and an increase in same store inside sales grocery other merchandise and prepared food fountain 
retail gasoline sales for the fiscal year were  an increase of  and gallons sold increased to  inside sales increased to  primarily due to increases in the cigarette and fountain sub categories and a greater number of stores in operation 
total gross profit margin was for fiscal compared with for the prior year 
the gas margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to the increase in the retail price per gallon of gasoline sold 
the grocery other merchandise margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to a more competitive cigarette pricing environment 
the prepared food fountain margin decreased to from primarily due to the higher commodity costs during fiscal operating expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to an increase of  in pre tax charges related to the evaluation of and responses to the unsolicited offer and related actions by alimentation couche tard and the evaluation of the proposal from eleven 
in fiscal  the company received a  rebate of contractual amounts of credit card transaction fees which should have been recorded in prior periods 
when the impact of those two items are excluded  operating expenses would have increased for the year 
higher retail gasoline prices resulted in higher sales  which decreased the operating expense ratio to of total revenue in fiscal from in the prior year 
higher retail gasoline prices also increased our transportation costs and credit card fees during the year 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was due to capital expenditures made in fiscal the effective tax rate increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an upward adjustment to net deferred tax liabilities resulting from a significant income tax rate increase enacted for one state that normally contributes a substantial proportion of state income tax expense and the absence  as present in the prior year  of a tax benefit resulting from a change in an uncertain tax position relating to a refund of tax credits 
net earnings decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to an increase in operating expenses from the prior year  an increase in interest expense due to the additional  principal amount outstanding on the senior notes  the loss on the early retirement of the senior notes and the to senior notes  a decrease in the average margin on prepared food fountain sales and a decrease in the average margin on grocery other merchandise sales 
however  this was partially offset by an increase in the gross profit margin per gallon of gasoline sold

individual store comparisons include only those stores that had been in operation for at least one full year on april of the fiscal year indicated 
retail gasoline profit margins have a substantial impact on our net income 
profit margins on gasoline sales can be adversely affected by factors beyond our control  including oversupply in the retail gasoline market  uncertainty or volatility in the wholesale gasoline market  and price competition from other gasoline marketers 
any substantial decrease in profit margins on retail gasoline sales or the number of gallons sold could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
average operating income represents retail sales less cost of goods sold and operating expenses attributable to a particular store  it excludes federal and state income taxes  company operating expenses not attributable to a particular store  and our matching contribution paid to the k plan 

table of contents same store sales growth by category years ended april  gasoline gallons grocery other merchandise prepared food fountain the same store sales comparison includes aggregated individual store results for all stores open throughout both periods presented 
when comparing quarterly data the store must be open for each entire quarter 
when comparing annual data  the store must be open for each entire fiscal year being compared 
remodeled stores that remained open or were closed for just a very brief period of time less than a week during the period being compared remain in the same store sales comparison 
if a store is replaced  either at the same location razed and rebuilt or relocated to a new location  it is removed from the comparison until the new store has been open for each entire period being compared 
newly constructed and acquired stores do not enter the calculation until they are open for each entire period being compared as well 

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that we believe are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective judgments  often because of the need to estimate the effects of inherently uncertain factors 
inventory inventories  which consist of merchandise and gasoline  are stated at the lower of cost or market 
for gasoline  cost is determined through the use of the first in  first out fifo method 
for merchandise inventories  cost is determined through the use of the last in  first out lifo method for financial and income tax reporting applied to inventory values determined primarily by our fifo accounting system for warehouse inventories and the retail inventory method rim for store inventories  except for cigarettes  beer  pop  and prepared foods  which are valued at cost 
rim is an averaging method widely used in the retail industry because of its practicality 
under rim  inventory valuations are at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to sales 
inherent in the rim calculations are certain management judgments and estimates that could affect the ending inventory valuation at cost and the resulting gross margins 
vendor allowances include rebates and other funds received from vendors to promote their products 
we often receive such allowances on the basis of quantitative contract terms that vary by product and vendor or directly on the basis of purchases made 
rebates are recognized as reductions of inventory costs when purchases are made  reimbursements of an operating expense eg  advertising are recorded as reductions of the related expense 
long lived assets the company periodically monitors closed and underperforming stores for an indication that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value 
fair value is based on management s estimate of the future cash flows to be generated and the amount that could be realized from the sale of assets in a current transaction between willing parties  which are considered level inputs 
the estimate is derived from offers  actual sale or disposition of assets subsequent to year end  and other indications of fair value 
in determining whether an asset is impaired  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets  which for us is generally on a store by store basis 
we recorded impairment charges of in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal self insurance we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  general liability  and automobile claims 
the self insurance claim liability is determined actuarially based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
actuarial projections of the losses are employed due to the high degree of variability in the liability estimates 
some factors affecting the uncertainty of claims include the development time frame  settlement patterns  litigation and adjudication direction  and medical treatment and cost trends 
the liability is not discounted 
the balance of our self insurance reserves were  and  for the years ended april  and  respectively 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually 
the company assesses impairment annually at year end using a market based approach to establish fair value 
all of the goodwill assigned to the individual stores is aggregated into a single reporting unit due to the similar economic characteristics of the stores 
as of april   there was  of goodwill and management s analysis of recoverability completed as of the fiscal year end yielded no evidence of impairment and no events have occurred since the annual test indicating a potential impairment 
liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of our business  cash provided by operations is our primary source of liquidity 
we finance our inventory purchases primarily from normal trade credit aided by relatively rapid inventory turnover 
this turnover allows us to conduct operations without large amounts of cash and working capital 
as of april   the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 
to the ratio at april  and at april  was to we believe our current  bank line of credit together with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy the working capital needs of our business 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities increased  in the year ended april   primarily because of a large increase in net earnings and a large decrease in income taxes receivable 
this result was partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and the loss on early retirement of debt 
cash used in investing activities in the year ended april  decreased  primarily due to the decrease in the store acquisitions from the prior year 
cash used in financing activities decreased   primarily due to the decrease in the repayments of long term debt 
capital expenditures represent the single largest use of company funds 
we believe that by reinvesting in stores  we will be better able to respond to competitive challenges and increase operating efficiencies 
during fiscal  we expended  for property and equipment  primarily for construction  acquisition  and remodeling of stores compared with  in the prior year 
in fiscal  we anticipate expending between  and  primarily from existing cash and funds generated by operations  for construction  acquisition  and remodeling of stores 
as of april   we had long term debt  net of current maturities  of  consisting of  in principal amount of senior notes   in principal amount of senior notes  series a and b  and  of capital lease obligations 
interest on the senior notes is payable on the th day of each february and august 
principal on the senior notes is payable in full on august  we may prepay the notes in whole or in part at any time in an amount of not less than  at a redemption price calculated in accordance with the note agreement dated august  between the company and the purchasers of the senior notes 
interest on the senior notes series a and series b is payable on the th day of each march and september 
principal on the senior notes series a and series b is payable in various installments beginning september  we may prepay the senior notes series a and series b in whole or in part at any time in an amount of not less than  at a redemption price calculated in accordance with the note agreement dated september  between the company and the purchasers of the senior notes series a and series b 
to date  we have funded capital expenditures primarily through funds generated from operations  the proceeds of the sale of common stock  issuance of convertible subordinated debentures converted into shares of common stock in  the previously described senior notes  and a mortgage note 
future capital required to finance operations  improvements  and the anticipated growth in the number of stores is expected to come from cash generated by operations  the bank line of credit  and additional long term debt or other securities as circumstances may dictate 
we do not expect such capital needs to adversely affect liquidity 
the table below presents our significant contractual obligations  including interest  at april  contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years senior notes mortgage notes capital lease obligations operating lease obligations unrecognized tax benefits deferred compensation total unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions and since we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  the related balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 
at april   the company had a total of  in gross unrecognized tax benefits 
of this amount   represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would impact our effective tax rate 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate to the state income tax filing positions and federal tax credits claimed for the company s corporate subsidiaries 
the total amount of accrued interest and penalties for such unrecognized tax benefits was as of april  interest and penalties related to income taxes are classified as income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements 
the federal statute of limitations remains open for the years and forward 
tax years and forward are subject to audit by state tax authorities depending on open statute of limitations waivers and the tax code of each state 

table of contents a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and ultimately settled 
it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for uncertain tax positions 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months 
these changes could result from the expiration of the statute of limitations  examinations or other unforeseen circumstances 
as of april   the company has no ongoing federal income tax examination 
one state has an examination in progress 
the company did not have any outstanding litigation related to tax matters 
at this time  management believes it is reasonably possible the aggregate amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by  within the next months 
this expected decrease is due to the expiration of statute of limitations related to certain federal and state income tax filing positions 
included in long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at april   was a  obligation for deferred compensation 
as the specific payment dates for the deferred compensation are unknown due to the unknown retirement dates of many of the participants  the related balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 
however  certain payments will be due during the next years 
at april   we were partially self insured for workers compensation claims in all eleven states of our marketing territory  we also were partially self insured for general liability and auto liability under an agreement that provides for annual stop loss limits equal to or exceeding approximately  to facilitate this agreement  letters of credit approximating  and  respectively  were issued and outstanding at april  and  on the insurance company s behalf 
we renew the letters of credit on an annual basis 
forward looking statements this form k contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of as amended 
forward looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including i any statements regarding future sales and gross profit percentages  ii any statements regarding the continuation of historical trends  and iii any statements regarding the sufficiency of the company s cash balances and cash generated from operations and financing activities for the company s future liquidity and capital resource needs 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  project and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we caution you that these statements are further qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including without limitations the factors described in this form k 
we ask you not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements because they speak only of our views as of the statement dates 
although we have attempted to list the important factors that presently affect the company s business and operating results  we further caution you that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company s results of operations 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such forward looking statements  factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any forward looking statements include  among others  the following competition our business is highly competitive and marked by ease of entry and constant change in terms of the numbers and type of retailers offering the products and services found in stores 
many of the food including prepared foods and nonfood items similar or identical to those we sell are generally available from a variety of competitors in the communities served by our stores  and we compete with other convenience store chains  gasoline stations  supermarkets  drug stores  discount stores  club stores  mass merchants  and fast food outlets with respect to the sale of prepared foods 
sales of nongasoline items particularly prepared food items have contributed substantially to our gross profit on retail sales in recent years 
gasoline sales are intensely competitive 
we compete for gasoline sales with both independent and national brand gasoline stations  other convenience store chains  and several nontraditional gasoline retailers such as supermarkets in specific markets 
some of these other gasoline retailers may have access to more favorable arrangements for gasoline supply than do we or the firms that supply our stores 
some of our competitors have greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we have and therefore may be able to respond better to changes in the economy and new opportunities within the industry 

table of contents gasoline operations gasoline sales are an important part of our revenue and earnings  and retail gasoline profit margins have a substantial impact on our net income 
profit margins on gasoline sales can be affected adversely by factors beyond our control  including the supply of gasoline available in the retail gasoline market  uncertainty or volatility in the wholesale gasoline market  increases in wholesale gasoline costs generally during a period  and price competition from other gasoline marketers 
the market for crude oil and domestic wholesale petroleum products is volatile and is affected by general political conditions and instability in oil producing regions such as the middle east and south america 
the volatility of the wholesale gasoline market makes it extremely difficult to predict the impact of future wholesale cost fluctuation on our operating results and financial conditions 
these factors could materially affect gasoline gallon volume  gasoline gross profit  and overall customer traffic levels at stores 
any substantial decrease in profit margins on gasoline sales or in the number of gallons sold by stores could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
the company purchases its gasoline from a variety of independent national and regional petroleum distributors 
although in recent years suppliers have not experienced any difficulties in obtaining sufficient amounts of gasoline to meet our needs  unanticipated national and international events could result in a reduction of gasoline supplies available for distribution 
any substantial curtailment in our gasoline supply would reduce gasoline sales 
further  we believe a significant amount of our business results from the patronage of customers primarily desiring to purchase gasoline  accordingly  reduced gasoline supplies could adversely affect the sale of nongasoline items 
such factors could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and operations 
tobacco products sales of tobacco products represent a significant portion of our revenues 
significant increases in wholesale cigarette costs and tax increases on tobacco products as well as national and local campaigns to discourage smoking in the united states could have an adverse effect on the demand for cigarettes sold by stores 
we attempt to pass price increases on to our customers  but competitive pressures in specific markets may prevent us from doing so 
these factors could materially affect the retail price of cigarettes  the volume of cigarettes sold by stores  and overall customer traffic 
environmental compliance costs the united states environmental protection agency and several of the states in which we do business have adopted laws and regulations relating to underground storage tanks used for petroleum products 
in the past  we have incurred substantial costs to comply with such regulations  and additional substantial costs may be necessary in the future 
several states in which we do business have trust fund programs with provisions for sharing or reimbursing corrective action or remediation costs 
any reimbursements received in respect to such costs typically are subject to statutory provisions requiring repayment of the reimbursed funds for any future noncompliance with upgrade provisions or other applicable laws 
although we regularly accrue expenses for the estimated costs related to future corrective action or remediation efforts  there can be no assurance that the accrued amounts will be sufficient to pay such costs or that we have identified all environmental liabilities at all of our current store locations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will not incur substantial expenditures in the future for remediation of contamination or related claims that have not been discovered or asserted with respect to existing store locations or locations that we may acquire in the future  that we will not be subject to any claims for reimbursement of funds disbursed to us under the various state programs  and or that additional regulations or amendments to existing regulations will not require additional expenditures beyond those presently anticipated 
seasonality of sales company sales generally are strongest during its first two fiscal quarters may october and weakest during the third and fourth fiscal quarters november april 
in the warmer months  customers tend to purchase greater quantities of gasoline and certain convenience items such as beer  soft drinks  and ice 
difficult weather conditions such as flooding  prolonged rain  or snowstorms in any quarter  however  may adversely reduce sales at affected stores and may have an adverse impact on our earnings for that period 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
we place our investments with high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
consequently  we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we believe an immediate basis point move in interest rates affecting our floating and fixed rate financial instruments as of april  would have no material effect on pretax earnings 
in the past  we have used derivative instruments such as options and futures to hedge against the volatility of gasoline cost and were at risk for possible changes in the market value of those derivative instruments 
no such derivative instruments were used during fiscal year   or however  we do from time to time  participate in a forward buy of certain commodities  primarily cheese and coffee
