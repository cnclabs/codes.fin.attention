item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview net loss for fiscal was million or per basic and diluted share  compared to net loss for fiscal of million or per basic and diluted share and a net loss for fiscal of million or per basic and diluted share 
our operating results are described in detail in the results of operations section of this item some of the key factors that impacted our results in fiscal  and are summarized as follows sales trends our revenue growth for fiscal was compared to revenue declines of and for fiscal and  respectively 
lease termination and impairment charges we recorded lease terminations and impairment charges of million in fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
lifo charges we record the value of our inventory on the last in  first out lifo method 
we recorded non cash lifo charges of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the higher lifo charge this year is due to higher inflation on both pharmacy and front end products 
debt refinancing in fiscal  we continued to take steps to extend the terms of our debt and obtain more flexibility 
in march  we entered into a new million tranche term loan under our senior secured credit facility  the proceeds of which were used to repay and retire all borrowings under our tranche term loans 
in connection with the tranche term loan repayment and retirement we recorded a loss on debt modification of million during the first quarter of fiscal due to the write off of debt issue costs of million and unamortized original issuance discount of million 
in august  we repurchased million of our senior notes due march  million of our senior notes due december and million of our senior debentures due august these repurchases resulted in a gain in the second quarter of fiscal of million 
in february  we issued million of our senior notes due march these notes are unsecured  unsubordinated obligations of rite aid corporation and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness 
our obligations under the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  on an unsecured unsubordinated basis  by all of our subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facility and our outstanding senior secured notes due  senior secured notes due  senior secured notes due  senior secured notes due  senior secured notes due  senior notes due and senior notes due the proceeds of the notes  together with available cash  were used to repurchase and repay all of the outstanding senior notes due march in february  we completed a tender offer for the notes in which million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes were tendered and repurchased by us 
in february  we called for the redemption of the remaining notes 
we redeemed the remaining notes in march for million which included the call premium and interest through the call date 
the refinancing resulted in a loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million 
these transactions are described in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section below 

table of contents income tax net loss for fiscal included income tax benefit of million  compared to income tax expense of million for fiscal and income tax expense of million for fiscal the benefit recognized in fiscal was primarily comprised of adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of statute of limitations compared to income tax expense for fiscal and primarily for the accrual of state and local taxes and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits 
we maintain a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets 
asc  income taxes requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required 
a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
based on the negative evidence  asc precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recognition of deferred tax assets 
dilutive equity issuances on march   million shares of common stock were outstanding and an additional million shares of common stock were issuable related to outstanding stock options  convertible preferred stock and convertible notes 
on march   our million shares of potentially issuable common stock consisted of the following shares in thousands strike price outstanding stock options a b preferred stock convertible notes total and under to to to to to and over total issuable shares a the exercise of these options would provide cash of million 
b on march   we launched a stock option exchange program program for eligible associates only 
under the program  eligible associates had the opportunity to surrender certain stock options for a lesser number of new stock options with an exercise price that was determined based on the closing market price on april   the day the program concluded 
the number of new options was determined by applying exchange ratios that resulted in providing new stock options with an aggregate fair value that approximated the aggregate fair value of the options they replaced 
the new options vest over two years and have a five year life with an exercise price of 
a total of million options with an average exercise price in excess of were cancelled and million new options were granted with an exercise price of 
the company recognized a minimal incremental compensation expense as a result of the program

these increases were partially offset due to lower pharmacy reimbursement rates and by operating fewer stores than last year 
same store sales trends for fiscal and fiscal are described in the following paragraphs 
we include in same store sales all stores that have been open at least one year 
stores in liquidation are considered closed 
relocation stores are not included in same store sales until one year has lapsed 
pharmacy same store sales increased 
pharmacy same store sales were positively impacted by an increase of in same store prescriptions driven in part by our immunization program  our wellness loyalty program and inflation on brand drugs 
same store sales were also positively impacted by new customers resulting from the decrease in the number of pharmacies in the express scripts pharmacy benefit management network  partially offset by an approximate negative impact from new generic introductions and lower reimbursement rates from pharmacy benefit managers and government payors 
front end same store sales increased from the prior year reflecting the positive impact of our wellness program and other management initiatives to increase sales in the front end 
the trend improved during our fourth quarter to a same store sales increase of due to continued growth in our wellness program and strong seasonal sales 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal the decline in revenue was primarily driven by a reduction in our store base and a decline in same store sales  which decreased compared to prior year 
this decline consisted of pharmacy same store sales decrease and a decrease in front end same store sales 
additionally  revenues decreased compared to the prior year due to revenue deferrals related to our wellness loyalty program 
pharmacy same store sales decreased 
same store prescriptions decreased 
the decline in same store prescriptions was impacted by a slower start and overall softer cough  cold and flu season  coupled with an increase in day prescriptions compared to last year 
same store sales were negatively impacted by lower reimbursement rates  increased generic penetration and the prescription decline 
these trends improved during our fourth quarter as the cough  cold and flu season intensified contributing to same store pharmacy sales increased 
front end same store sales decreased from the prior year due to weakness in the overall economic environment and its impact on consumer spending behavior  partially offset by various management initiatives  such as our wellness loyalty card program 
the trend improved during our fourth quarter due largely to the later cough  cold and flu season and our wellness loyalty card program  which resulted in a front end same store sales increase of compared to the fourth quarter last year

pharmacy gross profit was higher due to increased prescription volume and the introduction of new generics including generic lipitor  partially offset by continued pressure on pharmacy benefit manager and governmental reimbursement rates 
front end gross profit was driven by higher sales reflecting the positive impact of our wellness loyalty program and continued strong rite aid brand private label penetration 
overall gross margin was for fiscal compared to in fiscal front end gross margin was lower due to a higher lifo charge partially offset by increased private label penetration 

table of contents pharmacy gross margin was lower due to a higher lifo charge and continued reimburse rate pressure partially offset by new generic introductions 
gross profit decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower same store sales and higher wellness loyalty program revenue deferrals 
gross margin was for fiscal compared to in fiscal the decline in gross margin was due primarily to deferred revenue related to our wellness customer loyalty program and a slight reduction in pharmacy gross margin  partially offset by lower product costs and new generic introductions 
there was a negative impact from the reductions in medicare reimbursements resulting from the awp rollback which was fully cycled in september the pharmacy margin pressure slowed as we continued to cycle the more significant maximum allowable costs mac of new generics which occurred last year 
front end gross margin was lower due primarily to an increase in deferred revenue related to our wellness customer loyalty program and related discounts 
partially offsetting the lower gross margin discussed above was a reduction in lifo and inventory cost capitalization charges 
we use the last in  first out lifo method of inventory valuation  which is determined annually when inflation rates and inventory levels are finalized 
therefore  lifo costs for interim period financial statements are estimated 
the lifo charge was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase in the lifo charge in fiscal is due to higher inflation on both pharmacy and front end products 
the pharmacy inflation rate in fiscal was higher than the prior year and front end inflation was over higher than the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal due mostly to expenses associated with the fifty third week in fiscal sg a as a percentage of revenue improved over fiscal due to leveraging our fixed costs relative to revenue growth 
sg a for fiscal was as a percentage of revenue  compared to in fiscal the decrease in sg a as a percentage of revenues is mostly due to a decrease in salaries and benefits resulting from continued labor control initiatives  lower occupancy and lower depreciation and amortization  and other cost containment initiatives 
these favorable variances were partially offset by an increase in bonus expense relating to improved results and higher workers compensation costs associated with unfavorable discount rate changes 
sg a for fiscal was as a percentage of revenue  compared to in fiscal the decrease in sg a as a percentage of revenues is mostly due to a decrease in salaries and benefit costs due to better labor control and reductions in store operating expenses and corporate administrative expenses resulting from our various cost reduction initiatives 
additionally  we incurred no securitization fees due to our elimination of the receivables securitization facilities on october  these cost reductions were partially offset by an increase in debit and credit card fees  and higher workers compensation and general liability costs due to a reserve reduction caused by favorable claims experience recorded in the prior year 
lease termination and impairment charges impairment charges we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset group has a carrying value that may not be recoverable 
the individual operating store is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable 
as such  we evaluate individual stores for recoverability 
to determine if a store needs to be tested for recoverability  we consider items such as decreases in market prices  changes in the manner in which the store is being used or physical condition  changes in legal factors or business climate  an accumulation of losses significantly in excess 
table of contents of budget  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection of continuing losses  or an expectation that the store will be closed or sold 
we monitor new and recently relocated stores against operational projections and other strategic factors such as regional economics  new competitive entries and other local market considerations to determine if an impairment evaluation is required 
for other stores  we perform a recoverability analysis if they have experienced current period and historical cash flow losses 
in performing the recoverability test  we compare the expected future cash flows of a store to the carrying amount of its assets 
significant judgment is used to estimate future cash flows 
major assumptions that contribute to our future cash flow projections include expected sales  gross profit  and distribution expenses  expected costs such as payroll  occupancy costs and advertising expenses  and estimates for other significant selling  and general and administrative expenses 
many long term macro economic and industry factors are considered  both quantitatively and qualitatively  in our future cash flow assumptions 
in addition to current and expected economic conditions such as inflation  interest and unemployment rates that affect customer shopping patterns  we consider that we operate in a highly competitive industry which includes the actions of other national and regional drugstore chains  independently owned drugstores  supermarkets  mass merchandisers  dollar stores and internet pharmacies 
many of our competitors are spending significant capital and promotional dollars in certain geographies to gain market share 
we have assumed certain sales growth from a new loyalty program  which although it s in its early marketing stages  is expected to not only retain but gain loyal customers 
recent and proposed pharmacy benefit management consolidation and efforts of third party public and private payers have reduced pharmacy reimbursement rates in recent years 
we expect this rate compression  which currently affects over of our pharmacy business  to continue to affect us in the foreseeable future 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and must make assumptions related to federal and state efforts and proposals to affect the pricing and regulations related to prescription drugs  as well as  expected revenues and costs related to the new patient protection and affordable care act health care reform 
additionally  we take into consideration that certain operating stores are executing specific improvement plans which are monitored quarterly to recoup recent capital investments  such as an acquisition of an independent pharmacy  which we have made to respond to specific competitive or local market conditions  or have specific programs tailored towards a specific geography or market 
we recorded impairment charges of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal our methodology for recording impairment charges has not changed materially  and has been consistently applied in the periods presented 
at march   approximately billion of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  were associated with  active operating stores 
if an operating store s estimated future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to cover its carrying value  its carrying value is reduced to fair value which is its estimated future discounted cash flows 
the discount rate is commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of a similar asset 
an impairment charge is recorded in the period that the store does not meet its original return on investment and or has an operating loss for the last two years and its projected cash flows do not exceed its current carrying cost 
the amount of the impairment charge is the entire difference between the current carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets using discounted future cash flows 
most stores are fully impaired in the period that the impairment charge is originally recorded 
we recorded impairment charges for active stores of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal 
table of contents we review key performance results for active stores on a quarterly basis and approve certain stores for closure 
impairment for closed stores  if any many stores are closed on lease expiration  are recorded in the quarter the closure decision is made and approved 
most stores are physically closed within a quarter of the closure decision 
closure decisions are made on an individual store or regional basis considering all of the macro economic  industry and other factors discussed above  in addition to  the operating store s individual operating results 
we currently have no plans to close a significant number of active stores in future periods 
in the next fiscal year  we currently expect to close stores  primarily as a result of lease expirations 
we recorded impairment charges for closed facilities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal included in the impairment charges noted above were charges of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal for existing owned surplus property 
assets to be disposed of are evaluated quarterly to determine if an additional impairment charge is required 
fair value estimates are provided by independent brokers who operate in the local markets where the assets are located 
the following table summarizes the impairment charges and number of locations  segregated by closed facilities and active stores that have been recorded in fiscal  and year ended march  february  february  number charge number charge number charge closed facilities actual and approved store closings actual and approved relocations distribution center closings existing surplus properties total impairment charges closed facilities active stores additional current period charges for stores previously impaired in prior periods charges for new and relocated stores that did not meet their asset recoverability test in the current period charges for the remaining stores that did not meet their asset recoverability test in the current period total impairment charges active stores total impairment charges all locations total number of active stores stores impaired in prior periods with no current charge stores with a current period charge total cumulative active stores with impairment charges these charges are related to stores that were impaired for the first time in prior periods 
most active stores  requiring an impairment charge  are fully impaired in the first period that they do not meet their asset recoverability test 
however  in each prior period presented  a minority of 
table of contents stores were partially impaired since their fair value supported a reduced net book value 
accordingly  these stores may be further impaired in the current and future periods as a result of changes in their actual or projected cash flows  or changes to their fair value estimates 
also  we make ongoing capital additions to certain stores to improve their operating results or to meet geographical competition  which if later are deemed to be unrecoverable  will be impaired in future periods 
of this total   and stores for fiscal years  and respectively have been fully impaired 
these charges are related to new stores open at least years and relocated stores relocated in the last years that did not meet their recoverability test during the current period 
these stores have not met our original return on investment projections and have a historical loss of at least years 
their future cash flow projections do not recover their current carrying value 
of this total   and stores for fiscal years  and respectively have been fully impaired 
these charges are related to the remaining active stores that did not meet the recoverability test during the current period 
these stores have a historical loss of at least years 
their future cash flow projections do not recover their current carrying value 
of this total   and stores for fiscal years  and respectively have been fully impaired 
the primary drivers of our impairment charges are each store s current and historical operating performance and the assumptions that we make about each store s operating performance in future periods 
projected cash flows are updated based on the next year s operating budget which includes the qualitative factors noted above 
we are unable to predict with any degree of certainty which individual stores will fall short or exceed future operating plans 
accordingly  we are unable to describe future trends that would affect our impairment charges  including the likely stores and their related asset values that may fail their recoverability test in future periods 
to the extent that actual future cash flows differ from our projections materially  because of the reasons discussed above  certain stores that are either not impaired or partially impaired in the current period may be further impaired in future periods 
a basis point decrease in our future sales assumptions as of march  would have resulted in an additional fiscal impairment charge of million 
a basis point increase in our future sales assumptions as of march  would have reduced the fiscal impairment charge by million 
changes in our discount rate of basis points would not have a material impact on the total impairment recorded in fiscal facility and equipment lease exit charges charges to close a store  which principally consist of continuing lease obligations  are recorded at the time the store is closed and all inventory is liquidated  pursuant to the guidance set forth in asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
we calculate our liability for closed stores on a store by store basis 
the calculation includes the discounted effect of future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term  net of estimated cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting properties or through favorable lease terminations 
we evaluate these assumptions each quarter and adjust the liability accordingly 
as part of our ongoing business activities  we assess stores and distribution centers for potential closure 
decisions to close stores or distribution centers in future periods would result in charges for lease exit costs and liquidation of inventory  as well as impairment of assets at these locations 
in fiscal  and  we recorded facility and equipment lease exit charges of million  million and million 
these charges related to changes in future assumptions  interest accretion and provisions for stores in fiscal  stores and one distribution center in fiscal  and stores and one distribution center in fiscal 
table of contents interest expense in fiscal   and  interest expense was million  million and million  respectively 
the reduction in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to favorable interest rates resulting from our march tranche term loan refinancing and the august refinancing of our tranche term loan partially offset by the impact of the fifty third week 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the prior year refinancing of our senior secured credit facility and the elimination of our securitization program which was previously recorded in sg a  partially offset by savings from our current year refinancing of our million senior secured credit facility term loan 
the annual weighted average interest rates on our indebtedness in fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
income taxes income tax benefit of million  income tax expense of million and income tax expense of million  has been recorded for fiscal  and  respectively 
net loss for fiscal included income tax benefit of million and was primarily comprised of adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of statute of limitations 
we maintain a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
asc  income taxes requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we take into account all available positive and negative evidence with regard to the recognition of a deferred tax asset including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect recognition of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
based on the negative evidence  asc precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recognition of deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the existence of sufficient taxable income generated in the carryforward periods 
the fiscal income tax expense of million was primarily comprised of an accrual for state and local taxes  adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits and the need for an accrual of additional state taxes resulting from the receipt of a final audit determination 
the fiscal income tax expense of million was primarily comprised of an accrual for state and local taxes net of federal tax recoveries and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits 
we monitor all available evidence related to our ability to utilize our remaining net deferred tax assets 
we maintained a full valuation allowance of  million and  million against remaining net deferred tax assets at fiscal year end and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources general we have three primary sources of liquidity i cash and cash equivalents  ii cash provided by operating activities and iii borrowings under the revolving credit facility of our senior secured credit facility 
our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital for operations  to service our obligations to pay interest and principal on debt and to fund capital expenditures 
total liquidity as of march  was million  which consisted of revolver borrowing capacity of million and invested cash of million 
we also had cash of million at year end that we had set aside to finalize the call of our remaining guaranteed unsecured notes due these notes were satisfied and discharged on march  
table of contents credit facility our senior secured credit facility consists of a billion revolving credit facility and two term loans 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum between libor plus and libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or between citibank s base rate plus and citibank s base rate plus in each case based upon the amount of revolver availability as defined in the senior secured credit facility 
we are required to pay fees between and per annum on the daily unused amount of the revolver  depending on the amount of revolver availability 
amounts drawn under the revolver become due and payable on august   provided that such maturity date shall instead be april  in the event that on or prior to april  we do not repay  refinance or otherwise extend the maturity date of our tranche term loan as defined below to a date that is at least days after august  and  in the case of a repayment or refinancing  we must have at least million of availability under the revolver 
our ability to borrow under the revolver is based upon a specified borrowing base consisting of accounts receivable  inventory and prescription files 
at march   we had million borrowings outstanding under the revolver and had letters of credit outstanding against the revolver of million  which resulted in additional borrowing capacity of million 
the credit facility also includes our billion senior secured term loan the tranche term loan 
the tranche term loan will mature on june  and currently bears interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or at citibank s base rate plus 
we must make mandatory prepayments of the tranche term loan with the proceeds of asset dispositions and casualty events subject to certain limitations  with a portion of any excess cash flow generated by us as defined in the senior secured credit facility and with the proceeds of certain issuances of equity and debt subject to certain exceptions 
if at any time there is a shortfall in our borrowing base under our senior secured credit facility  prepayment of the tranche term loan may also be required 
on march   we refinanced the tranche term loan with a million senior secured term loan the tranche term loan 
the tranche term loan matures on march   although the maturity will instead be september   in the event that we do not repay or refinance our outstanding senior notes due prior to that time 
the tranche term loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus with a libor floor 
we must make mandatory prepayments of the tranche term loan with the proceeds of asset dispositions and casualty events subject to certain limitations  with a portion of any excess cash flow generated by us as defined in the senior secured credit facility and with the proceeds of certain issuances of equity and debt subject to certain exceptions 
if at any time there is a shortfall in our borrowing base under our senior secured credit facility  prepayment of the tranche term loan may also be required 
the senior secured credit facility also restricts us and the subsidiary guarantors from accumulating cash on hand in excess of million at any time when revolving loans are outstanding not including cash located in our store deposit accounts  cash necessary to cover our current liabilities and certain other exceptions and from accumulating cash on hand with revolver borrowings in excess of million over three consecutive business days 
the senior secured credit facility also states that if at any time other than following the exercise of remedies or acceleration of any senior obligations or second priority debt and receipt of a triggering notice by the senior collateral agent from a representative of the senior obligations or the second priority debt either a an event of default exists under our senior secured credit facility or b the sum of revolver availability under our senior secured credit facility and certain amounts held on deposit with the senior collateral agent in a concentration account is less than million for three consecutive business days a cash sweep period  the funds in our deposit accounts will be swept to a concentration account with the senior collateral agent and will be applied first to repay outstanding revolving loans under the senior secured credit facility  
table of contents and then held as collateral for the senior obligations until such cash sweep period is rescinded pursuant to the terms of our senior secured credit facility 
the senior secured credit facility allows us to have outstanding  at any time  up to billion in secured second priority debt and unsecured debt in addition to borrowings under the senior secured credit facility and existing indebtedness  provided that not in excess of million of such secured second priority debt and unsecured debt shall mature or require scheduled payments of principal prior to three months after june  the senior secured credit facility allows us to incur an unlimited amount of unsecured debt with a maturity beyond three months after june   however  other outstanding indebtedness limits the amount of unsecured debt that can be incurred if certain interest coverage levels are not met at the time of incurrence of said debt 
the senior secured facility also allows  so long as the senior secured credit facility is not in default  for the repurchase of any debt with a maturity on or before june   for the voluntary repurchase of debt with a maturity after june  and the mandatory repurchase of our convertible notes due if we maintain availability on the revolving credit facility of more than million 
our senior secured credit facility contains covenants which place restrictions on the incurrence of debt beyond the restrictions described above  the payment of dividends  sale of assets  mergers and acquisitions and the granting of liens 
our credit facility has a financial covenant  which is the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the covenant requires that  if availability on the revolving credit facility is less than million  we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to 
as of march   we were in compliance with this financial covenant 
the senior secured credit facility provides for events of default including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenants and bankruptcy 
it is also an event of default if we fail to make any required payment on debt having a principal amount in excess of million or any event occurs that enables  or which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would enable  the holder of such debt to accelerate the maturity or require the repurchase of such debt 
the august amendments to the senior secured credit facility exclude the mandatory repurchase of the convertible notes due from this event of default 
the indentures that govern our secured and guaranteed unsecured notes contain restrictions on the amount of additional secured and unsecured debt that can be incurred by us 
as of march   the amount of additional secured debt that could be incurred under these indentures was approximately billion which amount does not include the ability to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions 
however  we could not incur any additional secured debt as of february  assuming a fully drawn revolver and the outstanding letters of credit 
the ability to issue additional unsecured debt under these indentures is governed by an interest coverage ratio test 
other transactions during august  we repurchased million of our senior notes due march  million of our senior notes due december and million of our senior debentures due august these repurchases resulted in a gain for the period of million

in july  we repurchased million of our million outstanding convertible notes 
the remaining convertible notes require us to maintain a listing on the nyse or certain other exchanges 
in the event of a nyse delisting  holders of these notes could require us to repurchase them  which we have the ability to do under the terms of our senior secured credit facility 
on july   we received a notice of non compliance from the nyse because the price of our common stock has fallen below the nyse s minimum share price rule

represents commitments to purchase products and licensing fees from certain vendors

the respective purchasers assume the obligations and are  therefore  primarily liable for these obligations 
obligations for income tax uncertainties pursuant to asc  income taxes of approximately million are not included in the table above as we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal cash flow was positively impacted by the reduction in net loss  an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of purchases partially offset by an increase in inventory resulting primarily from price inflation and increased store inventory to support sales growth 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal cash flow was positively impacted by a reduction in inventory and an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of purchases 
additionally  the reductions in accounts receivable were no longer offset by repayments to the receivables securitization facility which was eliminated in the third quarter of fiscal cash flow used in operating activities was million in fiscal cash flow was negatively impacted by the repayments of the accounts receivable securitization facilities totaling million and a decrease in accounts payable offset by a reduction in inventory and accounts receivable 
the decreases in accounts receivables  inventory and accounts payable were due to operating fewer stores and various working capital initiatives 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and prescription files which was partially offset by proceeds from asset dispositions and sale leaseback transactions 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and prescription files which was partially offset by proceeds from asset dispositions 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and prescription files which was offset in part by proceeds from asset dispositions 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal and was primarily due to increased revolver borrowings coupled with the february issuance of million of our senior notes due march  and concurrent repurchase of million of our senior notes due march the remaining million of the senior notes due march were repurchased in march 
table of contents cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal and was primarily due to the refinancing activity that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal  the repurchase of million of the convertible notes  other scheduled debt repayments and a small decrease in our zero balance cash accounts 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal due to proceeds from refinancings offset by a reduction in borrowings on our revolving credit facility and the payment of financing fees related to the refinancings 
capital expenditures during the fifty three week period ended march   we spent million on capital expenditures  consisting of million related to new store construction  store relocation and store remodel projects  million related to technology enhancements  improvements to distribution centers and other corporate requirements  and million related to the purchase of prescription files from independent pharmacists 
we plan on making total capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  consisting of approximately related to store relocations and remodels and new store construction  related to infrastructure and maintenance requirements and related to prescription file purchases 
management expects that these capital expenditures will be financed primarily with cash flow from operating activities 
future liquidity we are highly leveraged 
our high level of indebtedness i limits our ability to obtain additional financing  ii limits our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  iii places us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt  iv renders us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and v requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
based upon our current levels of operations  we believe that cash flow from operations together with available borrowings under the senior secured credit facility and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures at least for the next twelve months 
based on our liquidity position  which we expect to remain strong throughout the year  we do not expect the restriction on our credit facility  that could result if we fail to meet the fixed charge covenant in our senior secured credit facility  to impact our business in the next twelve months 
we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in light of our operating performance  and other relevant circumstances 
should we determine  at any time  that it is necessary to obtain additional short term liquidity  we will evaluate our alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds 
there can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding  if sought  could be obtained or if obtained  would be on terms acceptable to us 
from time to time  we may seek deleveraging transactions  including entering into transactions to exchange debt for shares of common stock  issuance of equity  repurchase outstanding indebtedness  or seek to refinance our outstanding debt or may otherwise seek transactions to reduce interest expense and extend debt maturities 
any of these transactions could impact our financial results 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory shrink  impairment of long lived assets  revenue recognition  self insurance liabilities  lease exit liabilities  income taxes and litigation 
we base 
table of contents our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
variability reflected in the sensitivity analyses presented below is based on our recent historical experience 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates and sensitivity analyses 
the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant judgments and estimates by management inventory shrink the carrying value of our inventory is reduced by a reserve for estimated shrink losses that occur between physical inventory dates 
when estimating these losses  we consider historical loss results at specific locations including stores and distribution centers  as well as overall loss trends as determined during physical inventory procedures 
the estimated shrink rate is calculated by dividing historical shrink results for stores inventoried in the most recent six months by the sales for the same period 
shrink expense is recognized by applying the estimated shrink rate to sales since the last physical inventory 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to calculate our shrink rate over the last three years 
although possible  we do not expect a significant change to our shrink rate in future periods 
a basis point difference in our estimated shrink rate for the year ended march   would have affected pre tax income by approximately million 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset group has a carrying value that may not be recoverable 
the individual operating store is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable 
as such  we evaluate individual stores for recoverability 
to determine if a store needs to be tested for recoverability  we consider items such as decreases in market prices  changes in the manner in which the store is being used or physical condition  changes in legal factors or business climate  an accumulation of losses significantly in excess of budget  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection of continuing losses  or an expectation that the store will be closed or sold 
we monitor new and recently relocated stores against operational projections and other strategic factors such as regional economics  new competitive entries and other local market considerations to determine if an impairment evaluation is required 
for other stores  we perform a recoverability analysis if they have experienced current period and historical cash flow losses 
in performing the recoverability test  we compare the expected future cash flows of a store to the carrying amount of its assets 
significant judgment is used to estimate future cash flows 
major assumptions that contribute to our future cash flow projections include expected sales and gross profit  expected costs such as payroll  occupancy costs and advertising expenses  and estimates for other significant selling  general and administrative expenses 
if an operating store s estimated future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to cover its carrying value  its carrying value is reduced to fair value which is its estimated future discounted cash flows 
the discount rate is commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of a similar asset 
we regularly approve certain stores for closure 
impairment charges for closed stores  if any  are evaluated and recorded in the quarter the closure decision is approved 
we also evaluate assets to be disposed of on a quarterly basis to determine if an additional impairment charge is required 
fair value estimates are provided by independent brokers who operate in the local markets where the assets are located 
if our actual future cash flows differ from our projections materially  certain stores that are either not impaired or partially impaired in the current period may be further impaired in future periods 
a basis point decrease in our future sales assumptions as of march  would have resulted in an additional fiscal impairment charge of million 
a basis point increase in our future sales 
table of contents assumptions as of march  would have reduced the fiscal impairment charge by million 
changes in our discount rate of basis points would not have a material impact on the total impairment recorded in fiscal revenue recognition for all sales other than third party pharmacy sales  we recognize revenue from the sale of merchandise at the time the merchandise is sold 
for third party pharmacy sales  revenue is recognized at the time the prescription is filled  which is or approximates when the customer picks up the prescription 
we record revenue net of an allowance for estimated future returns 
return activity is immaterial to revenues and results of operations in all periods presented 
on april   we launched our wellness loyalty card program chain wide 
members participating in our wellness loyalty card program earn points on a calendar year basis for eligible front end merchandise purchases and qualifying prescriptions 
one point is awarded for each dollar spent towards front end merchandise and points are awarded for each qualifying prescription 
members reach specific wellness tiers based on the points accumulated during the calendar year  which entitle them to certain future discounts and other benefits upon reaching that tier 
for example  any customer that reaches  points in a calendar year achieves the gold tier  enabling the customer to receive a discount on qualifying purchases of front end merchandise for the remaining portion of the calendar year and the next calendar year 
there are also similar silver and bronze levels with lower thresholds and benefit levels 
as wellness customers accumulate points  we defer the value of the points earned as deferred revenue based on the expected usage 
the amount deferred is based on historic and projected customer activity eg  tier level  spending level 
as customers receive discounted front end merchandise  we recognize an allocable portion of the deferred revenue 
if the achieved combined gold  silver  and bronze levels differ from the assumptions by then the revenue deferral changes by million 
if the assumed spending levels  which are the drivers of future discounts  differ by then the revenue deferral changes by million 
self insurance liabilities we expense claims for self insured workers compensation and general liability insurance coverage as incurred including an estimate for claims incurred but not paid 
the expense for self insured workers compensation and general liability claims incurred but not paid is determined using several factors  including historical claims experience and development  severity of claims  medical costs and the time needed to settle claims 
we discount the estimated expense for workers compensation to present value as the time period from incurrence of the claim to final settlement can be several years 
we base our estimates for such timing on previous settlement activity 
the discount rate is based on the current market rates for treasury bills that approximate the average time to settle the workers compensation claims 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis 
a basis point difference in the discount rate for the year ended march   would have affected pretax income by approximately million 
lease exit liabilities we record reserves for closed stores based on future lease commitments  anticipated ancillary occupancy costs and anticipated future subleases of properties 
the reserves are calculated at the individual location level and the assumptions are assessed at that level 
the reserve for lease exit liabilities is discounted using a credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
reserve estimates and related assumptions are updated on a quarterly basis 
a substantial amount of our closed stores were closed prior to our adoption of asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
therefore  if interest rates change  reserves may be increased or decreased 
in addition  changes in the real estate leasing markets can have an impact on the reserve 
as of march   a basis point variance in the credit adjusted risk free interest rate would have affected pretax income by approximately million for fiscal 
table of contents income taxes we currently have net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these nols generate significant deferred tax assets which are currently offset by a valuation allowance 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence including our historical profitability  projected taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
the weight given to the potential effect of the negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
we establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to calculate our valuation allowance over the last three years 
however  changes in market conditions and the impact of the acquisition of brooks eckerd on operations have caused changes in the valuation allowance from period to period which were included in the tax provision in the period of change 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc  income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
litigation reserves we are involved in litigation on an on going basis 
we accrue our best estimate of the probable loss related to legal claims 
such estimates are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
these estimates are updated as the facts and circumstances of the cases develop and or change 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our best estimate of the probable liability may also change 
changes to these reserves during the last three fiscal years were not material 
non gaap measures in addition to net income determined in accordance with gaap  we use certain non gaap measures  such as adjusted ebitda  in assessing our operating performance 
we believe the non gaap measures serve as an appropriate measure to be used in evaluating the performance of our business 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss excluding the impact of income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  lifo adjustments  charges or credits for facility closing and impairment  inventory write downs related to store closings  stock based compensation expense  debt modifications and retirements  sale of assets and investments  revenue deferrals related to customer loyalty programs and other items 
we reference this particular non gaap financial measure frequently in our decision making because it provides supplemental information that facilitates internal comparisons to the historical operating performance of prior periods and external comparisons to competitors historical operating performance 
in addition  incentive compensation is based on adjusted ebitda and we base certain of our forward looking estimates on adjusted ebitda to facilitate quantification of planned business activities and enhance subsequent follow up with comparisons of actual to planned adjusted ebitda 

table of contents the following is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our net loss for fiscal  and march  weeks february  weeks february  weeks net loss interest expense and securitization costs income tax benefit expense depreciation and amortization expense lifo charges lease termination and impairment charges stock based compensation expense gain on sale of assets  net loss on debt modifications and retirements  net closed facility liquidation expense severance costs customer loyalty card programs revenue deferral other adjusted ebitda in addition to adjusted ebitda  we occasionally refer to several other non gaap measures  on a less frequent basis  in order to describe certain components of our business and how we utilize them to describe our results 
these measures include but are not limited to adjusted ebitda gross margin and gross profit gross margin gross profit adjusted for non ebitda items  adjusted ebitda sg a sg a expenses adjusted for non ebitda items  fifo gross margin gross margin before lifo charges and free cash flow adjusted ebitda less cash paid for interest  rent on closed stores  capital expenditures and the change in working capital 
we include these non gaap financial measures in our earnings announcements and guidance in order to provide transparency to our investors and enable investors to better compare our operating performance with the operating performance of our competitors including with those of our competitors having different capital structures 
adjusted ebitda or other non gaap measures should not be considered in isolation from  and are not intended to represent an alternative measure of  operating results or of cash flows from operating activities  as determined in accordance with gaap 
our definition of these non gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense 
we enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of variable rate credit facilities  fixed rate long term obligations and derivative transactions 
we currently do not have any derivative transactions outstanding 

table of contents the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for each fiscal year as of march  thereafter total fair value at march  dollars in thousands long term debt  including current portion  excluding capital lease obligations fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate our ability to satisfy interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we cannot be assured that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed 
the interest rate on our variable rate borrowings  which include our revolving credit facility and our tranche term loans and tranche term loans  are all based on libor 
however  the interest rate on our tranche term loans has a libor floor of basis points 
if the market rates of interest for libor changed by basis points as of march   our annual interest expense would change by approximately million 
a change in interest rates does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed rate debt instruments 
as fixed rate debt matures  however  and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment  future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates 
this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures 
increases in interest rates would also impact our ability to refinance existing maturities on favorable terms
