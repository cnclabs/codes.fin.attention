item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview general following a recession that lasted over two years  beginning in the lodging industry started experiencing improvement in fundamentals  specifically occupancy and this improvement continued into room rates  measured by the average daily rate  or adr  which typically lags occupancy growth in the early stage of a recovery  have shown upward growth 
we believe the improvements in the economy will continue to positively impact the lodging industry and hotel operating results for  and we intend to continue to seek ways to benefit from the cyclical nature of the hotel industry 
we believe that in the current cycle  hotel values and cash flows  for the most part  peaked in  and we believe we will not achieve similar cash flows and values in the immediate future 
industry experts have suggested that cash flows within our industry may achieve these previous highs again during the period through as of december   we owned hotel properties directly  and four hotel properties through majority owned investments in joint ventures  which represents  total rooms  or  net rooms excluding those attributable to our joint venture partners 
currently  all of our hotel properties are located in the united states

also in march  with an investment of million  we converted our interest in a joint venture that held a mezzanine loan into a common equity interest and a million preferred equity interest in a new joint venture the pim highland jv that holds high quality full and select service hotel properties with  total rooms  or  net rooms excluding those attributable to our joint venture partner 
at december   we also wholly owned one mezzanine loan of million and one note receivable of million in connection with a joint venture restructuring 
based on our primary business objectives and forecasted operating conditions  our current key priorities and financial strategies include  among other things acquisition of hotel properties  disposition of hotel properties  investing in securities  pursuing capital market activities to enhance long term shareholder value  repurchasing capital stock subject to regulatory limitations and our board of directors authorization  preserving capital  enhancing liquidity  and continuing current cost saving measures  implementing selective capital improvements designed to increase profitability  implementing effective asset management strategies to minimize operating costs and increase revenues  financing or refinancing hotels on competitive terms  utilizing hedges and derivatives to mitigate risks  and making other investments or divestitures that our board of directors deems appropriate 
our investment strategies continue to focus on the upscale and upper upscale segments within the lodging industry 
we believe that as supply  demand  and capital market cycles change  we will be able to shift our 
table of contents investment strategies to take advantage of new lodging related investment opportunities as they may develop 
our board of directors may change our investment strategies at any time without shareholder approval or notice

the credit risk underlying the credit default swaps are referenced to the cmbx index

the cmbx is traded via pay as you go credit default swaps  which involve ongoing  two way payments over the life of the contract between the buyer and the seller of protection 
the reference obligations are cmbs bonds 
the seller of protection assumes the credit risk of the reference obligation from the buyer of protection in exchange for payments of an annual premium 
if there is a default or a loss  as defined in the credit default swap agreements  on the underlying bonds  then the buyer of protection is protected against those losses 
the only liability for ashford  the buyer of protection  is the annual premium and any change in value of the underlying cmbx index if the trade is terminated prior to maturity 
for the cmbx trades that we have completed  we were the buyer of 
table of contents protection in all trades 
assuming the underlying bonds pay off at par over their remaining average life  our total exposure for these trades is approximately million 
the fair value of the credit default swaps is obtained from a third party who publishes various information including the index composition and price data

net cash flows provided by operating activities  pursuant to our consolidated statement of cash flows  which includes the changes in balance sheet items  were million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to the net investment of million in trading securities  the timing of collecting receivables from hotel guests  paying vendors and settling with hotel managers and an increase in restricted cash due to additional cash deposits for certain debt services and capital expenditures 
the decrease was partially offset by a net litigation settlement payment of million

we are required to maintain certain financial ratios under various debt and derivative agreements 
if we violate covenants in any debt or derivative agreement  we could be required to repay all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be unable to arrange financing for such repayment on attractive terms  if at all 
violations of certain debt covenants may result in us being unable to borrow unused amounts under a line of credit  even if repayment of some or all borrowings is not required 
in any event  financial covenants under our current or future debt obligations could impair our planned business strategies by limiting our ability to borrow i beyond certain amounts or ii for certain purposes 
presently  our existing financial debt covenants primarily relate to maintaining minimum debt coverage ratios  maintaining an overall minimum net worth  maintaining a maximum loan to value ratio  and maintaining an overall minimum total assets 
as of december   we were in compliance in all material respects with all covenants or other requirements set forth in our debt and related agreements as amended 
the mortgage and mezzanine loans securing the highland portfolio are nonrecourse to the borrowers  except for customary exceptions  or carve outs  that trigger recourse liability to the borrowers in certain limited instances 
the recourse obligations typically include only the payment of costs and liabilities suffered by the lenders as a result of the occurrence of certain bad acts on the part of the borrower  however  in certain cases  the carve outs could trigger recourse obligations on the part of the borrower with respect to repayment of all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the loans 
we have entered into customary guaranty agreements pursuant to which we guaranty payment of any recourse liabilities of the borrowers that result from the non recourse carve outs which include  but are not limited to  fraud  misrepresentation  willful conduct resulting 
table of contents in waste  misappropriations of rents following an event of default  voluntary bankruptcy filings  unpermitted transfers of collateral and certain environmental liabilities 
in the opinion of management  none of these guaranty agreements  either individually or in the aggregate  are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
virtually  our only recourse obligation is our million senior credit facility held by four banks  which expires in september currently  there is no outstanding balance on this credit facility 
the main covenants in this senior credit facility include i the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  of x through expiration ours was x at december   and ii the maximum leverage ratio  as defined  of ours was at december  
in the event we borrow on this credit facility  we may be unable to refinance a portion or all of this senior credit facility before maturity  and if it becomes necessary to pay down the principal balance  if any  at maturity  we believe we will be able to accomplish that with cash on hand  cash flows from operations  equity raises or  to the extent necessary  asset sales 
based upon the current level of operations  management believes that our cash flow from operations along with our cash balances and the amount available under our senior credit facility million at december  will be adequate to meet upcoming anticipated requirements for interest and principal payments on debt  working capital  and capital expenditures for the next months 
with respect to upcoming maturities  we will continue to proactively address our upcoming and maturities 
no assurances can be given that we will obtain additional financings or  if we do  what the amount and terms will be 
our failure to obtain future financing under favorable terms could adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy 
in addition  we may selectively pursue debt financing on individual properties 
we are committed to an investment strategy where we will opportunistically pursue hotel related investments as suitable situations arise 
funds for future hotel related investments are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from cash on hand  future borrowings under the credit facility or other loans  or from proceeds from additional issuances of common stock  preferred stock  or other securities  asset sales  and joint ventures 
however  we have no formal commitment or understanding to invest in additional assets  and there can be no assurance that we will successfully make additional investments 
we may  when conditions are suitable  look at additional capital raising opportunities 
our existing hotels are mostly located in developed areas that contain competing hotel properties 
the future occupancy  adr  and revpar of any individual hotel could be materially and adversely affected by an increase in the number or quality of the competitive hotel properties in its market area 
competition could also affect the quality and quantity of future investment opportunities 
dividend policy 
in february  the board of directors accepted management s recommendation to resume paying cash dividends on our outstanding shares of common stock with an annualized target of per share for for the year ended december   we have declared dividends of per share 
in december  the board of directors approved our dividend policy for and we expect to pay a quarterly dividend of per share for the adoption of a dividend policy does not commit our board of directors to declare future dividends or the amount thereof 
the board of directors will continue to review its dividend policy on a quarterly basis 
we may incur indebtedness to meet distribution requirements imposed on reits under the internal revenue code to the extent that working capital and cash flow from our investments are insufficient to fund required distributions 
or  we may elect to pay dividends on our common stock in cash or a combination of cash and shares of securities as permitted under federal income tax laws governing reit distribution requirements 
we may pay dividends in excess of our cash flow

revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate adr charged and the average daily occupancy achieved 
revpar does not include revenues from food and beverage or parking  telephone  or other guest services generated by the property 
although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues  it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels 
we also use revpar to compare the results of our hotels between periods and to analyze results of our comparable hotels comparable hotels represent hotels we have owned for the entire year 
revpar improvements attributable to increases in occupancy are generally accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs 
revpar improvements attributable to increases in adr are generally accompanied by increases in limited categories of operating costs  such as management fees and franchise fees

room revenues from comparable hotels increased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  
the increase in room revenue was primarily due to the continued improvements in occupancy coupled with the increase in average daily rate 
during  we experienced a basis points increase in occupancy and a increase in room rates as the economy continues to improve 
food and beverage revenues from comparable hotels experienced a similar increase of million  or  due to improved occupancy 
other revenue from comparable hotels experienced a decrease of  rental income of million was recognized through december  for a hotel property that was leased to a third party under a triple net basis 
effective december   we were assigned the remaining ownership interest in the joint venture which previously held a hotel property under a triple net lease 
the lease agreement was canceled and the operating results of this hotel property have been included in our consolidated statements of operations  which accounted for a total of million of room  food and beverage  and other hotel revenues 
the remaining increase in total hotel revenue of million is attributable to the acquisition of the worldquest condominium properties in march no interest income from notes receivable has been recorded for as the remaining two mezzanine loans in our loan portfolio as of december  were impaired in the previous two years 
interest income on notes receivable was million for we recorded a credit to impairment charges of million and million for and  respectively 
in april  we entered into a settlement agreement with the borrower of the mezzanine loan which was secured by a hotel property portfolio and scheduled to mature in april the borrower repaid the loan for million 
the mezzanine loan had a carrying value of million at march  and december   after an impairment charge of million was recorded at december  the difference of million between the settlement amount and the carrying value was recorded as a credit to impairment charges in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
during  impairment charges included a credit of million on the cash settlement of a mezzanine loan that was previously impaired 
asset management fees and other was  for and  for hotel operating expenses 
hotel operating expenses consist of direct expenses from departments associated with revenue streams and indirect expenses associated with support departments and management fees 
we experienced increases of million in direct expenses and million in indirect expenses and management fees in the increase in direct and indirect expenses from comparable hotels was million and million  respectively 
the increase in these expenses is primarily attributable to higher occupancy and higher management fees resulting from increased hotel revenues  and higher sales and marketing expenses 
the 
table of contents worldquest condominium properties incurred million in total hotel operating expenses and the consolidation of the previous triple net lease hotel property contributed  increase in total hotel operating expenses during the direct expenses were of total hotel revenue for and for property taxes  insurance and other 
property taxes  insurance and other decreased million for to million 
the decrease in comparable hotels is primarily due to a million reduction in property taxes resulting from our continued successful appeals as we secured significant reductions in the assessed value related to certain of our hotel properties 
the decrease in these expenses also reflects a decline of  of other taxes  a gain of  recognized on an insurance claim and other activities in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million for compared to primarily due to increase in depreciation expense for capital improvements made at certain hotel properties 
the increase was partially offset by decrease in depreciation for certain assets that had been fully depreciated during impairment charges 
we recorded a credit to impairment charges of million in  for cash received and valuation adjustments on the previously impaired mezzanine loans 
the impairment charges for our continuing operations were million for we recorded million of impairment charges on mezzanine loans  million impairment on a hotel property  and a credit of million related to the valuation adjustments on previously impaired loans in our mezzanine loan portfolio 
of the total impairment charges of million for  million was the valuation allowance recorded for the extended stay hotels mezzanine loan and million for four other mezzanine notes 
the impairment charge recorded on hotel properties for and of million and million  respectively  are included in the operating results of discontinued operations 
in evaluating possible loan impairment  we analyze our notes receivable individually and collectively for possible loan losses in accordance with the applicable authoritative accounting guidance 
based on the analysis  if we conclude that no loans are individually impaired  we then further analyze the specific characteristics of the loans  based on other authoritative guidance to determine if there would be probable losses in a group of loans with similar characteristics 
the loans we have had in our portfolio were collateralized by hotel properties 
some loans were collateralized by single hotel properties and others by hotel portfolios 
the hotel properties were in different geographic locations  had different ages and a few of the properties had completed significant renovations which had a significant impact on the value of the underlying collateral 
the hotel properties included independent and nationally recognized brands in all segments and classes including luxury  economy  extended stay  full service  and select service 
in addition  our loan assets varied by position in the related borrower s capital structure  ranging from junior mortgage participations to mezzanine loans 
the terms of our notes or participations were structured based on the different features of the related collateral and the priority in the borrower s capital structure 
the authoritative accounting guidance requires that an individual loan not impaired individually be included in the assessment of the loss in a group of loans only if specific characteristics of the loan indicate that it is probable that there would be an incurred loss in a group of loans with similar characteristics 
as loans in our portfolio have significantly different risk factors and characteristics  such as different maturity terms  different types and classes of collateral  different interest rate structures  and different priority status  we concluded that the characteristics of the loans within the portfolio were not sufficiently similar as to allow an evaluation of these loans as a group for possible impairment within the authoritative accounting guidance 
investments in hotel properties are reviewed for impairment for each reporting period 
we take into account the latest operating cash flows and market conditions and their impact on future projections 
for the properties 
table of contents that showed indicators of impairment  we perform a recoverability analysis using the sum of each property s estimated future undiscounted cash flows compared to the property s carrying value 
the estimates of future cash flows are based on assumptions about the future operating results including disposition of the property 
in addition  the cash flow estimation periods used are based on the properties remaining useful lives to us expected holding periods 
for properties securing mortgage loans  the assumptions regarding holding periods considered our ability and intent to hold the property to or beyond the maturity of the related indebtedness 
in analyzing projected hotel properties operating cash flows  we factored in revpar growth based on data from third party sources 
in addition  the projected hotel properties operating cash flows factored in our ongoing implementation of asset management strategies to minimize operating costs 
after factoring in the expected revenue growth and the impact of company specific strategies implemented to minimize operating costs  the hotel properties estimated future undiscounted cash flows were in excess of the properties carrying values 
with the exception of the three hilton hotel properties  the analyses performed in did not identify any other properties with respect to which an impairment loss should be recognized 
for a full description of impairment charges  see notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements and the executive overview

the increase in other corporate general and administrative expenses during is primarily attributable to an increase in employee compensation and target incentives for certain executives
