item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial operations overview net sales systems business  for a listing of these projects 
in europe  we are engaged in project development activities with respect to certain projects in germany and italy and we are actively evaluating additional project opportunities in matured european markets and emerging eastern europe 
in asia including india  china and southeast asia and the middle east and north africa mena  we have been actively pursuing opportunities to offer our utility scale pv systems solutions 
we expect our focus on  and investment in  these markets to increase as we execute our long term strategic plan 
customers with respect to our systems business  our customers consist of investor owned utilities  independent power developers and producers  commercial and industrial companies  and other system owners who purchase from us completed solar power plants  epc services  and o m services when required 
during  the substantial majority of our systems business sales were generated in north america 
during  the principal customer of our systems business was nrg energy 
during  this customer individually accounted for the majority of our systems segment s net sales 
each of our other customers individually accounted for less than of our system segment s net sales during competition with respect to our systems business  we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions  including developers of pv  solar thermal and concentrated solar power systems  and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects  including wind  hydropower  geothermal  biomass  and tidal projects 
to the extent other solar module manufacturers become more vertically integrated  we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well 
we also face competition from other epc companies and joint ventures between epc companies and solar companies 
epc warranty in addition to our solar module warranty described above  for solar power plants built by our systems business  we typically provide a limited warranty against defects in workmanship  engineering design  and installation services under normal use and service conditions for a period of one to two years following the energizing of a section of a solar power plant or upon substantial completion of the entire solar power plant 
in resolving claims under the workmanship  design and installation warranties  we have the option of either remedying the defect to the warranted level through repair  refurbishment  or replacement 
as of december   our systems business accrued warranty liability was million  of which million was classified as current and million was classified as noncurrent 
as of december   our systems business accrued warranty liability was million  all of which was classified as current 
support programs support programs for pv solar electricity generation  depending on the jurisdiction  include feed in tariffs fits  quotas including renewable portfolio standards and tendering systems  and net metering programs 
in addition to these  financial incentives for renewables include tax incentives  grants  loans  rebates  and production incentives 
although we expect to become less impacted by  and less dependent on  support programs as we execute on our long term strategic plan and transition into sustainable markets  support programs will continue to play varying roles in accelerating adoption of our pv solar systems around the world 
under a basic fit program  producers of renewable energy are paid a set rate for their electricity  usually differentiated according to the technology used and size of the installation 
for pv solar  the rate has historically been set above market rates and is fixed for a period of up to years 
in most countries with fits  grid operators are obliged to provide priority and guaranteed access to the grid for renewable energy installations 
the additional costs of these schemes are generally passed through to the electricity consumers by way of a premium on the kilowatt hour kwh end user price 
these fit subsidies have been critical for the development of the solar industry because they provided the demand visibility required for module manufacturers and other participants in the solar value chain to reduce costs and drive scale 
prior to  the majority of our module sales had been for grid connected ground or commercial roof mounted solar power systems in germany and other european union countries with fit subsidies 
whereas fit laws set the price and let the market determine capacity and generation  quota systems work in reverse 
in general  governments mandate a minimum share of capacity or grid connected generation of electricity to come from renewable energy sources 
this share often increases over time  with a specific final target and end date 
the mandate can be placed on producers  distributors  or consumers 
there are two main types of quota systems used obligation certificate and tendering systems 
a renewable portfolio standard rps is in the former category 
under an rps  regulated utilities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total electricity sales to end user customers from eligible renewable resources  such as solar generating facilities  by a specified date 
some programs further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generating facilities 
the majority of states in the us have enacted legislation adopting rps mechanisms 
rps legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state  particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state s rps mandate  the definition of eligible renewable energy resources  and the extent to which renewable energy credits paper certificates representing the generation of renewable energy qualify for rps compliance 
currently  there is no federal rps mandate or clean energy standard  although the obama administration has called upon the united states congress to create one 
measured in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its rps mandate  california s rps program is the most significant in the us  and the california market for renewable energy dominates the western us region 
first enacted in  california s rps statute has been amended several times to increase the overall percentage requirement as well as to accelerate the target date for program compliance 
pursuant to amendments enacted by the california legislature in april  the california rps program now requires obligated load serving entities to procure of their retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by in contrast to an rps system  tendering systems of procurement such as those used in south africa and india are focused on specific targets for new capacity 
in south africa  for example  the government is procuring bids under a competitive tender with solicitation dates spread over about two years 
the request for proposal rfp is the first major solicitation in support of a target of over gw of renewable energy in south africa s integrated resource plan 
project proponents bid competitively at each solicitation date until all the capacity has been allocated 
the tender solicitation approach allows governments or utilities to proscribe project construction time frames to achieve specific generation targets for the electricity system 
net energy metering programs enable end users to install renewable systems and to offset their retail energy consumption with production from on site facilities and  in some cases  to sell excess solar electricity to their retail electricity provider 
because the bundled cost of retail electricity usually exceeds the cost of unbundled electricity  net metering programs provide an incentive to the end user  based on the savings for the electricity system 
the policies governing net energy metering vary by state and utility 
some utilities pay the end user in advance  while others credit the end user s bill 
tax incentive programs exist in the united states at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits  accelerated depreciation and sales and property tax exemptions 
at the federal level  investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the s 
in october  the united states congress extended the federal investment tax credit itc for both residential and commercial solar installations for eight years  through december  the itc is a primary economic driver of solar installations in the united states 
its extension through has contributed to greater medium term demand visibility in the us  however  its expiration at the end of unless extended underscores the need for the levelized cost of electricity from solar systems to continue to decline toward grid parity 
two federal programs related to renewable energy ended in i the department of energy section loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects  renewable energy manufacturing facilities and electric power transmission projects and ii the department of the treasury section cash grant program  which provided cash grants equal to of the cost of the system for solar installations that were placed into service during  and and for certain solar installations for which construction began prior to december  this cash grant was available in lieu of receiving the federal investment tax credit 
the intent of this program was to ensure that investors who had historically supported the renewable energy programs would not be constrained from investing in these transactions by tax losses they may have suffered during the recent credit crisis 
in europe  renewable energy targets  in conjunction with fits  have contributed to the growth in pv solar markets 
renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources  while fit policies are intended to support new supply development by providing investor certainty 
a european union eu directive for promoting renewable energy use in electricity generation directive ec set varying national indicative targets for renewable energy production from individual member states 
a eu directive on renewable energy directive ec  which replaced the directive  sets varying targets for all eu member states in support of the directive s goal of a share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by  and requires national action plans that establish clear pathways for the development of renewable energy sources 
the following is a description of fit policies adopted in certain critical markets in support of renewable energy targets 
germany  which accounted for approximately of our net sales  will account for a declining percentage of our net sales over the next three years due to changing levels of policy support and demand 
the german government continues to evaluate changes to the german renewable energy law  or the eeg  and recently proposed significant and accelerated fit reductions for projects up to mw and an elimination of fits for projects over mw 
these proposed fit changes  if adopted  would particularly impact the competitiveness in germany of our core offering of large scale free field pv systems and modules to be installed in such systems 
if these policy changes proposed by the german environment and economy ministers are approved without change by the german parliament  they will negatively affect long term demand and price levels for our pv products in germany  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
in france  which accounted for approximately of our net sales  the government adopted a decree introducing a new market support framework in the first quarter of the new framework foresees a tender process for large rooftop and free field systems and is expected to have a negative effect on the total volumes of pv deployed in france in as previously announced  we have postponed the construction of our previously announced line plant in france until global supply and demand dynamics support the additional manufacturing capacity 
in ontario  canada  a fit program was introduced in september and replaced the renewable energy standard offer program resop as the primary subsidy program for renewable energy projects 
in order to participate in the ontario fit program  certain provisions relating to minimum required domestic content and agricultural land use restrictions for solar installations must be satisfied 
the domestic content and land restriction rules do not apply to our solar projects governed by resop contracts 
however  pv solar power systems incorporating our modules do not presently satisfy the domestic content requirement under the fit program currently in effect 
trade challenges have been initiated at the world trade organization wto to contest the ontario fit s domestic content requirements 
it is possible that such requirements could be removed from the program in response to a wto decision 
in australia  which accounted for less than of our net sales  the solar industry is driven by several regulatory initiatives that support the installation of solar pv modules in both rooftop and free field applications  including the federal government s nationwide renewable energy target which has set a renewable energy goal for australia of by australia s recently legislated clean energy future package results in a carbon pricing mechanism commencing on july   with a fixed carbon price that will transition to a flexible price cap and trade scheme on july  this will support the creation of the aud billion clean energy finance corporation cefc  a commercially orientated fund established to drive the deployment of non wind renewable energy 
in addition  the australian government has legislated the establishment of a new independent statutory body  the australian renewable energy agency arena  to manage over aud billion in renewable energy investments 
in india  which accounted for nearly of our net sales  the national solar mission includes a goal of installing gw of solar power generation capability by india also announced a fit policy for the first phase of the national solar mission in in addition  some states including gujarat  rajasthan  and karnataka have developed or are developing state level solar procurement programs 
mws of ppas were signed under the national solar mission phase batch and mws of ppas were signed under gujarat state s program 
an estimated mws of these ppas were installed in in china  governmental authorities recently adopted a national fit policy for large scale projects 
china also expanded the golden sun program  an upfront cost subsidy program  aimed primarily at distributed generation 
in addition  according to the current draft of the th year plan for solar energy  the government intends to raise the goal for total cumulative solar energy capacity to gw and gw by in  we executed two small demonstration projects with key chinese generating companies to test module performance in china 
in  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the ordos  china city government relating to the construction of a utility scale pv power plant located within the ordos new energy industry demonstration zone in china  and are in the process of completing a feasibility study for the first mw phase 
in the middle east and north africa mena  several countries have announced sizeable solar targets  although policy mechanisms are not yet firmly established 
in the kingdom of saudi arabia  a solar policy with targets and incentives is expected in the size of the program is expected to be tens of gigawatts of solar by  or as early as in the united arab emirates  abu dhabi has set a target of sourcing of electricity supply from renewables by and in issued a tender for the first of three mw pv projects 
in january  dubai announced plans for a gw solar farm by in morocco  the government has set a gw solar goal by other markets such as algeria  egypt  jordan  kuwait  oman  qatar  and tunisia are also actively promoting solar and issuing tenders 
while the potential of the above referenced mena markets are significant  policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia  political instability  geopolitical risk  fossil fuel subsidization  and or potentially stringent localization requirements 
for more information about risks related to economic incentives  please see item a risk factors reduced growth in or the reduction  elimination  or expiration of government subsidies  economic incentives  and other support for on grid solar electricity applications  including potential mid year fit reductions or other program changes in germany and certain other core markets  could reduce demand and or price levels for our solar modules  and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales  and adversely impact our operating results 
intellectual property our success depends  in part  on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
we rely primarily on a combination of patents  trademarks and trade secrets  as well as associate and third party confidentiality agreements  to safeguard our intellectual property 
we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development  and are currently pursuing patent applications in the us and worldwide 
our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek  or at all  and any patents we may receive may be challenged  invalidated  or declared unenforceable 
in addition  we have registered and or have applied to register  trademarks and service marks in the us and a number of foreign countries for first solar and first solar and design 
with respect to proprietary know how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce  we rely on  among other things  trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests 
we believe that many elements of our pv manufacturing process  including our unique materials sourcing  involve proprietary know how  technology  or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications  including technical processes  equipment designs  algorithms  and procedures 
we have taken security measures to protect these elements 
all of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us 
these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions  designs  and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us

item a risk factors an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the following information  together with the other information in this annual report on form k  before buying shares of our stock 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 
risks related to our markets and customers an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations solar manufacturers have installed production capacity that significantly exceeded global demand in we believe this structural imbalance between supply and demand ie  where production capacity significantly exceeds current global demand will continue for the foreseeable future  and we expect that it will continue to put pressure on pricing 
in light of the increase in global production capacity  we recently decided not to proceed any further with the development of our previously announced line plant in vietnam  and have also postponed the commissioning of our previously announced line plant in mesa  arizona and the construction of our previously announced line plant in france until such time as global supply and demand dynamics support the additional manufacturing capacity 
there can be no assurance that we will not be required to take further actions to address global production supply and demand in those geographic areas 
additionally  in  industry average sales prices per watt asps declined significantly  as competitors reduced asps to sell through inventories in europe and elsewhere 
if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs  or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time  or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if pv technology is not suitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return  or if sufficient additional demand for solar modules does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate  our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 
the solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development  in comparison to fossil fuel based electricity generation 
if pv technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if additional demand for solar modules fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate  we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability 
in addition  demand for solar modules in our targeted markets  including north america  europe  india  china  the middle east  australia and other foreign jurisdictions  may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate 
many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of pv technology and demand for solar systems and modules  including the following cost effectiveness of the electricity generated by pv power systems compared to conventional energy sources  such as natural gas and coal  and other non solar renewable energy sources  such as wind  performance  reliability and availability of energy generated by pv systems compared to conventional and other non solar renewable energy sources and products  success of other renewable energy generation technologies  such as hydroelectric  tidal  wind  geothermal  solar thermal  concentrated pv  and biomass  fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the price of  and demand for  conventional and non solar renewable energy sources  such as increases or decreases in the price of natural gas  coal  oil  and other fossil fuels  fluctuations in capital expenditures by end users of solar modules  which tend to decrease when the economy slows and when interest rates increase  and availability  substance  and magnitude of government targets  subsidies  incentives  and renewable portfolio standards to accelerate the development of the solar energy industry 
reduced growth in or the reduction  elimination  or expiration of government subsidies  economic incentives  and other support for on grid solar electricity applications  including recently announced mid year feed in tariff reductions or other program changes in germany and certain other core markets  could reduce demand and or price levels for our solar modules  and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales  and adversely impact our operating results 
although our long term strategic plan provides for first solar to transition over time toward operating in sustainable markets  in the near term our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives 
federal  state  and local governmental bodies in many countries have provided subsidies in the form of fit  rebates  tax incentives  and other incentives to end users  distributors  systems integrators  and manufacturers of pv products 
many of these jurisdictions  including the majority of us states and numerous european union countries  have adopted renewable portfolio standards in which the government requires jurisdictions or regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity from specified sources of renewable energy  such as solar  wind  and hydroelectric power 
many of these government incentives expire  phase out over time  require renewal by the applicable authority  or may be amended 
a summary of recent developments in the major government subsidy programs that can impact our business appears under item business support programs 
to the extent these government incentives are reduced earlier than previously expected  or free field or conversion land applications are disadvantaged  such changes could reduce demand and or price levels for our solar modules  lead to a reduction in our net sales  and adversely impact our operating results 
germany  which accounted for approximately of our net sales  will account for a declining percentage of our net sales over the next three years due to changing levels of policy support and demand 
the german government continues to evaluate changes to the german renewable energy law  or the eeg  and recently proposed significant and accelerated fit reductions for projects up to mw and an elimination of fits for projects over mw 
these proposed fit changes  if adopted  would particularly impact the competitiveness in germany of our core offering of large scale free field pv systems and modules to be installed in such systems 
if these policy changes proposed by the german environment and economy ministers are approved without change by the german parliament  they will negatively affect long term demand and price levels for our pv products in germany  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
in france  the government introduced a new market support framework during the first quarter of the level of this new market support framework is inadequate for us to pursue an expansion strategy in france 
as a result  we have postponed the construction of our previously announced line plant in france until global supply and demand dynamics support the additional manufacturing capacity 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra and the tax act provide for certain measures intended to benefit on grid solar electricity generation and other renewable energy initiatives 
the expiration of the department of treasury s section cash grant program on december   may adversely affect our ability to arrange financing for utility scale projects by forcing reliance on less abundant tax equity financing and may otherwise adversely affect the attractiveness of the us solar market 
the expiration of the department of energy section loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects  renewable energy manufacturing facilities and electric power transmission projects may adversely affect our ability to arrange financing in the future for utility scale projects by increasing our cost of capital  and may also otherwise affect the attractiveness of the us solar market 
in ontario  canada  a fit program was introduced in september and replaced the renewable energy standard offer program resop as the primary subsidy program for renewable energy projects 
in order to participate in the ontario fit program  certain provisions relating to minimum required domestic content and agricultural land use restrictions for solar installations must be satisfied 
the domestic content and land restriction rules do not apply to our solar projects governed by resop contracts 
however  pv solar power systems incorporating our modules do not presently satisfy the domestic content requirement under the fit program currently in effect  and thus projects incorporating our modules would not qualify for the ontario fit 
in the event the ontario domestic content requirement rules are not eliminated  we will not be able to participate in the ontario fit program  and thus our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in ontario  canada beyond our remaining resop projects would be adversely affected 
in australia  the solar industry is driven by several regulatory initiatives that support the installation of solar pv modules in both rooftop and free field applications  including the federal government s nationwide renewable energy target  which has set a renewable energy goal for australia of by the creation of the clean energy finance corporation cefc and the establishment of the australian renewable energy agency arena also occurred in and will begin implementation in if such programs or other initiatives are not successfully executed in addressing australia s renewable energy goals  the size and attractiveness of australia s solar market may be limited and we may be unable to sell modules or systems in australia at an attractive price  limiting one of our anticipated growth markets 
in india  the national solar mission includes a goal of installing gw of solar by there is no guarantee that india will maintain this goal or adopt the required policies to meet that goal  without which  the size and attractiveness of india s solar market may be limited and we may be unable to sell modules or systems in india at an attractive price  limiting one of our anticipated growth markets 
in china  governmental authorities recently adopted a national fit but the specific terms and future of the program are unclear 
it is currently assumed that the term is years and the fit will be in place in but not clear if there will be a digression beyond that 
the fit is economically viable given local generation company low return requirements but project costs are depressed given high competition in component manufacturing ie over local module manufacturers are selling into the market 
participation in the golden sun program for distributed generation also includes an implicit requirement for local manufacturing 
in the middle east and north africa mena  several countries have announced sizeable solar targets  although policy mechanisms are not yet firmly established 
policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia  political instability  geopolitical risk  fossil fuel subsidization  and potentially stringent localization requirements 
this vulnerability may adversely affect our ability to expand in or enter into such markets  or may otherwise affect the attractiveness of such solar markets 
reduced growth in or the reduction  elimination  or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for on grid solar energy applications  could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we could be adversely affected by any violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and foreign anti bribery laws 
the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
other countries in which we operate also have anti bribery laws  some of which prohibit improper payments to government and non government persons and entities 
our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws 
we currently operate in  and pursuant to our long term strategic plan intend to further expand into  many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and  in certain circumstances  strict compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 
in addition  due to the level of regulation in our industry  our entry into new jurisdictions  including india  china  and the middle east  requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from us standards 
although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these anti bribery laws  our employees  subcontractors and agents may take actions in violation of our policies and anti bribery laws 
any such violation  even if prohibited by our policies  could subject us to criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and reputation 
we may be unable to fully execute on our long term strategic plan  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we face numerous difficulties in executing our long term strategic plan  particularly in new foreign jurisdictions  including each of the risks described in the risk factors entitled our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks  including unfavorable political  regulatory  labor  and tax conditions in foreign countries 
and reduced growth in or the reduction  elimination  or expiration of government subsidies  economic incentives  and other support for on grid solar electricity applications  including recently announced mid year feed in tariff reductions or other program changes in germany and certain other core markets  could reduce demand and or price levels for our solar modules  and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales  and adversely impact our operating results  as well as the following difficulty in accurately prioritizing geographic markets which we can most effectively and profitably serve with our utility scale pv offerings  including miscalculations in overestimating or underestimating our addressable market demand  difficulty in overcoming the inertia involved in changing local electricity ecosystems as necessary to accommodate large scale pv solar deployment and integration  protectionist or other adverse public policies in countries we operate in and or are pursuing  including local content requirements or capital investment requirements  difficulty in timely identifying  attracting and retaining qualified sales  technical and other personnel in geographies targeted for expansion  the possibility of having insufficient capital resources necessary to acheive an effective localized business presence in targeted jurisdictions  difficulty in competing against competitors who may have greater financial resources and or a more effective or established localized business presence  difficulty in competing against competitors who may gain in profitability and financial strength over time by successfully participating in the global rooftop pv solar market  which is a segment we intend to de emphasize as part of our long term strategic plan  difficulty in developing any necessary partnerships with local businesses  on commercially acceptable terms  and difficulty in balancing market demand and manufacturing production in an efficient and timely manner  potentially causing us to be manufacturing capacity constrained in some future periods or over supplied in others 
an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for end users to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar systems or modules and or lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules 
many of our customers and our systems business depend on debt and or equity financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop  build and purchase a pv system 
as a result  an increase in interest rates or lending rates  or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments  could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or our systems business to secure the financing necessary to develop  build  purchase or install a pv system on favorable terms  or at all  and thus lower demand for our solar modules which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales 
in addition  we believe that a significant percentage of our end users install pv systems as an investment  funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt 
an increase in interest rates and or lending rates could lower an investor s return on investment in a pv system  increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv systems  and  in each case  could cause these end users to seek alternative investments 
as described above under item business support programs  the grant in lieu of the federal investment tax credit under the arra expired december  and unless extended  will not be available for solar installations that begin construction on or after january  if such program is not extended  total tax equity availability could be reduced which may adversely affect our ability to arrange financing for utility scale projects and may adversely affect the attractiveness of the us solar market 
we currently depend on a limited number of customers within our components business 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in orders from  any of these customers could significantly reduce our net sales and negatively impact our operating results 
within our components business  we continue to sell a sizeable portion of our solar modules to customers headquartered throughout the european union  although this portion is expected to continue to decline as we execute our long term strategic plan 
during  our two largest customers for our components business each accounted for more than of our components business net sales 
our customer base within our components business is still concentrated to a significant extent in germany and  therefore  additional german fit reductions could reduce demand and or price levels for our modules sold to these customers 
the loss of any of our large customers  their inability to perform under their contracts  or their default in payment could significantly reduce our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 
our customers may face significant challenges under current economic conditions  including lack of capital to finance solar projects and rising costs associated with leasing or otherwise acquiring land and rooftops for solar projects 
although we believe that we can mitigate this risk in part by re allocating modules to other customers if the need arises  we may be unable  in whole or in part  to mitigate the reduced demand for our modules 
further  in the event that we determine that our planned production of solar modules exceeds the demand we anticipate  we may decide to reduce or halt production of solar modules in our manufacturing facilities 
however  we may incur costs in doing so and we may be unable to anticipate and respond to the oversupply of solar modules because we have limited visibility into our customers inventories 
risks related to regulations existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical  regulatory  and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv products  which may significantly reduce demand for our solar modules 
the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by foreign  federal  state  and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry  as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities 
these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer owned electricity generation 
in the united states and in a number of other countries  these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future 
these regulations and policies could deter end user purchases of pv products and investment in the research and development of pv technology 
for example  without a mandated regulatory exception for pv systems  utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid 
if these interconnection standby fees were applicable to pv systems  it is likely that they would increase the cost of using pv systems to our end users  which could make them less desirable  thereby adversely affecting our business  prospects  results of operations  and financial condition 
in addition  with respect to utilities that utilize a peak hour pricing policy or time of use pricing methods whereby the price of electricity is adjusted based on electricity supply and demand  electricity generated by pv systems currently benefits from competing primarily with expensive peak hour electricity  rather than the less expensive average price of electricity 
modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities  such as to a flat rate for all times of the day  would require pv systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources 
we anticipate that our solar systems and modules will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes  safety  environmental protection  utility interconnection and metering  and other matters 
it is difficult to track the requirements of individual jurisdictions and design equipment to comply with the varying standards 
any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar modules may result in significant additional expenses to us or our customers and  as a result  could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar systems and modules 
environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition  cash flows  and profitability 
our operations involve the use  handling  generation  processing  storage  transportation  and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national  state  local  and international levels 
these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the use  management  and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  the cleanup of contaminated sites  and occupational health and safety 
we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations 
in addition  violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subjected to substantial fines  penalties  criminal proceedings  third party property damage or personal injury claims  cleanup costs  or other costs 
such solutions could also result in substantial delay or termination of projects under construction within our systems business  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements  future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies  the implementation of new  more stringent laws and regulations  or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
in addition  our solar modules contain cadmium telluride and cadmium sulfide 
elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous material due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure 
although the risks of exposure to cadmium telluride are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium  the toxicological properties of cadmium telluride have not been thoroughly investigated and reported 
in our manufacturing operations  we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures  including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators  chemical goggles  and protective clothing 
in addition  we believe the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our end products is limited by the encapsulated nature of these materials in our products and the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products  and further minimized by the voluntary implementation in of our collection and recycling program for our solar modules 
while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates  end users  and the general public from adverse health effects that may arise from cadmium exposure  we cannot ensure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur 
any such exposure could result in future third party claims against us  as well as damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny of our products  which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products 
the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the use of cadmium in various products is also subject to governmental regulation in several countries 
more restrictive regulation in this area and or expansion of such regulation to additional countries could impact the manufacture  sale  collection  and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products 
risks related to our operations  manufacturing  and technology our operating history to date may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations 
our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business  financial performance  and prospects 
we may be unable to achieve similar growth  or grow at all  in future periods 
our ability to achieve similar growth in future periods is also affected by current economic conditions 
our past results occurred in an environment where  among other things  capital was at times more accessible to our customers to finance the cost of developing solar projects and economic incentives for solar power in certain core markets such as the german fit were more favorable 
accordingly  you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior period as an indication of our future performance 
we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules  as well as thin film solar modules  and solar thermal and concentrated pv systems  if global supply exceeds global demand  it could lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 
the solar energy and renewable energy industries are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry 
within the global pv industry  we face competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers  other thin film solar module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated pv technologies 
existing or future solar manufacturers might be acquired by larger companies with significant capital resources  thereby intensifying competition with us 
in addition  the introduction of a low cost disruptive technology could adversely affect our ability to compete  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 
even if demand for solar modules continues to grow  the rapid manufacturing capacity expansion undertaken by many solar module manufacturers  particularly manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules  has created and may continue to cause periods of structural imbalance during which supply exceeds demand 
see an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we believe a significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock would provide significant reductions in the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and lead to further pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially the oversupply of solar modules 
during any such period  our competitors could decide to reduce their sales prices in response to competition  even below their manufacturing costs  in order to generate sales 
other competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital  which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time 
as a result  we may be unable to sell our solar modules at attractive prices  or for a profit  during any period of excess supply of solar modules  which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 
also  we may decide to lower our average selling price to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition 
thin film technology has a short history  and our thin film technology and solar modules and systems may perform below expectations  problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant and or unexpected warranty and related expenses  damage our market reputation  and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 
researchers began developing thin film semiconductor technology over years ago  but were unable to integrate the technology into a solar module production line until about a decade ago 
our thin film technology and solar modules may not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how our solar modules will perform over their estimated year useful life 
we perform a variety of quality and life tests under different conditions 
however  if our thin film technology and solar modules perform below expectations  we could lose customers and face substantial warranty expense 
we have historically provided a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules 
for solar module sales made subsequent to september   we have increased the limited warranty we provide against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions from years to years 
we also warrant to our owners that solar modules installed in accordance with agreed upon specifications will produce at least of their power output rating during the first years following their installation and at least of their power output rating during the following years 
as a result  we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales 
as of december   our accrued warranty liability was million  of which  million was classified as current and million was classified as noncurrent 
during the period from june to june  a manufacturing excursion occurred whereby certain modules manufactured during that time period may experience premature power loss once installed in the field 
the root cause of the manufacturing excursion was identified and addressed in june beginning in  we initiated a voluntary remediation program beyond our standard warranty pursuant to which we made commitments to customers with systems containing modules affected by the manufacturing excursion that we would cover certain costs of remediation efforts 
we have expensed million total to date for the estimated costs of remediating systems affected by modules manufactured during the relevant period  including million for remediation expenses beyond our limited warranty obligations and million in product warranty expense reflecting the net increase in the expected number of replacement modules required in connection with our remediation efforts 
this estimate is based on our evaluation and consideration of the currently available information  including the estimated number of affected modules in the field  historical experience related to our remediation efforts  customer provided data related to potentially affected systems  and the estimated costs of performing the logistical services covered under our remediation program 
in addition to those customers with systems affected by modules manufactured during the relevant period that we have already identified  we are working with a number of additional customers who may have affected modules to complete our analysis of their claims 
based upon our experience to date with our remediation approach  together with the data currently available  we estimate that  if we ultimately remediate these systems under our current remediation program  we could incur additional costs related to our voluntary remediation program of up to approximately million 
this includes approximately million beyond our limited warranty obligations in connection with these claims  including the costs of actual remediation and the costs of additional compensation payments to customers under certain circumstances  and approximately million related to additional product warranty liability 
if any of our estimates related to the above referenced manufacturing excursion prove incorrect  we could be required to accrue additional expenses  which could adversely impact our financial position  operating results and cash flows 
although we believe we have taken corrective actions to avoid similar manufacturing excursions in the future  we cannot guarantee that our internal quality and testing programs will prevent a future manufacturing excursion from occurring 
any future manufacturing excursions including any commitments made by us to take remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond our limited warranty could adversely impact our financial position  operating results and cash flows 
although our power output warranty extends for years  our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since because of the limited operating history of our solar modules  we have been required to make assumptions regarding the durability and reliability of our solar modules 
our assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our solar modules  causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules in the future 
for example  our glass on glass solar modules could break  delaminate  or experience power degradation in excess of expectations  and our manufacturing operations could be subject to process variations that could cause affected modules to underperform compared to our expectations 
these risks could be amplified as we implement design and process changes in connection with our efforts to accelerate module conversion efficiency improvement and manufacturing production throughput as part of our long term strategic plan 
in addition  as we increase the number of installations in non temperate climates  in accordance with our long term strategic plan  we may experience increased failure rates due to deployment into such hot climates 
any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation  cause our sales to decline  require us to repair or replace the defective modules  and cause us to take voluntary remedial measures beyond warranty terms to enhance customer satisfaction  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
in addition to our solar module warranty described above  for solar power plants built by our epc team  we currently typically provide a limited epc warranty against defects in workmanship  engineering design  and installation services under normal use and service conditions for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a solar power plant or an energized section of a solar power plant 
in resolving claims under both the workmanship and design warranties  we have the option of either remedying the defect to the warranted level through repair  refurbishment  or replacement 
any widespread failures of solar power plants built by us could damage our market reputation  cause our sales to decline  cause us to incur unexpected costs to remedy defects or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations 
if our estimates regarding the future cost of collecting and recycling our solar modules are incorrect  we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and face a significant unplanned cash burden 
we pre fund our estimated future obligation for collecting and recycling our solar modules based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the modules  which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport  the cost of freight from the solar module s installation site to a recycling center  the material  labor  and capital costs of the recycling process  and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling 
we base our estimate on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules that do not pass our quality control tests and solar modules returned under our warranty  and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled 
if our estimates prove incorrect  we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or end users return their solar modules  which could harm our operating results 
in addition  our end users can return their solar modules at any time 
as a result  we could be required to collect and recycle our solar modules earlier than we expect 
our failure to further refine our technology and develop and introduce improved pv products could render our solar modules or systems uncompetitive and reduce our net sales  profitability  and or market share 
we need to continue to invest significant financial resources in research and development to continue to improve our module conversion efficiency  lower the levelized cost of electricity lcoe of our pv systems  and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar energy industry 
however  research and development activities are inherently uncertain  and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results 
we seek to continuously improve our products and processes  and the resulting changes carry potential risks in the form of delays  additional costs  or other unintended contingencies 
in addition  our significant expenditures on research and development may not produce corresponding benefits 
other companies are developing a variety of competing pv technologies  including copper indium gallium diselenide and amorphous silicon  which could produce solar modules or systems that prove more cost effective or have better performance than our solar modules or systems 
in addition  other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power production drawback of many renewable energy systems  or offers other value added improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners  in which case such companies could compete with us even if the lcoe associated with such new system is higher than that of our systems 
as a result  our solar modules or systems may be negatively differentiated or rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors  which would reduce our net sales  profitability and or market share 
in addition  we often forward price our products and services in anticipation of future cost reductions  and thus an inability to further refine our technology and execute our long term manufacturing cost and lcoe reduction objectives could adversely affect our margins and operating results 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly 
protection of our proprietary processes  methods  and other technology is critical to our business 
failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies 
we rely primarily on patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights  and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property 
we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development  and are currently pursuing such patent applications in the us and worldwide 
our existing patents and future patents could be challenged  invalidated  circumvented  or rendered unenforceable 
our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents  or if patents are issued to us  such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise  continuing technological innovation  and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property  such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise 
adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise 
in addition  others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means 
the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes  equipment  technology  trade secrets  and proprietary manufacturing expertise  methods  and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  effective patent  trademark  copyright  and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations 
in some countries we have not applied for patent  trademark  or copyright protection 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive 
also  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets  or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
we cannot assure you that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor 
such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business 
an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business  prospects  and reputation 
in addition  we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 
some of our key raw materials and components are either single sourced or sourced from a limited number of third party suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 
our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality  quantity  and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing cost 
some of our key raw materials and components are either single sourced or sourced from a limited number of third party suppliers 
as a result  the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations 
in addition  some of our suppliers are small companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we continue to expand rapidly 
we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms 
a constraint on our production may cause us to be unable to meet our capacity ramp plan and or our obligations under our customer contracts  which would have an adverse impact on our financial results 
a disruption in our supply chain for cadmium telluride  our semiconductor material  could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules and could adversely impact our profitability and long term growth prospects 
a key raw material we use in our production process is a cadmium telluride compound 
tellurium  one of the main components of cadmium telluride  is mainly produced as a by product of copper refining and  therefore  its supply is largely dependent upon demand for copper 
our supply of cadmium telluride could be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices 
if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for cadmium telluride  supply could be reduced and prices could increase 
if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium  they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts 
we may be unable to pass increases in the cost of our raw materials through to our customers because our customer contracts do not adjust for raw material price increases and are generally for a longer term than our raw material supply contracts 
a substantial increase in tellurium prices could adversely impact our profitability and long term growth objectives 
our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand and  when necessary  continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to such demand and add production lines in a cost effective manner  all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 
our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand and increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput over time in a cost effective and efficient manner 
if we cannot do so  we may be unable to expand our business  decrease our manufacturing cost per watt  maintain our competitive position  satisfy our contractual obligations  or sustain profitability 
see an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to expand production capacity is subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including the following making changes to our production process that are not properly qualified or that may cause problems with the quality of our solar modules  delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors  many of which may be beyond our control  such as our inability to secure successful contracts with equipment vendors  our custom built equipment taking longer and costing more to manufacture than expected and not operating as designed  delays or denial of required approvals by relevant government authorities  being unable to hire qualified staff  failure to execute our expansion plans effectively  manufacturing concentration risk resulting from a majority of production lines worldwide being located in one geographic area  malaysia  difficulty in balancing market demand and manufacturing production in an efficient and timely manner  potentially causing us to be manufacturing capacity constrained in some future periods or over supplied in others  and incurring manufacturing asset write downs  write offs and other charges and costs  which may be significant  during those periods in which we idle  slow down or shut down manufacturing capacity 
if our future production lines are not built in line with our committed schedules it may impair our growth plans 
if our future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines  our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 
if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines as necessary over time and achieve and sustain similar operating metrics in our future production lines as we have achieved at our existing production lines  our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained  our manufacturing costs per watt could increase  and this may impair our growth plans and or cause us to lose customers  resulting in lower net sales  higher liabilities  and lower net income than we anticipate 
for instance  future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower conversion efficiencies  higher failure rates  and higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines  and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance 
in addition  we might be unable to produce enough solar modules to satisfy our contractual requirements under our customer contracts 
some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced 
if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts  we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 
some of our manufacturing equipment is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to the equipment manufacturer  which then undertakes a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment 
as a result  the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working 
if any piece of equipment fails  production along the entire production line could be interrupted 
in addition  the failure of our equipment suppliers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion plans and otherwise disrupt our production schedule or increase our manufacturing costs  all of which would adversely impact our financial results 
if we are unable to further increase the number of sellable watts per solar module and reduce our manufacturing cost per watt  our profitability could decline 
our profitability could decline if we are unable to continue to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt 
furthermore  our failure to reduce cost per watt by increasing our efficiency may impair our ability to enter new markets that we believe will require lower cost per watt for us to be competitive and may impair our growth plans 
we may be unable to manage the expansion of our operations effectively 
we expect to continue to expand our business in order to provide utility scale pv generation to existing and new geographic markets and to maintain or increase market share 
to manage the continued expansion of our operations  we will be required to continue to improve our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  and expand  train  and manage our growing associate base 
our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers  suppliers  and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers 
in addition  our current and planned operations  personnel  systems  and internal controls and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth 
if we cannot manage our growth effectively  we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities  execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures 
implementing a new enterprise resource planning system could interfere with our business or operations and could adversely impact our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system 
phase of this implementation was completed in the second half of  and the second phase of this implementation was completed in the second half of this project requires significant investment of capital and human resources  the re engineering of many processes of our business  and the attention of many associates and managers who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business 
any disruptions  delays  or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new erp system could result in potentially much higher costs than we had anticipated and could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders  ship products  provide services and support to customers  bill and track our customers  fulfill contractual obligations  file sec reports in a timely manner and or otherwise operate our business  or otherwise impact our controls environment  and any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks  including unfavorable political  regulatory  labor  and tax conditions in foreign countries 
we have significant marketing  distribution  and manufacturing operations both within and outside the united states 
in  of our net sales were generated from customers headquartered in the european union 
we expect to continue to expand our operations into china  india  other countries in europe  asia  the middle east  and elsewhere  as a result  we will be subject to the legal  political  social  tax  and regulatory requirements  and economic conditions of many jurisdictions 
risks inherent to international operations  include  but are not limited to  the following difficulty in enforcing agreements in foreign legal systems  varying degrees of protection afforded to foreign investments in the countries in which we operate  and irregular interpretations and enforcement of laws and regulations in these jurisdictions  foreign countries may impose additional income and withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign operations  impose tariffs  or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade and investment  including currency exchange controls  fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect our profitability in us dollars to the extent the price of our solar modules and cost of raw materials  labor  and equipment is denominated in a foreign currency  inability to obtain  maintain  or enforce intellectual property rights  risk of nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises  changes in general economic and political conditions in the countries in which we operate  including changes in the government incentives we are relying on  unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements  including those with respect to environmental protection  export duties  and quotas  opaque approval processes in which the lack of transparency may cause delays and increase the uncertainty of project approvals  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  difficulty in repatriating earnings  difficulty in negotiating a successful collective bargaining agreement in applicable foreign jurisdictions  trade barriers such as export requirements  tariffs  taxes  local content requirements  and other restrictions and expenses  which could increase the price of our solar modules and make us less competitive in some countries  and difficulty of  and costs relating to  compliance with the different commercial and legal requirements of the overseas countries in which we offer and sell our solar modules 
our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries 
our overall success as a global business depends  in part  on our ability to succeed in differing legal  regulatory  economic  social  and political conditions 
we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 
risks related to our systems business project development or construction activities may not be successful and projects under development may not receive required permits  real property rights  power purchase agreements ppas  interconnection and transmission arrangements or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled  which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 
the development and construction of solar power electric generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks 
we may be required to spend significant sums for land and interconnection rights  preliminary engineering  permitting  legal  and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible  economically attractive  or capable of being built 
success in developing a particular project is contingent upon  among other things obtaining satisfactory land rights  including environmental mitigation lands  receipt from governmental agencies of required land use and construction permits and approvals  receipt of rights to interconnect the project to the electric grid or to transmit energy  payment of interconnection and other deposits some of which are non refundable  negotiation of satisfactory engineering  procurement  and construction agreements  entering into financeable arrangements for the purchase of the electrical output and renewable energy attributes generated by the project  securing a project site and necessary rights of way  obtaining construction financing  including debt  equity and funds associated with the monetization of tax credits and other tax benefits  and timely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction 
successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by numerous factors  including delays in obtaining and maintaining required governmental permits and approvals  including appeals of approvals obtained  potential challenges from project stakeholders  including local residents  environmental organizations  and others who may not support the project  unforeseen engineering problems  construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls  work stoppages  cost over runs  labor  equipment and materials supply shortages or disruptions  additional complexities when conducting project development or construction activities in foreign jurisdictions  including operating in accordance with the us foreign corrupt practices act and applicable local laws and customs  unfavorable tax treatment  adverse weather conditions  adverse environmental and geological conditions  and force majeure and other events out of our control 
if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power facility  we fail to meet one or more agreed target construction milestone dates  any agreed upon system level capacity or energy output guarantees or warranties including  for some projects  twenty five year energy performance or system level module degradation warranties and guarantees  or other contract terms  or our projects cause grid interference or other damage  we may be subject to forfeiture of significant deposits under power purchase agreements or interconnection agreements or termination of such agreements  significant liquidated damages  penalties and or other obligations under the epc agreement or other agreements relating to the project including obligations to repair  replace and or supplement additional modules and balance of system materials for the project  particularly if our liabilities are not capped under the terms of such agreement  and we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project 
some of these penalties might require us to repurchase the project from the buyer or to down size the project  under certain circumstances 
if we were required to repurchase a project  we may have insufficient cash or capital resources necessary to make the repurchase payment or we may be unable to resell the project in a timely manner or on terms commercially satisfactory to us  which would adversely impact our results of operations 
some of these investments are included as assets on our consolidated balance sheet under the line item project assets 
if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power project  we may write down or write off some or all of these capitalized investments  which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized 
in  we expect to invest a significant amount of capital to develop projects owned by us or third parties  which may limit the availability of capital to use for other purposes  such as contract damages or repurchase payments 
we may enter into fixed price epc contracts in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the installation of their solar power systems 
all essential costs are estimated at the time of entering into the epc contract for a particular project  and these are reflected in the overall fixed price that we charge our customers for the project 
these cost estimates are preliminary and may or may not be covered by contracts between us or the subcontractors  suppliers  and other parties to the project 
in addition  we require qualified  licensed subcontractors to install most of our systems 
shortages of such skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs 
should miscalculations in planning a project occur including those due to unexpected increases in inflation  commodity prices or labor costs or delays in execution occur and we are unable to increase commensurately the epc sales price  we may not achieve our expected margins or we may be required to record a loss in the relevant fiscal period 
we may be unable to acquire or lease land  obtain necessary interconnection and transmission rights  and or obtain the approvals  licenses  permits and electric transmission grid interconnection and transmission rights necessary to build and operate pv power plants in a timely and cost effective manner  and regulatory agencies  local communities  labor unions or other third parties may delay  prevent  or increase the cost of construction and operation of the pv plants we intend to build 
in order to construct and operate our pv plants  we need to acquire or lease land and rights of way  obtain interconnection rights  and obtain all necessary local  county  state  federal  and foreign approvals  licenses  and permits as well as rights to interconnect the plants to the transmission grid and transmit energy generated from the plant 
we may be unable to acquire the land or lease interests needed  may not obtain satisfactory interconnection rights  may not receive or retain the requisite approvals  permits  licenses and interconnection and transmission rights  or may encounter other problems which could delay or prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants 
many of our proposed pv plants are located on or require access through public lands administered by federal and state agencies pursuant to competitive public leasing and right of way procedures and processes 
the authorization for the use  construction  and operation of pv plants and associated transmission facilities on federal  state  and private lands will also require the assessment and evaluation of mineral rights  private rights of way  and other easements  environmental  agricultural  cultural  recreational  and aesthetic impacts  and the likely mitigation of adverse impacts to these and other resources and uses 
the inability to obtain the required permits and  potentially  excessive delay in obtaining such permits due  for example  to litigation or third party appeals  could prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants in a timely manner and could result in a potential forfeiture of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project 
moreover  project approvals subject to project modifications and conditions  including mitigation requirements and costs  could affect the financial success of a given project 
in addition  local labor unions may increase the cost of  and or lower the productivity of  project development in canada  california  and elsewhere 
we may also be subject to labor unavailability and or increased union labor requirements due to multiple simultaneous projects in a geographic region 
lack of transmission capacity availability  potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid  and other systems constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity power sales 
in order to deliver electricity from our pv plants to our customers  our projects need to connect to the transmission grid 
the lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size  delays in project implementation  increases in costs from transmission upgrades  and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project 
these transmission issues  as well as issues relating to the availability of large systems such as transformers and switch gear  could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity sales 
our systems business is largely dependent on us and third parties arranging financing from various sources  which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 
the construction of the large utility scale solar power projects under development by us is expected in many cases to require project financing  including non recourse project debt financing in the bank loan market and institutional debt capital markets 
uncertainties exist as to whether our projects will be able to access the debt markets in a magnitude sufficient to finance their construction 
if we are unable to arrange such financing or if it is only available on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plan 
in addition  we generally expect to sell our projects by raising project equity capital from tax oriented  strategic industry  and other equity investors 
such equity sources may not be available or may only be available in insufficient amounts  in which case our ability to sell our projects may be delayed or limited and our business  financial condition  or results of operations may be adversely affected 
even if such financing sources are available  the counterparty to many of our fixed price epc contracts  which own the project we are constructing  are often special purpose vehicles that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project and have pledged all or substantially all of these assets to secure the project related debt and certain other sources of financing 
if the owner defaults on its payment or other obligations to us  we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended or committed to be expended to purchase equipment or supplies including intercompany purchases of pv modules  or for termination payments we are entitled to under the terms of the related epc contract 
if we are unable to collect the amounts owed to us  or are unable to complete the project because of an owner default  we may be required to record a charge against earnings related to the project  which could result in a material loss 
in addition  for projects to which we provide epc services but are not the project developer  our epc activities are in many cases dependent on the ability of third parties to finance their pv plant projects  which  in turn  is dependent on their ability to obtain financing for such purchases on acceptable terms 
depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets  interest rates and other factors  such financing may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 
if third parties are limited in their ability to access financing to support their purchase of pv power plant construction services from us  we may not realize the cash flows that we expect from such sales  and this could adversely affect our ability to invest in our business and or generate revenue 
see also the risk factor above entitled an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for end users to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar modules and or lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules 
developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to the signing of an epc contract and commencing construction  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our solar power project development cycles  which span the time between the identification of land and the commercial operation of a pv power plant project  vary substantially and can take many months or years to mature 
as a result of these long project cycles  we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources including  for example  payments for land rights  large transmission and ppa deposits or other payments  which may be non refundable in advance of the signing of epc contracts and commencing construction and the receipt of any revenue  much of which is not recognized for several additional months or years following contract signing 
our potential inability to enter into sales contracts with potential customers after making such upfront investments could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
furthermore  we may become constrained in our ability to simultaneously fund our other business operations and these systems investments through our long project development cycles 
our liquidity may be adversely affected to the extent the project sale market weakens and we are unable to sell our solar projects on pricing  terms and timing commercially acceptable to us 
we may not be able to obtain long term contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing and other investments 
obtaining long term contracts for the sale of power produced by the projects at prices and on other terms favorable to us is essential for obtaining financing and commencing construction of our projects 
we must compete for power purchase agreements against other developers of solar and renewable energy projects 
further  other sources of power  such as natural gas fired power plants  have historically been cheaper than the cost of solar power and power from certain types of projects  such as natural gas fired power plants  can be delivered on a firm basis 
the inability to compete successfully against other power producers or otherwise enter into ppas favorable to us would negatively affect our ability to develop and finance our projects and negatively impact our revenue 
in addition  the availability of power purchase agreements is a function of a number of economic  regulatory  tax and public policy factors 
we may be subject to unforeseen costs  liabilities or obligations when providing o m services 
for solar power plants which we have developed and built  we may provide ongoing o m services to the system owner under fixed price long term service agreements  pursuant to which we generally perform all scheduled and unscheduled maintenance for the system  perform operating and other asset management services for the system and provide an availability guarantee for the system 
our costs to perform these services are estimated at the time of entering into the o m agreement for a particular project  and these are reflected in the fixed price that we charge our customers under the o m agreement 
we do not have extensive experience in performing o m services for pv solar power plants and estimating actual costs to serve under our o m agreements relative to the price that we charge our customers  particularly in foreign jurisdictions in which we plan to offer pv systems solutions as part of our long term strategic plan 
should miscalculations in estimating these costs occur including those due to unexpected increases in inflation or labor or bos costs  our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected 
because of the long term nature of these o m agreements  such as years  such adverse impacts on results of operations could be significant  particularly if our liabilities are not capped or subject to an above market liability cap under the terms of the o m agreement 
we also could be subject to substantial costs  liabilities or obligations in the event our solar systems do not meet any agreed upon system level availability  energy or performance guarantees or warranties 
other risks we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions  and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management 
we have made several acquisitions in the last several years  and in the future we may acquire additional companies  project pipelines  products  or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and each acquisition has numerous risks 
these risks include the following difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company  difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  difficulty in maintaining controls  procedures  and policies during the transition and integration  disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and associates from other opportunities and challenges due to integration issues  difficulty integrating the acquired company s accounting  management information  and other administrative systems  inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired business  inability to retain key customers  vendors  and other business partners of the acquired business  inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses  incurring acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results  potential impairment of our relationships with our associates  customers  partners  distributors  or third party providers of technology or products  potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality  legal and financial liabilities  among other things  potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective  potential inability to obtain  or obtain in a timely manner  approvals from governmental authorities  which could delay or prevent such acquisitions  and potential delay in customer purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product offerings 
mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky  and ultimately  if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 
we are dependent on the services of our executive officers and other members of our senior management team 
the loss of one or more of these key associates or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may not be able to retain or replace these key associates  and we may not have adequate succession plans in place 
several of our current key associates including our executive officers are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain post employment non competition provisions 
however  these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice and the enforceability of the non competition provisions is uncertain 
our current chief executive officer has been serving on an interim basis since october we could be subject to management disruptions or distractions resulting from any extended delay in hiring a new chief executive officer or from such new chief executive officer s integration into the company 
if we are unable to attract  train  and retain key personnel  our business may be materially and adversely affected 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  on our ability to attract  train  and retain management  operations  and technical personnel 
recruiting and retaining capable personnel  particularly those with expertise in the pv industry and thin film technology  are vital to our success 
there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain our technical personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates  or otherwise experience labor disruptions our business may be materially and adversely affected 
certain types of services provided by onsite workers are subject to the davis bacon act 
the davis bacon act requires that a contractor pay all personnel assigned to the contract at least the prevailing wage and fringe benefits  as established by and in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the department of labor 
we have an established policy pursuant to which we evaluate davis bacon act requirements and ensure our compliance with these requirements 
if the department of labor were to determine that anyone working under such contracts were not properly classified  or were being paid the incorrect prevailing wage  we could incur additional liability with respect to such workers 
any such liability incurred above our anticipated costs for these services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties  which  if determined adversely to us  could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 
our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and know how without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties 
the validity and scope of claims relating to pv technology patents involve complex scientific  legal  and factual considerations and analysis and  therefore  may be highly uncertain 
we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  patent opposition proceedings  and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties  which may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or pay ongoing royalties  require us to redesign our solar module  or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies 
protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 
currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales  cost of sales  and gross margins and could result in exchange losses 
although our reporting currency is the us dollar  we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate 
as a result  we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk 
for example  and of our net sales were denominated in euros for the years ended december  and december   respectively  and we expect a large percentage of our net sales to be outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies in the future 
in addition  our operating expenses for our manufacturing plants located outside the us and our operations for our systems business in foreign countries will generally be denominated in the local currency 
changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange gains or losses 
for example  during our net sales was reduced by million due to a decrease in the blended exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar 
in addition  we incur currency translation risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from our reporting currency 
for example  our supply contracts specify pricing in euros through and do not adjust for changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rate 
we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 
we could also expand our business into emerging markets  many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy 
conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase 
our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us 
deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposure  and therefore  result in exchange gains or losses 
the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in europe could adversely impact our business 
the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in europe and its impact on the balance sheets and lending practices of european banks in particular could negatively impact our access to  and cost of  capital  and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and competitive position 
it could also similarly affect our customers and therefore limit the sales of our modules and demand for our systems business as well 
the european sovereign debt crisis may also cause european governments to reduce  eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy  which could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the estate of john t 
walton and its affiliates have significant control over us and their interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 
our largest stockholder  the estate of john t 
walton and its affiliates  including jcl holdings  llc and jtw trust no 
uad collectively  the estate  owned approximately of our outstanding common stock at december  as a result  the estate has substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers  tender offers  and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
the interests of the estate could conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 
for example  the concentration of ownership held by the estate could delay  defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger  takeover  or other business combination which a majority of stockholders may view favorably 
if our goodwill or project assets become impaired  we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements should we determine that our goodwill or project assets are impaired 
such a charge might have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of we recorded goodwill impairment expense of million related to our components reporting unit as discussed further in note goodwill and intangible assets  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
as required by accounting rules  we review our goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill might not be recoverable include a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant decline in projections of future cash flows and lower future growth rates in our industry 
we review project assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we consider a project commercially viable and recoverable if it is anticipated to be saleable for a profit once it is either fully developed or fully constructed 
if our projects are not considered commercially viable  we would be required to impair the respective project assets 
unanticipated changes in our tax provisions  the adoption of a new us tax legislation  or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory  services  licenses  funding  and other items in inter company transactions 
we are subject to potential tax examinations in these various jurisdictions 
tax authorities may disagree with our inter company charges  cross jurisdictional transfer pricing or other tax positions and assess additional taxes 
we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision in accordance with asc  income taxes 
however  there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential examinations  and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore  could have a material impact on our tax provision  net income  and cash flows 
in addition  our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure  loss of our malaysian tax holiday  changes in the mix of earnings in countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in tax laws  and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process 
in addition  recently announced proposals for new us tax legislation could have a material effect on the results of our operations  if enacted 
our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 
we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions  engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us  and obtain additional financing  if needed  because our revolving credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  and our malaysian and german facility agreements contain  and any of our other future debt agreements may contain  covenant restrictions that limit our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  assume obligations in connection with letters of credit  or issue guarantees  create liens  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates  sell certain assets  and declare or pay dividends  make other distributions to stockholders  or make other restricted payments 
under our revolving credit agreement and our malaysian and german facility agreements  we are also subject to certain financial condition covenants 
our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreements is dependent on our future performance  which will be subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including prevailing economic conditions 
in addition  our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements and any of our other future debt agreements  which if not cured or waived  could permit the holders thereof to accelerate such debt and could cause cross defaults under our other facility agreements and the possible acceleration of debt under such other facility agreements  as well as cross defaults under certain of our key project and operational agreements 
in addition  we cannot assure you that events that occur within the company  or in the industry or the economy as a whole  will not constitute material adverse effects under these agreements 
if it is determined that a material adverse effect has occurred  the lenders can  under certain circumstances  restrict future borrowings or accelerate the due date of outstanding loan balances 
if any of our debt is accelerated  we may in the future not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt  and we may experience cross defaults under our other debt agreements or project and key operational agreements  which could materially and negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations

overview we manufacture and sell solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology  and we design  construct  and sell photovoltaic pv solar power systems 
in furtherance of our goal of delivering the lowest cost of solar electricity and achieving price parity with conventional fossil fuel based peak electricity generation  we are continually focused on reducing pv solar system costs in four primary areas module manufacturing  balance of systems bos costs consisting of the costs of the components of a solar power system other than the solar modules  such as inverters  mounting hardware  grid interconnection equipment  wiring and other devices  and installation labor costs  project development costs  and the cost of capital 
first  with respect to our module manufacturing costs  our advanced technology has allowed us to reduce our average module manufacturing costs to the lowest in the world for modules produced on a commercial scale  based on publicly available information 
in  our total average manufacturing costs were per watt  which we believe is less than those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers 
by continuing to improve conversion efficiency and production line throughput  lower material costs  and drive volume scale to further decrease overhead costs  we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain our cost advantage over traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers 
second  with respect to our bos costs  by continuing to improve conversion efficiency  leverage volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms  and accelerate installation times  we believe we can continue to make reductions in bos costs  which represent over half of all of the costs associated with a typical utility scale pv solar power system 
third  with respect to our project development costs  we seek optimal site locations in an effort to minimize transmission and permitting costs  and to accelerate lead times to electricity generation 
finally  with respect to our cost of capital  by continuing to strengthen our financial position  demonstrate the financial viability and operational performance of our utility scale pv solar power plants  and increase our pv solar power system operating experience  we believe we can continue to lower the cost of capital associated with our pv solar power systems  thereby further enhancing the economic viability of our projects and lowering the cost of electricity generated by pv solar power systems that incorporate our modules and technology 
we believe that combining our reliable  low cost module manufacturing capability with our systems business enables us to more rapidly reduce the price of solar electricity  accelerate the adoption of our technology in utility scale pv solar power systems  identify and remove constraints on the successful migration to sustainable solar markets around the world  and further our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean  affordable solar electricity 
we operate our business in two segments 
our components segment designs  manufactures  and sells solar modules primarily to solar project developers and system integrators 
through our systems segment  we have the capability to provide a complete pv solar power system  using our solar modules  for utility scale or large commercial systems 
providing a complete pv solar power system includes project development  engineering  procurement  and construction epc  operating and maintenance o m services and monitoring and diagnostics m d services  when applicable  and facilitating project finance  when required 
we view the sale of solar modules from the components segment as the core driver of our profitability  return on net assets  and cash throughput 
we view our systems segment as an enabler to drive module throughput for our components business with the objective of achieving break even results before income taxes for our systems segment

market overview the solar industry experienced a challenging environment in the year was categorized by intense pricing competition  bankruptcies of several solar companies  many solar companies with little or no operating income  and toward the end of the year  announcements of manufacturing shut downs or slow downs 
at december   the global pv industry consisted of more than manufacturers of solar modules and cells 
in the aggregate  these manufactuers have installed production capacity that significantly exceeded global demand in as a result  industry average module pricing declined significantly as competitors reduced prices to sell through inventories in europe and elsewhere 
we believe this structural imbalance between supply and demand ie  where production capacity significantly exceeds current global demand may continue for the foreseeable future  and we expect it will continue to put pressure on pricing and our results of operations in in light of such market realities  we have begun to execute our long term strategic plan under which we are focusing on our competitive strengths  notably providing utility scale pv generation solutions to sustainable geographic markets that have an immediate need for mass scale pv electricity 
in addressing overall growing global demand for pv solar electricity  we have developed a differentiated  fully integrated systems business that can provide a low cost turn key utility scale pv system solution for system owners and low cost electricity to utility end users 
our fully integrated systems business has enabled us to increase module throughput  drive cost reduction across the value chain  identify and break constraints to sustainable markets  and deliver the most compelling solutions to our customers and end users 
with our fully integrated systems business  we believe we are in a position to expand our business in transition markets and eventually economically sustainable markets in which support programs are minimal  which are expected to develop in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand 
we are committed to continually lowering the cost of solar electricity  and in the long term  we plan to compete on an economic basis with conventional fossil fuel based peaking power generation 
the major european governments continue to seek to balance subsidy costs with their commitment to the eu directive s goal of a share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by governments in germany  france  and italy continue to evaluate changes to their fit structures  market caps  and or tender processes 
in many instances  such proposed fit structures would particularly impact the competitiveness of our core offering of large scale free field pv systems and modules to be installed in such systems 
for instance  the german government recently proposed significant and accelerated fit reductions for projects up to mw and an elimination of fits for projects over mw 
the resulting market uncertainties  together with increased european financing environment constraints  have contributed to demand pauses and increased customer difficulties in  which  in conjunction with increased industry wide manufacturing capacity  have contributed to excess industry channel inventories 
in  industry average module pricing declined significantly as competitors reduced prices to sell through inventories in europe and elsewhere in light of these factors 
lower industry module pricing  while currently challenging for solar manufacturers  in particular those with high cost structures  is expected to continue to contribute to global market diversification and volume elasticity 
over time  declining average selling prices are consistent with the erosion of one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration  namely its overall affordability 
in the near term  however  in light of continually evolving fit structures in our core european markets and increased industry wide manufacturing capacity  it is uncertain whether growing demand from other countries and markets could absorb industry wide module supply without further inventory build up and or price reductions  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
if competitors reduce module pricing to levels below their manufacturing costs  or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time  our results of operations could be further adversely affected 
we continue to mitigate this uncertainty in part by executing on and building our north american utility scale systems pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations in europe and elsewhere  by accelerating our thin film module efficiency improvements and cost reduction roadmaps to increase our competitive advantage  profitability and capital efficiency  by adjusting our production plans and capacity utilization to match expected demand  and by continuing the development of other geographic markets  including those in india  australia  the middle east  south america  and china 
the development of market demand outside of the european union continued during  in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices  which make solar power more affordable to new markets 
in india  we entered into a mw direct current dc module supply agreement the largest pv module supply agreement in india to date with one of india s leading power generation companies 
in australia  we were contracted to provide our modules  epc  and o m services for australia s first utility scale solar power project  a mw alternating current ac solar farm that will help power the southern seawater desalination plant in western australia 
in north america  we have continued to execute on our utility scale systems pipeline 
we made substantial construction progress on the mw ac agua caliente project in arizona during  the financial impact of which is reflected below under results of operations 
on september   we announced the sales and construction plans for what will be two of the world s largest solar pv facilities  both in california 
the two projects sold in the third quarter are the mw ac desert sunlight solar farm  located west of blythe  california  and the mw ac antelope valley solar ranch one project  located just north of los angeles  california 
in january  we announced completion of the sale of the mw ac topaz solar farm  located in san luis obispo county  california 
in the pv module segment  we continue to face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and pv systems 
solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product performance attributes  including reliability and module cost per watt  and  with respect to solar power systems  return on equity roe and levelized cost of electricity lcoe  meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the solar power project divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the system s life 
the ability to expand manufacturing capacity quickly is another source of differentiation among solar module manufacturers  and certain of our competitors may have a faster response time to capacity expansion than we do and or an ability to expand capacity in finer increments than we can 
we are the lowest cost pv module manufacturer in the solar industry for modules produced on a commercial scale  based on publicly available information  and our average manufacturing cost per watt declined from during to during this cost advantage is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules or fully integrated systems and enables our systems to compete favorably in respect of their roe or lcoe 
our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our proprietary technology which enables conversion efficiency improvements and enables us to produce a module in less than hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process  as opposed to a batch process  our scale  and our operational excellence 
in addition  our modules use approximately of the amount of semiconductor material ie  silicon that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules 
the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules  and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels 
polysilicon costs declined in  contributing to a decline in our manufacturing cost advantage over crystalline silicon module manufacturers 
although we are not a crystalline silicon module manufacturer  we estimate  based on industry research and public disclosures of our competitors  that a per kg increase or decrease in the price of polysilicon could increase or decrease  respectively  our competitors manufacturing cost per watt by approximately to over time 
given the lower conversion efficiency of our modules compared to crystalline silicon modules  there may be higher bos costs associated with systems using our modules 
thus  to compete effectively on the basis of lcoe  our modules need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline silicon based modules 
during  we reduced our manufacturing cost per watt by from our cost per watt in and continued to reduce bos costs associated with systems using our modules 
while our modules currently enjoy competitive advantages in these product performance attributes  there can be no guarantee that these advantages will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all 
any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in additional margin compression  further declines in the average selling prices of our solar modules  erosion in our market share for modules  decreases in the rate of revenue growth  and or declines in overall revenues 
we have taken  and continue to take  various actions to mitigate the potential impact resulting from competitive pressures  including adjusting our pricing policies as necessary in core market segments to drive module volumes  accelerating progress along our module and bos cost reduction roadmaps  and focusing our research and development on increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules 
as we expand our systems business into transition and sustainable markets  we can offer value beyond the pv module  reduce our exposure to module only competition  provide differentiated offerings to minimize the impact of solar module commoditization  and provide comprehensive utility scale pv systems solutions that significantly reduce solar electricity costs 
thus  our systems business allows us to play a more active role than many of our competitors in managing the demand for our solar modules 
finally  we seek to form and develop strong partner relationships with our customers and continue to develop our range of offerings  including epc capabilities and o m or m d services  in order to enhance the competitiveness of systems using our solar modules 
long term strategic plan in december we announced a long term strategic plan long term strategic plan or ltsp with a goal to transition to primarily sustainable opportunities by the end of in executing the ltsp we will focus on providing solar pv generation solutions to sustainable geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for mass scale pv electricity  including new markets throughout the americas  asia  the middle east  and africa 
as part of our ltsp  we expect to focus on opportunities in which our solar pv generation solutions will compete directly with fossil fuel offerings on a levelized cost of energy basis and decrease our focus on rooftop solar 
execution of the ltsp will entail a reallocation of resources around the globe  in particular dedicating resources to regions such as latin america  asia  the middle east  and africa where we have not traditionally conducted significant business to date 
we will evaluate and manage closely the appropriate level of resources required as we transition into and penetrate these specific markets 
we intend to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of solar pv generation  to optimize the design and logistics around our solar pv generation solutions  and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of the specific region 
manufacturing capacity as of december   we operated production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately gw at our manufacturing plants in perrysburg  ohio  frankfurt oder  germany  and kulim  malaysia 
in order to better align production with expected market demand  we expect to produce between approximately gw to gw of solar modules in  reflecting a manufacturing capacity utilization rate of approximately to  compared to an expected manufacturing capacity of approximately gw at the end of we expect to adjust such production plans in the future to match the then current expected market demand 
we plan to idle half of our production capacity in our frankfurt oder manufacturing facility for a period of time beginning in march we also plan to strategically idle additional production capacity to implement upgraded process technologies across existing manufacturing lines as part of our accelerated conversion efficiency improvement initiatives 
we plan to take the kulim production lines down on a rolling schedule for maintenance and equipment upgrades during the balancing of our production capabilities with market demand is a core component of our manufacturing capacity expansion strategy and our long term strategic plan 
to that end in february we decided not to proceed with our previously announced line plant in vietnam 
see note restructuring and acquisitions  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we have also postponed the commissioning of our previously announced line plant in mesa  arizona and the construction of our previously announced line plant in france until such time as global supply and demand dynamics support the additional manufacturing capacity in such geographic areas 
manufacturing excursion during the period from june to june  a manufacturing excursion occurred whereby certain modules manufactured during that time period may experience premature power loss once installed in the field 
the root cause of the manufacturing excursion was identified and addressed in june beginning in  we initiated a voluntary remediation program beyond our standard limited warranty pursuant to which we made commitments to customers with systems containing modules manufactured during the relevant period that we would cover certain costs of remediation efforts 
these remediation efforts included module removal  replacement and logistical services and additional compensation payments to customers under certain circumstances 
our best estimate for costs of our voluntary remediation program  as of and in each fiscal period in question  has been based on evaluation and consideration of the then currently available information  including the estimated number of affected modules in the field  historical experience related to our voluntary remediation efforts  customer provided data related to potentially affected systems and the estimated costs of performing the logistical services covered under our remediation program 
as part of our voluntary remediation program  we have worked with our customers to identify systems that are potentially affected by modules manufactured during the relevant period 
although we have been able to identify potentially affected systems  the logistics costs of identifying  testing and replacing individual affected modules within a site once they have been installed renders searching for and replacing individual affected modules impracticable for us when we are not the owner or operator of the site 
in many cases we elected to remediate our customers sites such that their overall site performance matched the customers expectations  and in doing so we determined that it was more efficient to either replace all modules within a site  for certain smaller sites below a size threshold  or  for larger sites  to identify groups  or strings  of modules that are underperforming  and replace the entire group or string with new modules 
the additional information provided from sites that we have already remediated and modules we have removed and tested  permits us to identify the expected total number of modules necessary to remediate sites with potentially affected modules to match customers expectations  and to refine the cost estimates for our voluntary remediation program 
as we have continued remediation efforts under our voluntary remediation program  we have learned that  in light of the impracticality of identifying and replacing individual affected models  in order to remediate the energy loss impact at a system level  we are required to remove and replace several modules in the aggregate  including modules that might not have been affected by the manufacturing excursion 
removed modules are returned to us and are further tested to determine if the module can be resold or whether the module requires recycling under our solar module collection and recycling program 
in the fourth quarter of  we accrued additional expenses in excess of standard product warranty liability relating to our voluntary remediation program 
a principal driver behind such additional accrual was our greater understanding as of year end  obtained through the processing of thousands of claims as described below  of the number of modules not affected in the manufacturing excursion that needed to be removed and subsequently replaced in order for us to be able to identify and remedy the number of modules actually affected by the manufacturing excursion 
for additional information regarding accrued expenses in excess of standard product warranty liability relating to our voluntary remediation program  see note consolidated balance sheet details  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our voluntary remediation program  and the related manufacturing excursion  also resulted in changes in estimates to our product warranty liability 
for additional information regarding these changes  see note commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
in response to our communications to customers regarding our intent to undertake a voluntary remediation program  we received more than five thousand customer claims  which covered an installed base greater than our entire production output during the june june timeframe 
in our processing of these claims to date  we have determined that we will take remediation actions in accordance with our voluntary remediation program with respect to approximately  of such claims  approximately an additional claims could  pending receipt of additional information  qualify for remediation  and the balance of approximately  claims have been or will be rejected as they did not meet the criteria for participation in our voluntary remediation program including claims containing insufficient data necessary to evaluate them 
we have expensed million total to date for the estimated costs of remediating systems affected by modules manufactured during the relevant period  including million for remediation expenses beyond our limited warranty obligations and million in product warranty expense reflecting the net increase in the expected number of replacement modules required in connection with our remediation efforts  as described in more detail under results of operations fiscal years ended december  and december  cost of sales and results of operations fiscal years ended december  and december  selling  general and administrative 
in addition to those customers with systems containing modules affected by the manufacturing excursion that we have already identified  we are working with a number of additional customers who have made claims and may have affected modules 
we are in the process of gathering information to complete our analysis of these remaining claims 
based upon our experience to date with our remediation approach  together with the data currently available  we estimate that  if we ultimately remediate these systems under our current remediation program  we could incur additional costs of up to approximately million 
this includes approximately million beyond our limited warranty obligations in connection with these claims  including the costs of actual remediation and the costs of additional compensation payments to customers under certain circumstances  and approximately million related to additional product warranty liability 
module installation in non temperate climates we believe our pv modules are potentially subject to increased failure rates in hot climates 
this assumption is based on technical literature  data that we have developed internally including through accelerated life testing  our analysis of modules returned under warranty  and our analysis of performance data from systems that we monitor under o m agreements 
processes that are accelerated by higher ambient temperatures include stress corrosion cracking in glass  polymer creepage and impurity diffusion processes 
for more information about risks related to thin film module product performance  please see item a thin film technology has a short history  and our thin film technology and solar modules and systems may perform below expectations  problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant and or unexpected warranty and related expenses  damage our market reputation  and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 
first solar has an extensive deployment history in temperate climates  such as europe 
our deployed volume into hot climates  such as the southwestern united states  is mostly recent 
we have increased our warranty reserve by million to reflect our exposure to this shift in the mix of geographic regions where our modules are installed 
as we execute on our long term strategic plan  we expect to install higher volumes in non temperate climates as part of our utility scale offerings in asia  the middle east  africa  australia and the southwestern united states 
accordingly  we will continue to review our warranty reserve in the future to reflect actual installations in such non temperate climates and adjust such reserve as appropriate

financial operations overview the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results 
net sales components business during  the majority of our net sales were generated from the sale of solar modules 
we generally price and sell our solar modules per watt of power 
during  we sold the majority of our solar modules to solar power system project developers  system integrators  and operators headquartered in germany  france  india  italy  and the united states  which either resell our solar modules to end users or integrate them into power plants that they own  operate  or sell 
as of december   we had supply contracts for the sale of solar modules with thirteen solar power system project developers and system integrators headquartered within the european union expiring at the end of supply contracts 
our sales prices under the supply contracts are primarily denominated in euros  exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations 
during the year ended december   of our components business net sales were denominated in euros and were subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and us dollar 
in the past  we have amended pricing  volume  and other terms in our supply contracts on a prospective basis in order to remain competitive  and we may decide in the future to further amend these contracts in order to address the highly competitive environment for solar modules 
effective september   the rebate program where we provided certain of our customers a price rebate for solar modules purchased from us  ended 
we have begun early stage discussions with our customers under current supply contracts regarding replacement contracts for periods covering and beyond  but such replacement contracts are not expected to be long term in nature 
for additional information regarding the rebate program  see note consolidated balance sheet details  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we also enter into one time module sales agreements with customers for specific projects 
under our customer contracts  we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment 
our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts 
during  the principal third party customers of our components business were edf en development and belectric 
during  each of these two customers individually accounted for more than of our components segment s net sales 
each of our other customers individually accounted for less than of our net sales during systems business through our fully integrated systems business  we provide a complete solar power system solution using our solar modules  which may include project development  epc services  o m services  when applicable  and project finance  when required 
net sales from our systems segment may include the following types of transactions transaction description engineer and procure ep contract design for a customer of a solar electricity generation system that uses our solar modules  includes the procurement of all bos components from third party suppliers 
engineer  procure  and construct epc contract design and construction for a customer of a turn key solar electricity generation system that uses our solar modules  includes the procurement of all bos components from third party suppliers 
sale of project assets sale of project assets to a customer at various stages of development 
this generally includes a single project consisting of costs incurred for permits  land or land rights  and or power off take agreements 
operating and maintenance o m agreement typically a fixed price long term services agreement 
net sales from our systems segment are impacted by numerous factors  including the magnitude and effectiveness of renewable portfolio standards  economic incentives  the competitiveness of our systems offering in comparison to our competitors solar systems and other forms of electricity generation and other pv system demand drivers 
during  the majority of our systems business sales were generated in north america 
net sales from our systems business during resulted primarily from revenue recognition for utility scale solar power projects in north america and europe 
during  net sales from our systems business resulted primarily from the sale of two utility scale solar power systems in the fourth fiscal quarter to utilities in the united states and canada 
we recognize revenue for arrangements entered into by the systems business generally using two revenue recognition models  following the guidance in asc  accounting for long term construction contracts or  for arrangements which include land or land rights  asc  accounting for sales of real estate 
for construction contracts that do not include land or land rights and thus are accounted for under asc  we use the percentage of completion method using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to complete a project including module costs as our basic accounting policy  unless we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates of the costs to complete the contract  in which case we would use the completed contract method 
we periodically revise our contract cost and profit estimates and we immediately recognize any losses that we identify on such contracts 
incurred costs include all direct materials  costs for solar modules  labor  subcontractor costs  and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  and tools 
we recognize direct material costs and costs for solar modules as incurred costs when the direct materials and solar modules have been installed 
when construction contracts or other agreements specify that title to direct materials and solar modules transfers to the customer before installation has been performed  we defer revenue and associated costs and recognize revenue once those materials are installed and have met all other revenue recognition requirements 
we consider direct materials to be installed when they are permanently attached or fitted to the solar power systems as required by engineering designs 
for arrangements recognized under asc  typically when we have gained control of land or land rights  we record the sale as revenue using one of the following revenue recognition methods  based upon the substance and the terms and conditions of such arrangements we apply the percentage of completion method to certain arrangements covered under asc  when the sale has been consummated  when we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer  the initial or continuing investment criteria have been met  we have the ability to estimate our costs and progress toward completion  and other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
depending on the value of the initial and continuing payment commitment by the buyer  we may align our revenue recognition and release of project assets to cost of sales with the receipt of payment from the buyer for sales arrangements accounted for under asc we record revenue for certain other arrangements covered under asc after construction of a project is complete  we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer  and we have received payment from the buyer 
the below tables summarize  as of february   our gw ac utility systems advanced project pipeline 
as of december   for such pipeline  we have recognized revenue with respect to the equivalent of approximately mw ac 
such amount refers to the total cumulative revenue recognized with respect to projects in our pipeline  divided by total contracted revenue for such projects multiplied by the total mw ac for such projects

epc contract or partner developed project uog utility owned generation opa ontario power authority resop program cost of sales components business our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules  such as tempered back glass  transparent conductive oxide coated front glass  cadmium telluride  laminate  connector assemblies  laminate edge seal  and other items 
our cost of sales also includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering  equipment maintenance  environmental health and safety  quality and production control  and procurement costs 
cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment and facility related expenses 
in addition  we accrue warranty and solar module collection and recycling costs to our cost of sales 
overall  we expect our cost of sales per watt to continue to decrease over the next several years due to an increase in sellable watts per solar module  an increase in unit output per production line  and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale 
this expected decrease in cost per watt would be partially offset during periods in which we underutilize manufacturing capacity 
systems business within our systems business  project related costs include standard epc costs consisting primarily of bos costs for inverters  electrical and mounting hardware  project management and engineering costs  and installation labor costs  site specific costs  and development costs including transmission upgrade costs  interconnection fees  and permitting costs 
as further described in note segment and geographical information  to our consolidated financial statements included within this annual report on form k  at the time when all revenue recognition criteria are met  we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business excluding inter company profit as net sales of our components business 
therefore  the related cost of sales are also included within our components business at that time 
deferred project costs represent i costs that we capitalize for arrangements that we account for as real estate transactions after we have entered into a definitive sales arrangement  but before we have met all criteria to recognize the sale as revenue  ii recoverable pre contract costs that we capitalize for arrangements accounted for as long term construction contracts prior to entering into a definitive sales agreement  or iii costs that we capitalize for arrangements accounted for as long term construction contracts after we have signed a definitive sales agreement  but before all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
as of december   deferred project costs capitalized on our balance sheet were million  of which  million was classified as current and million was classified as noncurrent 
as of december   our deferred project costs were million  all of which was classified as current 
gross profit gross profit is affected by numerous factors  including our module average selling prices  foreign exchange rates  the existence and effectiveness of subsidies and other economic incentives  competitive pressures  market demand  market mix  our manufacturing costs  bos costs  project development costs  the effective utilization of our production facilities  and the ramp of production on new plants due to a reduced ability to absorb fixed costs until full production volumes are reached 
gross profit is also subject to competitive pressures  most notably pressures resulting from declines in industry average selling prices 
gross profit margin is also affected by the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses 
our systems business generally operates at a lower gross profit margin due to the pass through nature of certain bos components procured from third parties 
gross profit for our systems business excludes the sales and cost of sales for solar modules  which we include in the gross profit of our components business 
research and development research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs  the cost of products  materials  and outside services used in our process  and product research and development activities 
we acquire equipment for general use in further process developments and record the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense 
currently  the majority of our research and development expenses are attributable to our components segment 
see note restructuring and acquisitions  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and pv systems using our modules 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  professional fees  insurance costs  travel expenses  and other selling expenses 
we expect selling expenses to increase in the near term in order to support the planned growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts 
over time  we expect selling  general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales as our net sales increase 
our systems business has certain of its own dedicated administrative key functions  such as accounting  legal  finance  project finance  human resources  procurement  and marketing 
costs for such functions are recorded and included within selling  general and administrative costs for our systems segment 
our corporate key functions consist primarily of company wide corporate tax  corporate treasury  corporate accounting finance  corporate legal  investor relations  corporate communications  and executive management functions 
based primarily on the significant growth of the systems business  we have concluded the corporate functions benefit both the components and systems segments 
we allocate corporate costs to the components or systems segment as part of selling  general and administrative costs  based upon the estimated benefits to each segment from the corporate functions 
production start up production start up expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production  including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase 
it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs  and the costs to maintain our plant replication program  to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures 
we incurred production start up expense of million during the year ended december  related to plant four of our malaysian manufacturing center and our ohio plant expansion 
we incurred production start up expense of million during the year ended december  related to our eight line malaysian  four line german  one line ohio  and two line france manufacturing expansions  including legal  regulatory  and personnel costs 
production start up expense for the year ended december  was million related to our eight line malaysian  four line german  two line france  four line vietnam and four line arizona manufacturing expansions  including legal  regulatory  and personnel costs 
in general  we expect production start up expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility  primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility 
production start up expense is attributable to our components segment 
the balancing of our production capabilities with market demand is a core component of our manufacturing capacity expansion strategy and our long term strategic plan 
to that end in february we decided not to proceed with our previously announced line plant in vietnam 
see note restructuring and acquisitions  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we have also postponed the commissioning of our previously announced line plant in mesa  arizona and the construction of our previously announced line plant in france until such time as global supply and demand dynamics support the additional manufacturing capacity in those geographic areas 
goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of  we determined that goodwill related to our components segment was impaired and recorded expense of million 
restructuring in december  executive management approved a set of restructuring initiatives intended to accelerate operating cost reductions and improve overall operating efficiency 
in connection with these restructuring initiatives  we incurred total charges of million in the fourth quarter of and we expect to incur an additional million in related to such restructuring initiatives 
these charges consisted primarily of i million of asset impairment and related charges due to a significant reduction in certain research and development activities that had been focused on an alternative pv product  and ii million in severance benefits to terminated employees as described below  most of which is expected to be paid out by the end of we are refocusing our research and development center in santa clara  california on the development of advanced cdte pv technologies  compared to a broader research and development effort up until now 
we eliminated positions company wide as part of the restructuring initiatives 
in february  executive management completed an evaluation of and approved a set of manufacturing capacity and other initiatives primarily intended to adjust our previously planned manufacturing capacity expansions and global manufacturing footprint 
the primary goal of these initiatives is to better align production capacity and geographic location of such capacity with expected geographic market requirements and demand 
in connection with these initiatives  we expect to incur total charges to operating expense of up to million during the first half of and up to million in total by the time such initiatives are complete  which is expected to be by the end of these expected charges consist primarily of i between million to million of asset impairment and related charges due to our decision in february not to proceed with our line manufacturing plant under construction in vietnam carrying value of million as of december   ii between million and million of asset impairment and related charges due to our decision in february to cease the use of certain manufacturing machinery and equipment intended for use in the production of certain components of our solar modules carrying value of million as of december   and iii between million to million of asset impairment and related charges primarily due to our decision in february to cease use of certain other long lived assets carrying value of million as of december  
based upon expected future market demand and our focus on providing utility scale pv generation solutions primarily to sustainable geographic markets  we have decided not to proceed with our previously announced line plant in vietnam 
we expect to actively market the plant for sale after all necessary construction has been completed  which is currently expected to occur in the first half of once certain criteria are met including the completion of all necessary construction activities and active marketing of the vietnam plant  we expect to meet the held for sale criteria  at which time we expect to record an impairment charge based primarily upon the then current fair value of the vietnam plant 
foreign currency gain loss foreign currency gain loss consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 
interest income interest income is earned on our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  and restricted cash and investments 
interest income also includes interest received from notes receivable and interest collected for late customer payments 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  is incurred on various debt financings 
we capitalize interest expense into our property  plant and equipment  project assets  and deferred project costs when such costs qualify for interest capitalization 
income tax expense income taxes are imposed on our income by taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate  principally the united states  germany  and malaysia 
the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the united states is  while the tax rates in germany and malaysia are approximately and  respectively 
in malaysia  we have been granted a long term tax holiday  scheduled to expire in  pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto 
some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience  our forecasts  and other available information  as appropriate 
our significant accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
our critical accounting estimates  which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  are as follows revenue recognition percentage of completion method 
we recognize revenue for arrangements entered into by the systems business generally using two revenue recognition models  following the guidance in asc  accounting for long term construction contracts or  for arrangements which include land or land rights  asc  accounting for sales of real estate 
we use the percentage of completion method using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to complete a project including module costs for our construction contracts that do not include land or land rights and thus are accounted for under asc  as our basic accounting policy  unless we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates of the costs to complete the contract  in which case we would use the completed contract method 
we periodically revise our contract cost and profit estimates and we immediately recognize any losses that we identify on such contracts 
such estimates include significant judgment 
incurred costs include all direct materials  costs for solar modules  labor  subcontractor costs  and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  and tools 
we recognize direct material costs and costs for solar modules as incurred costs when the direct materials and solar modules have been installed 
when construction contracts or other agreements specify that title to direct materials and solar modules transfers to the customer before installation has been performed  we defer revenue and associated costs and recognize revenue once those materials are installed and have met all other revenue recognition requirements 
we consider direct materials to be installed when they are permanently attached or fitted to the solar power systems as required by engineering designs 
we also apply the percentage of completion method to certain arrangements covered under asc  when the sale has been consummated  when we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer  the initial or continuing investment criteria have been met  we have the ability to estimate our costs and progress toward completion  and other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
such estimates include significant judgment 
depending on the value of the initial and continuing payment commitment by the buyer  we may align our revenue recognition and release of project assets to cost of sales with the receipt of payment from the buyer for sales arrangements accounted for under asc accrued solar module collection and recycling liability 
at the time of sale  we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for collecting and recycling the solar modules that we have sold when they have reached the end of their useful lives 
we base our estimate of the fair value of our collection and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected probability weighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules  which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport  the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center  the material  labor  and capital costs of the recycling process  and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services 
we base this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes  about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled  and about the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling 
in the periods between the time of our sales and our settlement of the collection and recycling obligations  we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed an annual cost study and updated our estimates for the expected future recycling costs 
as a result  we adjusted our module collection and recycling liability accordingly 
at december   our estimate of the fair value of our liability for collecting and recycling solar modules was million 
a decrease in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would reduce this estimated liability by million  to million  a increase in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would increase this estimated liability by million  to million 
product warranties and manufacturing excursion 
we have historically provided a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules 
for solar module sales made subsequent to september   we have increased the limited warranty we provide against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions from years to years 
we also warrant to the owners of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreed upon specifications will produce at least of their power output rating during the first years following their installation and at least of their power output rating during the following years 
in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties  we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar module or  under the power output warranty  providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall 
for modules sold after september   we also have the option to make a payment for the then current market module price to resolve claims 
our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of our solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale 
when we recognize revenue for module sales  we accrue a liability for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations for those modules 
we make and revise this estimate based on the number of our solar modules under warranty at customer locations  our historical experience with warranty claims  our monitoring of field installation sites  our in house testing of and the expected future performance of our solar modules  and our estimated per module replacement cost 
such estimates have changed  and may in the future change  based primarily upon additional information received from completed voluntary remediation efforts at certain sites and from the evaluation of information available after completion of the analysis on certain outstanding claims 
such additional information provides further understanding of  and additional data regarding  the number of replacement modules expected to be required in connection with our voluntary remediation efforts 
we must also make an estimate for the cost of the remediation program described further in manufacturing excursion 
our estimates for the remediation program have changed  and may in the future change  significantly in light of our ongoing remediation efforts and our continued analysis of remaining claims 
in the fourth quarter of  we processed approximately of the claims related to the manufacturing excursion that we received 
in light of the additional data we gained from processed claims  as well as experience from our remediation efforts  our estimates have been subject to change 
our estimate for such remediation costs is based on evaluation and consideration of currently available information  including the estimated number of affected modules in the field  historical experience related to our remediation efforts  customer provided data related to potentially affected systems  the estimated costs of performing the removal  replacement and logistical services  and the post sale expenses covered under our remediation program 
accounting for income taxes 
we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states  and its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities 
we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
we regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations  and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 
we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes that may arise out of tax audits in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic asc  income taxes 
once established  we adjust the liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a legal claim  tax assessment  or regulatory fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities  if any 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net noncurrent amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period  we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
conversely  to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary  that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed  which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 
we also consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
we have concluded that  except for the earnings of our canadian subsidiary and with respect to previously taxed income  all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested 
accordingly  no additional taxes have been accrued that might be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the united states 
if our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes  additional taxes may be required to be accrued 
see note income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information 
long lived asset impairment 
we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified 
we review our long lived assets each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
for long lived assets  when impairment indicators are present  we compare undiscounted future cash flows  including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value  to the asset group s carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable 
this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used 
assessments also consider changes in asset group utilization  including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing of placing this capacity back into production 
for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above  the estimated fair value of long lived assets may be determined using an income approach  market approach  cost approach  or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed 
all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long lived assets 
if there is an impairment  a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the asset groups fair value and carrying value 
this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values applied in the income approach used in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 
our estimates are based upon our historical experience  our commercial relationships  and available information about future trends 
we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market changes and the corresponding impact on volume and average selling prices and that these are more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions 
we believe our current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we do not amortize goodwill  but instead are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and  if necessary  we would record any impairment in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
we will perform an impairment test between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value 
we may first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the qualitative impairment test includes considering various factors including macroeconomic conditions  industry and market conditions  cost factors  a sustained share price or market capitalization decrease  and any reporting unit specific events 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value  the two step impairment test is not required 
if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is not greater than its carrying value  we must perform the two step impairment test 
we may also elect to proceed directly to the two step impairment test without considering such qualitative factors 
the first step in a two step impairment test is the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
our two reporting units are the components and systems reporting units  which are the same as our reportable segments as described in note segment and geographical information  to our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance over fair value measurements  we define the fair value of a reporting unit as the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation  which includes the discounted cash flow method  and the market approach methodology of valuation  which considers values of comparable businesses to estimate the fair values of our reporting units 
we do not believe that a cost approach is relevant to measuring the fair values of our reporting units 
significant management judgment is required when estimating the fair value of our reporting units including the forecasting of future operating results  the discount rates and expected future growth rates that we use in the discounted cash flow method of valuation  and in the selection of comparable businesses that we use in the market approach 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required 
if the carrying value assigned to a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value in the first step  then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test 
in this step  we assign the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit  as if a market participant just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in the first step of the impairment test over the total amount assigned to the assets and liabilities in the second step of the impairment test represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
if there is no such excess then all goodwill for a reporting unit is considered impaired 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined through a two step goodwill impairment test that the million in goodwill for our components reporting unit was fully impaired as discussed further in note goodwill and intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k

gross profit years ended year over dollars in thousands year change gross profit of net sales gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by percentage points in compared with this decrease was attributable to the following a percentage point reduction due to a decline in our module asp  a percentage point reduction relating to voluntary remediation efforts for affected module removal  replacement and logistical services related to the manufacturing excursion discussed in item manufacturing excursion in this annual report on form k  a percentage point reduction due to an increase in the expected number of required replacement modules for such excursion related remediation efforts  a percentage point reduction due to an increase in expected warranty claims for potential module performance in certain climates  and a percentage point reduction due to inventory write downs 
these decreases were partially offset by a percentage point increase attributable to continued manufacturing scale and reductions in our manufacturing cost per watt  a percentage point increase due to segment mix between our components and systems businesses  and a percentage point increase due to the weakening of the euro against the us dollar exchange rate 
we expect that gross profit will continue to be impacted in future periods by the product mix between our components and systems businesses 
research and development years ended year over dollars in thousands year change research and development of net sales the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to a million increase in personnel related expenses including a million increase in share based compensation expense resulting from hiring for increased investment in various research and development projects  a million increase in testing and qualification material cost  and a million increase in facilities and utilities expenses

goodwill impairment years ended year over dollars in thousands year change goodwill impairment of net sales as of december   the million in goodwill related to our components reporting unit primarily represented goodwill originally allocated from the acquisitions of optisolar in and nextlight in the allocation of substantially all the goodwill from these acquisitions to our components reporting unit represented the expected synergies  economies of scale and vertical integration our components business would realize from using our solar modules in the project pipelines obtained from these acquisitions 
the goodwill allocation to our components business was consistent with our historical view that the systems business functioned as an enabler for the components business to drive module throughput 
once goodwill has been assigned to a reporting unit  for accounting purposes  the goodwill is no longer associated with the underlying acquisitions that the goodwill originated from 
we determined the implied fair value of goodwill in the components reporting unit to be zero as of december  as a result  we impaired all of the goodwill in the components reporting unit and recorded million of impairment expense

fiscal years ended december  and december  net sales years ended year over dollars in thousands year change net sales the increase in net sales was primarily driven by strong demand from german customers in advance of further fit reductions  an increase in revenue from our systems business  and an increase in production volume  resulting in a increase in megawatts sold during compared with these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our module asp 
the increase in megawatts sold was attributable to the full production ramp of our four plant malaysian manufacturing center in  full production ramp of our perrysburg  ohio expansion in  continued improvements to our manufacturing process and line throughput  and growth in our systems business 
in addition  we increased the average conversion efficiency of our modules by approximately during compared with our module asp  excluding the impact of systems segment break even reporting  decreased by approximately during compared with the decline in our module average selling price was attributable to the following a decrease due to market price declines driven by fit reductions in europe  a decrease due to annual contractual agreements  and a decrease due to the weakening of the euro against the us dollar exchange rate  partially offset by a increase due to a shift in customer mix 
revenue recognized by our systems business during was million and resulted primarily from the sale of utility scale solar power systems in europe and north america and from percentage of completion revenue recognition for utility scale solar power systems in north america 
during and  and  respectively  of our net sales resulted from solar module sales to customers headquartered in germany 
cost of sales years ended year over dollars in thousands year change cost of sales of net sales the increase in cost of sales was due to higher sales volumes  including an increase in the completion and sale of utility scale solar power projects by our systems business  the full production ramp of our first four plants at our malaysian manufacturing center in  and the full production ramp of our perrysburg  ohio expansion in the increased production and sales volumes in our components business and increased volume sold through our systems business had the following effects a million increase in direct material expense  a million increase in manufacturing overhead costs  an million increase in sales freight  a million increase in warranty expense  and a million net increase in other costs 
the million increase in manufacturing overhead costs for was due to a million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses including a million increase in share based compensation expense  a million increase in depreciation and equipment expenses  a million increase in facility related expenses  and a million increase in incremental systems costs 
each of these manufacturing overhead cost increases primarily resulted from increased production capacity resulting from the full ramp of our malaysian manufacturing center  expansion of our perrysburg  ohio plant  and ramp of our systems business 
the net increase in other costs for includes million related to an increase in estimated expenses for certain module replacement efforts beyond normal warranty related to the manufacturing excursion described above under manufacturing excursion 
accordingly  we accrued additional expenses of million in and million in total to date to cover the replacement of the anticipated affected module population in the field 
such amounts include million in expenses accrued during the fourth fiscal quarter of  reflecting updated best estimates of the total replacement costs  based on our field data and execution to date of the module replacement program 
our average manufacturing cost per watt declined by per watt  or  from in to in and included of non cash stock based compensation 
gross profit years ended year over dollars in thousands year change gross profit of net sales gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by percentage points in compared with this decrease was attributable to the following a percentage point reduction due to a decline in our module asp  a percentage point reduction due to segment mix between our components and systems businesses  a percentage point reduction relating to the manufacturing excursion discussed above under manufacturing excursion  and a percentage point reduction due to the weakening of the euro against the us dollar exchange rate  partially offset by a percentage point margin improvement attributable to continued manufacturing scale and reductions in our manufacturing cost per watt 
we expect that gross profit will be impacted in future periods by the volatility of the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro and product mix between our components and systems businesses 
research and development years ended year over dollars in thousands year change research and development of net sales the increase in research and development expense was due to a million increase in personnel related expenses including a million increase in share based compensation expense resulting from increased headcount devoted to working on various projects to increase the efficiency of our modules at converting sunlight into electricity  and a million increase in depreciation  testing  and qualification material costs  partially offset by a million decrease in other expenses

business segment review years ended year year years ended year year dollars in thousands change change net sales components systems total loss income before income taxes segment profit components systems total our chief operating decision maker codm  consisting of certain members of senior executive staff  has viewed the manufacturing and sale of solar modules from the components segment as the core driver of our resource allocation  profitability  and cash throughput 
all sales or service offerings from our systems segment are for pv solar power systems that use our solar modules  which are designed and manufactured by our components segment 
as a result  we have viewed our systems segment as an enabler to drive module throughput 
our systems segment enables solar module throughput by developing state of the art construction techniques and process management to reduce the installed cost of our pv systems and  accordingly  this business was not intended to generate profits that are independent of the underlying solar modules sold with such systems segment service offerings 
therefore  for the fiscal years  and  our codm viewed the primary objective of our systems segment to be achieving break even results before income taxes 
we include all sales of our solar modules manufactured by our components segment and installed in projects sold by our systems segment in net sales of our components business

our module asp  excluding the impact of systems segment break even reporting  decreased by approximately during compared with the decline in our module asp was attributable to a decrease of our non systems module asp due to competitive pressures and geographic mix 
the decrease was partially offset by a increase of our systems module asp driven primarily by the mix of systems projects recognized in revenue 
the effect of our segment reporting adjustments  to achieve break even results before income taxes for our systems segment  decreased the module average selling price by an additional components segment net sales increased by during compared with  primarily driven by price elasticity that resulted in strong demand for our solar modules as prices declined  increased net sales attributable to modules installed in utility scale solar power systems for which we have recognized revenue  an increase in production volume as a result of bringing additional manufacturing lines into full production  and continued improvements to our manufacturing process 
components segment cost of sales increased by during compared with  and by during compared with  primarily due to higher production and sales volumes 
in addition  cost of sales increased in compared to due to increased expense from voluntary remediation efforts related to the manufacturing excursion costs discussed above under manufacturing excursion 
components segment profit decreased by during compared with  primarily due to goodwill impairment  lower average selling price  and higher costs resulting from the manufacturing excursion and related remediation program discussed above under manufacturing excursion  partially offset by an increase in the mw volume of solar modules sold 
components segment profit increased by during compared with  primarily due to an increase in the mw volume of solar modules sold  reductions in our manufacturing cost per watt  and by increased throughput  partially offset by a decline in our module average selling price and certain manufacturing excursion and warranty related expenses

product revenue the following table sets forth the total amounts of solar modules and solar power systems revenue recognized for the years ended december   december   and december  for the purposes of the following table  a solar module revenue is composed of total revenues from the sale of solar modules to third parties  and b solar power systems revenue is composed of total revenues from the sale of complete solar power systems and related services including the solar modules installed in the solar power systems 
dollars in thousands solar module revenue solar power system revenue net sales liquidity and capital resources we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash flows from operating activities  revolving credit facility  and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we intend to continue to carefully execute our long term strategic plan and manage credit and market risk 
however  if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions  we may not have sufficient resources to support the execution of our long term strategic plan 
cash generated from operations is our primary source of operating liquidity and we believe that internally generated cash flows combined with our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and availability under our revolving credit facility are sufficient to support day to day business operations 
our treasury department monitors the efficiency of our balance sheet to ensure we have adequate liquidity  both domestically and internationally  to support the execution of our long term strategic plan 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  compared with  million as of december  as of december  and december   million and million  respectively  of our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in euros and us dollar denominated holdings 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations  the overall cost of capital  and cash requirements for operations  capital expenditures and discretionary strategic spending 
we believe that when necessary  we will have adequate access to capital markets  although our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient investor interest due to industry wide or company specific concerns 
we have an active shelf registration statement filed with the sec for the issuance of debt or equity securities if needed 
our expanding systems business required increased liquidity in and is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future 
solar power project development cycles  which span the time between the identification of a site location to the commercial operation of a pv power plant  vary substantially and can take many years to mature 
as a result of these long project cycles  we may need to make significant up front investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash flows from the sale of or payments for such systems projects 
these amounts include payment of interconnection and other deposits some of which are non refundable  posting of letters of credit  and incurring engineering  permitting  legal  and other expenses 
additionally  we may have to use our working capital or the availability under our revolving credit facility to finance the construction of our systems projects  if such projects cannot be sold before construction begins 
depending upon the size and number of projects that we are developing and self financing the construction of  the systems business may require significant liquidity 
for example  we may have to substantially complete the construction of a systems project before such project is sold 
we have historically financed these up front investments for project development and when necessary  construction  primarily using working capital 
in the future  we may also engage in one or more debt or equity financings 
such financings could result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms  we may be unable to execute our long term strategic plan 
the following significant developments in have impacted or are expected to impact our liquidity on may   in connection with the plant expansion at our german manufacturing center  fsm gmbh  our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a credit facility agreement german facility agreement  which consisted of the following balances as of december  in thousands borrowings outstanding availability interest rate maturity denomination original capacity december  december  euribor plus eur see also note debt  and note restricted cash and investments  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further information about this facility

during  we made significant capital expenditures related to the construction of manufacturing plants in vietnam and mesa  arizona including expenditures for machinery and equipment for eight manufacturing lines 
in february we decided to not proceed with our previously announced line plant in vietnam 
see note restructuring and acquisitions  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we have also postponed the commissioning of our previously announced line plant in mesa  arizona until global supply and demand dynamics support the additional manufacturing capacity 
we expect to continue to make any necessary capital expenditures for these locations during to continue any necessary construction and to acquire the underlying machinery and equipment 
taking into account our expected restructuring and impairment charges  and potential additional future charges as we seek to align our manufacturing production with market demand  we could in the future incur significant additional restructuring costs including potentially the repayment of debt facilities and other amounts  the payment of severance to terminated employees  and other costs that could substantially reduce our liquidity position to the point where we need to pursue additional sources of financing  assuming such sources are available to us 
during  the amount of unbilled a r increased to million and represents revenues recognized on the construction of systems projects in advance of billing the customer under the terms of the underlying construction contracts 
such unbilled a r represents construction we have funded with working capital and such amounts are expected to be billed and collected from customers during the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets that began in and the current instability in the euro zone have had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions 
the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in europe and its impact on the balance sheets and lending practices of european banks in particular could negatively impact our access to  and cost of  capital  and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and competitive position 
it could also similarly affect our customers and therefore limit the sales of our modules and demand for our systems business as well 
as of december   our liquidity and investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future 
we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment 
cash flows the following table summarizes the key cash flow metrics for the years ended december   december   and december  in thousands years ended net cash used in provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash used by operating activities was million during  compared with cash provided by operating activities of million during and million during the decrease in operating cash flows during was primarily due to the difference between net cash received from customers and net cash paid to suppliers being significantly less than in and this disparity was primarily the result of an increase in accounts receivable  unbilled  which represents revenue that has been recognized in advance of billing the customer 
this is common for construction contracts 
although such construction work did not result in cash received from customers  the underlying cost of construction activities resulted in cash paid to suppliers creating a timing difference for cash flows from operating activities 
accounts receivable  unbilled as of december  is expected to be billed and collected within the next months 
another significant driver of the decrease was the increase from in inventories and bos parts  which resulted in an increase in cash paid to suppliers  but as such inventories and bos parts were not yet sold  there was no corresponding cash received from customers 
the remaining decrease in cash provided by operating activities was the result of net differences in excess tax benefits from share based compensation arrangements  income taxes paid  interest received and interest paid in compared to and investing activities cash used in investing activities was million during  compared with million during and million during the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of less acquisition activity in compared to  and a larger net inflow from sales  maturities  and purchases of marketable securities in than in and those increases were primarily offset by more capital expenditures during compared to and due to completion of two new plants in malaysia  completion of expansions in frankfurt oder germany and perrysburg  ohio  and construction of new plants in vietnam and mesa  arizona 
during  we made significant capital expenditures related to the construction of manufacturing plants in vietnam and mesa  arizona including expenditures for machinery and equipment for eight manufacturing lines 
the balancing of our production capabilities with market demand is a core component of our manufacturing capacity expansion strategy and our long term strategic plan 
as discussed above  we will not construct our previously announced line plant in vietnam  and have indefinitely postponed the commissioning of our previously announced line plant in mesa  arizona and the construction of our previously announced line plant in france until global supply and demand dynamics support the additional manufacturing capacity 
although the timing for production from these plants is uncertain  we expect to continue to make any necessary capital expenditures for these capacity expansions during to continue construction and to acquire the underlying machinery and equipment 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million during compared with cash provided by financing activities of million during and cash used in financing of million during cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from proceeds of million from borrowings on our malaysian ringgit facility agreement  german facility agreement  and malaysian euro facility along with million of net proceeds from drawdowns on our revolving credit facility 
additionally  we recorded excess tax benefits from share based compensation arrangements of million and received cash from employee stock option exercises of million 
we used million of cash for the repayment of long term debt 
cash provided by financing activities during resulted primarily from proceeds received from draw downs on our revolving credit facility of million  excess tax benefits from share based compensation arrangements of million as described below  and by cash received from employee stock option exercises of million  partially offset by the repayment of long term debt of million 
during the year ended december   we realized million of excess tax benefits related to share based compensation arrangements from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards comprised of excess tax deductions primarily as a result of our decision to repatriate approximately million of earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
cash used in financing activities during resulted primarily from the repayment of long term debt of million  partially offset by draw downs on our prior malaysian facility agreement  net of issuance costs  of million related to the equipment export financing agreement for our malaysian manufacturing center 
proceeds from the issuance of employee stock options during were million 
excess tax benefits from share based compensation arrangements during were million 
contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december   which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments 
we purchase raw materials for inventory  services  and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors 
we also enter into construction contracts for the construction of new or expansion of existing manufacturing plants 
during the normal course of business  in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help assure adequate supply  we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements 
payments due by year contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations interest payments capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations recycling obligations other obligations total includes estimated cash interest to be paid over the remaining terms of the debt 
interest payments are based on fixed and floating rates in effect at december  and include the effect of interest rate swap agreements and cross currency swap agreements 
purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that are non cancellable  enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of transactions 
includes expected letter of credit fees  unused capacity fees for our revolving credit facility  and a debt surety guarantee fee for our german facility agreement 
in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  we have recorded million of unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with asc  income taxes  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
debt and credit sources as of december   we had million in outstanding long term debt  excluding amounts related to capital leases  and million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees

we have an active shelf registration statement filed with the sec for the issuance of debt or equity securities 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december   and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants for at least the next twelve months 
see note debt  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further information about our long term debt facilities 
capital expenditures we expect to spend up to million for capital expenditures during  including expenditures for machinery and equipment which we believe will increase our solar module efficiencies and the necessary expenditures to continue certain construction activities and to acquire the underlying machinery and equipment for our manufacturing plants in vietnam and mesa  arizona 
a majority of our capital expenditures for will be incurred in foreign currencies and are therefore subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  recent accounting pronouncements see note recent accounting pronouncements  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our primary foreign currency exposures are cash flow exposure  transaction exposure  and earnings translation exposure 
cash flow exposure we expect our subsidiaries to have material future cash flows  including revenues and expenses  that will be denominated in currencies other than the component s functional currency 
our primary cash flow exposures are cash received from customers and cash paid to suppliers and associates 
changes in the exchange rates between our components functional currencies and the other currencies in which they transact will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive or pay when these cash flows are realized or settled 
accordingly  we enter into foreign exchange forward or cross currency swap contracts to hedge the value of a portion of these forecasted cash flows 
these foreign exchange forward and cross currency swap contracts qualified as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging  and we designated them as such 
we initially report the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the underlying hedged transaction is settled 
most of our german plant s operating expenses are denominated in euros  creating natural hedges against the currency risk in our net sales 
during the first half of  we purchased foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of the exchange risk on forecasted cash flows denominated in euros 
our operations in malaysia pay a portion of their operating expenses  such as associate wages and utilities  in malaysian ringgit  exposing us to foreign currency exchange risk for those expenses 
for additional details on our hedging instruments and activities  refer to note derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our international operations accounted for   and of our net sales during the years ended december   december   and december   respectively  of which   and of these international sales  respectively  were denominated in euros 
as a result  we have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our net sales 
fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly in the us dollar to euro exchange rate and us dollar to malaysian ringgit  affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses 
in the past  most of our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the time we sign and settle our sales contracts denominated in euros 
for example  our supply contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the us dollar to euro exchange rate 
for the years ended december   december   and december   a change in the euro exchange rates would have impacted our net euro sales by million  million  and million  respectively  excluding the effect of our hedging activities 
our net sales denominated in euros are expected to continue to decline and therefore our foreign currency exchange risk associated with the euro is expected to also decline 
transaction exposure many components of our business have assets and liabilities primarily receivables  investments  accounts payable  debt  and solar module collection and recycling liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the component s functional currency 
changes in the exchange rates between our components functional currencies and the other currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated can create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivative instruments to economically hedge assets and liabilities against the short term effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the gains and losses on these derivative instruments will offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency assets and liabilities 
these contracts typically have maturities of less than three months 
for additional details on our economic hedging instruments and activities  refer to note derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
if the us dollar would have weakened by against the euro  malaysian ringgit  japanese yen  canadian dollar  and australian dollar  the impact on our income before income taxes during the year ended december  would have been million favorable 
if the us dollar would have weakened by against the euro  malaysian ringgit  japanese yen  and canadian dollar the impact on our income before income taxes during the years ended december  and december  would have been million unfavorable and million favorable  respectively 
earnings translation exposure fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to translate the financial statements of our subsidiaries that do not have a us dollar functional currency 
we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations 
these contracts would be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in earnings 
we do not hedge translation exposure at this time  but may do so in the future 
in the past  currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations 
for example  currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our cash flows by million  million  and million in the years ended december   december   and december   respectively 
although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations  we believe that we will continue to have risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future 
we will continue to evaluate actions we can take to use derivatives to help mitigate this risk 
interest rate risk our primary interest rate risks are our outstanding variable rate debt  our solar power system sales prices from the effect of interest rates on our customer s financing of such solar power systems  and our investments in debt securities 
variable rate debt exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk because our revolving credit facility  german facility agreement  malaysian ringgit facility agreement  malaysian euro facility agreement  and the floating rate portion of our malaysian facility agreement have variable interest rates  exposing us to variability in interest expense and cash flows 
we use interest rate swap contracts and cross currency swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with a portion of our variable rate debt instruments 
we have interest rate swap contracts in place to mitigate the interest rate risk for a portion our german facility agreement and the floating rate portion of our malaysian facility agreement 
we also have a cross currency swap contract in place to mitigate the interest rate risk of our malaysian ringgit facility agreement 
for additional details on our hedging instruments and activities  refer to note derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
an increase in the euro interbank offered rate euribor would impact our cost of borrowing under the unhedged portion of our german facility agreement and our entire malaysian euro facility agreement  and an increase in the london interbank offered rate libor would impact our cost of borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
if euribor increased or decreased by basis points  our interest cost for the year ended december  would have increased or decreased million  respectively 
if libor increased or decreased by basis points  our interest cost for the year ended december  would have increased or decreased million  respectively 
effect on customer s financing of solar power systems we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our systems business customers depend on debt and equity financing to purchase a solar power system from us 
although the useful life of a solar power system is considered to be approximately years  end users of our solar power systems must pay the entire cost of the solar power system by the time such system is completed 
as a result  many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their up front capital expenditures 
an increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our end users to secure the financing necessary to purchase a system 
this could lower demand or the price we can charge for our solar power systems and reduce our net sales 
in addition  we believe that a significant percentage of our end users install solar power systems as an investment  funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt 
an increase in interest rates could lower an investor s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems  which  in each case  could cause these end users to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 
investments in debt securities exposure we invest in debt securities  which exposes us to interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value of our investment may decline 
as of december   our marketable securities earned a pre tax yield of  with a weighted average maturity of months 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points  the market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease increase by million 
the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
as of december   all of our marketable securities were in commercial paper  corporate debt securities  federal and foreign agency debt  foreign government obligations  supranational debt  and us government obligations 
as of december   our restricted investments earned a pre tax yield of  with a weighted average maturity of approximately years 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points  the market value of our total restricted investment portfolio could decrease increase by million 
the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our restricted investment portfolio 
given that our restricted investment portfolio is intended to pre fund our estimated solar module collection and recycling costs  and given the expected holding period of these investments  we believe it is unlikely that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
as of december   all of our restricted investments were in foreign and us government obligations 
commodity and component risk we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials  components  and energy costs used in the manufacture and transportation of our solar modules and bos parts used in solar power systems 
also  some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier 
we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers using a robust qualification process 
in some cases  we also enter into long term supply contracts for raw materials and components 
as a result  we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules 
in addition  a failure by a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices and or a disruption in our manufacturing process 
we may be unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products and systems to our customers  and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing disruption 
credit risk we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk 
these consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  restricted investments  trade accounts receivable  interest rate swap contracts  cross currency swap contracts  and foreign exchange forward contracts 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments 
we place cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  restricted investments  interest rate swap contracts  cross currency contracts  and foreign exchange forward contracts with various high quality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty 
we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions 
in addition  we have certain investments in debt securities related to countries in the eurozone 
these investments are for debt securities of countries with a lower likelihood of experiencing significant economic  fiscal  and or political strains such that default or severe decreases in fair value would occur 
however  such risk cannot be eliminated and is reflected in the current fair value of the investments as of december
