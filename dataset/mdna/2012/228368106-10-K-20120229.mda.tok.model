executive overview the company s focus is to increase shareholder value by maximizing cash flow while investing in promising growth projects in emerging markets and generating sufficient returns which can be reinvested in the company to expand or improve its operations  used to pay down debt and or returned to shareholders 
the company s current growth projects include expansion in the emerging markets of brazil  china  and southeast asia 
when the current lineup of expansion projects is completed  the company expects to have added approximately billion units of incremental can capacity to its year end levels 
in the mature  developed markets of north america and western europe  the company continues to focus on improving productivity and efficiency while reducing material and resource use and waste 
the key performance measure used by the company is segment income  which is a non gaap measure 
segment income is defined by the company as gross profit less selling and administrative expenses 
improving segment income is primarily dependent on the company s ability to increase revenues and manage costs 
the company s key strategies for increasing revenues include investing in geographic markets with growth potential and developing innovative packaging products using proprietary technology 
the company s cost control efforts focus on improving operating efficiencies and managing material and labor costs  including pension and other benefit costs 
in addition  the company considers refinancing transactions aimed at reducing the company s leverage  as well as possible acquisitions which  if effected  may increase the company s indebtedness or involve the issuance of company securities  dispositions  investments or repurchases of its common stock 
such transactions would be subject to compliance with the company s debt agreements 
the company s revenues and costs are impacted by the cost of aluminum and steel  the primary raw materials used to manufacture the company s products  which have been subject to significant volatility in recent years 
the company attempts to pass through these costs to its customers either through provisions that adjust the selling prices to certain customers based on changes in the market price of the applicable raw material  or through surcharges where no such provision exists 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to fully recover from its customers the impact of any increased aluminum and steel costs 
in addition  if the company is unable to purchase steel or aluminum for a significant period of time  its operations would be disrupted

inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company over the past three years and the company does not expect it to have a significant impact on the results of operations or financial condition in the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require that management make numerous estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions  impacting the reported results of operations and financial position of the company 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described under note a to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies  however  are considered to be critical in that i they are most important to the depiction of the company s financial condition and results of operations and ii their application requires management s most subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
asbestos liabilities the company s potential liability for asbestos cases is highly uncertain due to the difficulty of forecasting many factors  including the level of future claims  the rate of receipt of claims  the jurisdiction in which claims are filed  the nature of future claims including the seriousness of alleged disease  whether claimants allege first exposure to asbestos before or during and the alleged link to crown cork  the terms of settlements of other defendants with asbestos related liabilities  the bankruptcy filings of other defendants which may result in additional claims and higher settlement demands for non bankrupt defendants  potential liabilities for claims filed after the company s ten year projection period and the effect of state asbestos legislation including the validity and applicability of the pennsylvania legislation to non pennsylvania jurisdictions  where the substantial majority of the company s asbestos cases are filed 
see note k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the provision for asbestos related costs 
at the end of each quarter  the company considers whether there have been any material developments that would cause it to update its asbestos accrual calculations 
absent any significant developments in the asbestos litigation environment in general or with respect to the company specifically  the company updates its accrual calculations in the fourth quarter of each year 
the company s asbestos accrual is an estimate of the amounts expected to be paid over the next ten years including outstanding claims  projected future claims and legal costs 
outstanding claims used in the accrual calculation are adjusted for factors such as claims filed in those states where the company s liability is limited by statute and claims alleging first exposure to asbestos after which are assumed to have no value and claims that have been outstanding for a significant length of time which are assumed to have a nominal value 
projected future claims are calculated based on actual data for the most recent five years 
outstanding and projected claims are multiplied by the average settlement cost of those claims for the most recent five years 

table of contents crown holdings  inc the five year average settlement cost per claim was   and  for  and  respectively 
the average settlement cost per claim increased due to a higher percentage of claims in crown cork s settlement pool for claims alleging serious disease primarily mesothelioma and other malignancies during the most recent five year period 
of the approximately  claims outstanding at the end of  and approximately  and respectively  relate to claims alleging serious diseases 
of the approximately  claims related to claimants alleging first exposure to asbestos before or during that were filed in states that have not enacted asbestos legislation and were outstanding at the end of  and approximately  and respectively  relate to claims alleging serious diseases 
as claims are not submitted or settled evenly throughout the year  it is difficult to predict at any time during the year whether the number of claims or average settlement cost over the five year period ending december of such year will increase compared to the prior five year period 
because the company s asbestos liability is an estimate of the amounts expected to be paid over the next ten years  the company expects to record a charge each year to account for projected claims in the new tenth year 
in  the company recorded a charge of primarily due to the impact of including an additional year of settlement and legal costs in its projection period and the impact of valuing outstanding and projected claims at higher average settlement amounts 
in  the company recorded a charge of including to increase its accrual for asbestos related costs in texas as described in note k to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the company recorded a charge of during  and  the company made asbestos related payments of  and  respectively 
if the recent trend of settling a higher percentage of claims alleging serious disease primarily mesothelioma and other malignancies which are settled for higher amounts continues  average settlement costs per claim are likely to increase and  if not offset by a reduction in overall claims and settlements  the company may record additional charges in the future 
a change in either the average cost per claim or the number of projected claims would increase or decrease the estimated liability at december  by for the following ten year period 
a increase or decrease in these two factors at the same time would increase or decrease the estimated liability at december  by and  respectively  for the following ten year period 
goodwill impairment the company performs a goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year or when facts and circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired 
in  the company early adopted the accounting guidance which provides the option of first performing a qualitative assessment on none  some  or all of the company s reporting units to determine whether further quantitative impairment testing is necessary 
a company may also bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test 
the company completed its annual review and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary 
although no goodwill impairment was recorded  there can be no assurances that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
the quantitative impairment test involves a number of assumptions and judgments  including the calculation of fair value for the company s identified reporting units 
the company determines the estimated fair value for each reporting unit based on the average of the estimated fair values calculated using market values for comparable businesses and discounted cash flow projections 
the company uses an average of the two methods in estimating fair value because it believes they provide an equal probability of yielding an appropriate fair value for the reporting unit 
the company s estimates of future cash flows include assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions and may differ from actual future cash flows 
under the first method of calculating estimated fair value  the company obtains publicly available trading multiples based on the enterprise value of companies in the packaging industry whose shares are publicly traded 
the company also reviews available information regarding the multiples used in recent transactions  if any  involving transfers of controlling interests in the packaging industry 
the appropriate multiple is applied to the forecasted adjusted ebitda a non gaap item defined by the company as net customer sales  less cost of products sold excluding depreciation and amortization  less selling and administrative expenses of the reporting unit to obtain an estimated fair value 
under the second method  fair value is calculated as the sum of the projected 
table of contents crown holdings  inc discounted cash flows of the reporting unit over the next five years and the terminal value at the end of those five years 
the projected cash flows generally include no growth assumption unless there has recently been a material change in the business or a material change is forecasted 
the discount rate used is based on the average weighted average cost of capital of companies in the packaging industry  which information is available through various sources 
the terminal value at the end of the five years is the product of the forecasted adjusted ebitda at the end of the five year period and the trading multiple 
the company used an ebitda multiple of times and a discount rate of in its review 
the assumed ebitda multiple was consistent with the times used in the discount rate in decreased from the used in due to a decrease in the weighted average cost of capital of companies in the packaging industry 
based upon the company s qualitative and quantitative assessment including consideration of the sensitivity of the assumptions made and methods used to determine fair value  industry trends and other relevant factors  the company did not have any reporting unit at the end of whose fair value did not materially exceed its carrying value except for its european aerosols reporting unit 
as of december   the estimated fair value of the european aerosols reporting unit was higher than its carrying value  and the reporting unit had of goodwill 
the fair value of the european aerosols reporting unit was estimated using the methods and assumptions described above 
the maximum potential effect of weighting the two methods other than equally would have been to increase or decrease the estimated fair value at december  by assuming all other factors remain the same  a change in forecasted annual adjusted ebitda changes the excess of estimated fair value over carrying value by  a change of in the assumed ebitda multiple changes the excess of estimated fair value over carrying value by  and an increase in the discount rate from to changes the excess of estimated fair value over carrying value by the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as determined using projected discounted cash flows assumed that current year results were held constant 
if future operating results were to decline causing the estimated fair value to fall below its carrying value  it is possible that an impairment charge of up to could be recorded 
long lived assets impairment the company performs an impairment review of its long lived assets  primarily property  plant and equipment  when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
any impairment loss is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value 
the company s estimates of future cash flows involve assumptions concerning future operating performance  economic conditions and technological changes that may affect the future useful lives of the assets 
these estimates may differ from actual cash flows or useful lives 
tax valuation allowance the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion of the tax assets will not be realized 
the estimate of the amount that will not be realized requires the use of assumptions concerning the company s future taxable income 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions that management believes are reasonable 
the company considers all sources of taxable income in estimating its valuation allowances  including taxable income in any available carry back period  the reversal of taxable temporary differences  tax planning strategies  and taxable income expected to be generated in the future other than reversing temporary differences 
should the company change its estimate of the amount of its deferred tax assets that it would be able to realize  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease in tax expense in the period such a change in estimate was made 
see note w to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s valuation allowances 
unrecognized tax positions the company recognizes the impact of a tax position if  in the company s opinion  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of that position 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon 
table of contents crown holdings  inc ultimate settlement 
the determination of whether the impact should be recognized  and the measurement of the impact  can require significant judgment and the company s estimate may differ from actual settlement amounts 
see note w to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s tax positions 
pension and postretirement benefits accounting for pensions and postretirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including discount rates  rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  health care cost increases  mortality and employee turnover 
actual results may differ from the company s actuarial assumptions  which may have an impact on the amount of reported expense or liability for pensions or postretirement benefits 
the company recorded pension expense of in and currently projects its pension expense to be using foreign currency exchange rates in effect at december  the rate of return assumptions are reviewed at each measurement date based on the pension plans investment policies  current asset allocations and an analysis of the historical returns of the capital markets 
the us plan s assumed rate of return was in and is in the uk plan s assumed rate of return was in and is in the assumed rate of return for was calculated on a similar basis to as described in note v to the consolidated financial statements 
a change in the expected rates of return would change pension expense by approximately discount rates were selected using a method that matches projected payouts from the plans with zero coupon aa bond yield curves in the respective currencies 
the yield curves were constructed from the underlying bond price and yield data collected as of the plans measurement date and are represented by a series of annualized  individual discount rates with durations ranging from six months to thirty years 
each discount rate in the curve was derived from an equal weighting of the aa bond universe  apportioned into distinct maturity groups 
these individual discount rates were then converted into a single equivalent discount rate 
to assure that the resulting rates can be achieved by the plan  only bonds with sufficient capacity that satisfy certain criteria and are expected to remain available through the period of maturity of the plan benefits were used to develop the discount rate 
a change in the discount rates from those used at december  would change pension expense by approximately and postretirement expense by approximately a change in the discount rates from those used at december  would have changed the pension benefit obligation by approximately and the postretirement benefit obligation by as of december  see note v to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefit obligations and assumptions 
as of december   the company had pre tax unrecognized net losses in other comprehensive income of  related to its pension plans and related to its other postretirement benefit plans 
unrecognized gains and losses arise each year primarily due to changes in discount rates  differences in actual plan asset returns compared to expected returns  and changes in actuarial assumptions such as mortality 
for example  the unrecognized net loss in the company s pension plans included a current year loss of due to actual asset returns lower than expected returns and a loss of primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of compared to unrecognized gains and losses are accumulated in other comprehensive income and the portion in each plan that exceeds of the greater of that plan s assets or projected benefit obligation is amortized to income over future periods 
the company s pension expense for the year ended december  included charges of for the amortization of unrecognized net losses  and the company estimates charges of in the unrecognized net losses in the pension plans as of december  include  in the uk defined benefit plans   in the u 
s defined benefit plans and in the canadian defined benefit plans 
amortizable losses in the uk plan are being recognized over years  representing the average expected life of inactive employees as over of the plan participants are inactive and the fund is 
table of contents crown holdings  inc closed to new participants 
amortizable losses in the us plan are being recognized over the average remaining service life of active participants of years 
amortizable losses in the canadian plans are being recognized over the average remaining service life of active participants of years 
an increase of in the number of years used to amortize unrecognized losses in each plan would decrease estimated charges for by a decrease of in the number of years would increase the estimated charge for by unrecognized net losses of in the company s other postretirement benefit plans as of december   primarily include in the us plans  with the amortizable portion being recognized over the average remaining service life of active participants of years 
the company s other postretirement benefits expense for the year ended december  included charges of for the amortization of unrecognized net losses  and the company estimates charges of in an increase of in the number of years used to amortize the unrecognized losses in each plan would decrease the estimated charge for by a decrease of in the number of years would increase the estimated charge for by stock based compensation calculation of the estimated fair value of stock option awards requires the use of assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  including the expected term of the options  the annual risk free interest rate over the options expected term  the expected annual dividend yield on the underlying stock over the options expected term  and the expected stock price volatility over the options expected term 
the company generally bases its assumptions of option term and expected price volatility on historical data  but also considers other factors  such as vesting or expiration provisions in new awards that are inconsistent with past awards that would make the historical data unreliable as a basis for future assumptions 
estimates of the fair value of stock options are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive stock option awards  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by the company 
see note a and note p to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure of the company s assumptions related to stock based compensation 
recent accounting guidance in june  the fasb issued changes to the presentation of comprehensive income 
these changes give companies the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the fasb eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the fasb did not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
additionally  no changes were made to the calculation and presentation of earnings per share 
these changes become effective for the company on january  the company is currently evaluating these changes to determine which option will be chosen for the presentation of comprehensive income 
other than the change in presentation  the company has determined these changes will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued changes to the disclosure of offsetting assets and liabilities 
these changes require an entity to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
the enhanced disclosures are intended to enable users of an entity s financial statements to understand and evaluate the effect or potential effect of master netting arrangements on an entity s financial position  including the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments 
these changes will be applied retrospectively for interim and annual periods beginning on or after january  the company is currently evaluating the impact of these changes
