md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
this overview summarizes the md a  which includes the following sections our business a general description of the key drivers that affect our business  the industry in which we operate and the strategic initiatives on which we focus 
results of operations an analysis of our overall results of operations and segment results for the three fiscal years presented in our consolidated financial statements appears elsewhere in this report

other miscellaneous and corporate are combined into a third business segment called headquarters other 
liquidity and capital resources an analysis of cash flows  sources and uses of cash  contractual obligations  the impact of currency fluctuations and an overview of our financial condition 
critical accounting estimates a description of accounting estimates that require critical judgments and estimates 
our business executive overview we are an applied technology and advanced materials company 
our mission is to lead in the commercialization of carbon fiber through our development of a price competitive  high performance reinforcement for composites used in a broad range of commercial products which we sell under the panex trade name 
in addition to manufacturing carbon fiber  we produce an intermediate product that we refer to as technical fiber  a stabilized and oxidized acrylic fiber used in flame and heat resistant applications which we sell under the pyron trade name 
we have spent over years developing our proprietary technology and manufacturing processes 
we believe that we have the largest capacity primarily focused on producing low cost carbon fiber for commercial applications 
key performance indicators our management monitors and analyzes several key performance indicators within each of these segments to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance  including revenue 
in the short term  management closely reviews the volume of product shipments and indicated customer requirements in order to forecast revenue and cash receipts 
in the longer term  management believes that revenue growth through sales to new customers in existing applications and new product applications are the best indicator of whether we are achieving our objective of commercializing carbon fiber 
we expect that new applications  including those we are attempting to facilitate  will continue to positively affect demand for our products 
gross profit 
management focuses on improving the gross profit over the long term while leading the commercialization of carbon fiber and controlling associated costs 
the company s strategy is to maintain available unused capacity that positions the company to capture opportunities in emerging applications 
gross margin was positively impacted during fiscal by several factors 
production levels increased with improved sales as we brought our mexican capacity online and increased output in hungary 
we also improved the efficiency of our operations which decreased production costs 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses are driven by headcount and related administrative costs  marketing costs and research and development costs 
we monitor headcount levels in specific geographic and operational areas 
we believe that research and development expenditures are an important means by which we can facilitate new product applications 
cash flow from operating activities 
management believes that operating cash flow is meaningful to investors because it provides a view of zoltek with respect to sustainability of our ongoing operations and the extent to which we may or may not require external capital 
operating cash flow also provides meaningful insight into the management of our working capital 
liquidity and cash flows 
due to the variability in revenue  our cash position varies 
we closely monitor our expected cash levels  particularly as they relate to operating cash flow  days sales outstanding  days payables outstanding and inventory turnover 
management aggressively pursues any late receivables and seeks to actively manage inventory levels in order to effectively use working capital 
management also monitors debt levels and the financing costs associated with debt 
business trends zoltek management has focused its efforts on building on the long term vision of zoltek as the leader in commercialization of carbon fibers as a low cost but high performance reinforcement for composites 
management primarily emphasizes the following areas sales efforts in selected international markets 
we have identified international markets with high growth potential for our existing and emerging commercial applications 
accordingly  we have added sales personnel and increased our marketing efforts in asia 
business development in emerging applications 
we have identified emerging applications for our products with high growth potential across a variety of industries and regions 
we have taken a major step toward growing our carbon fiber prepreg and pultrusion capabilities by opening a  square foot facility outside of st 
louis  missouri in november our intent is to leverage our leadership in commercial carbon fibers to become the leading provider of carbon fiber prepreg and pultrusion in the global marketplace 
our research and development center  to support our targeted applications with high volume manufacturing and processing technologies is located at this facility 
we also expanded our plant in hungary to allow for greater fabric manufacturing capability 
operating cash flows and cash management 
the cash generated by our net income was offset by the buildup of inventory in anticipation of sales growth and contractual requirements and increased receivables

the company historically has not experienced material problems related to the pricing or functionality of carbon fibers inventory 
our panex carbon fibers represent the majority of our inventory balance in continuous tow  fabric  prepreg  chopped and milled forms 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
zoltek management is responsible for routinely assessing whether impairment indicators are present 
the company expects that the components of each operating segment will exhibit similar financial performance over the long term and  therefore  groups assets accordingly for analyzing whether impairment exists 
it is possible that actual future financial performance related to the company s long lived assets may materially differ from the company s determination of expected future financial performance 
additionally  if the company s expected future financial performance undiscounted cash flows was less than the carrying amount of the asset group being analyzed  it would be necessary for the company to make significant judgments regarding the fair value of the asset due to the specialized nature of much of the company s carbon fiber production equipment in order to determine the amount of the impairment charge

supply contracts we are party to a long term supply contract with our wind energy customer vestas wind systems 
in fiscal year  and  we reported net sales of million  million and million to vestas wind systems  which represented  and  respectively  of our net sales 
this was the only customer with whom we have a long term supply agreement that represented greater than of consolidated net sales during any of these three years 
in fiscal  we reported net sales of million  which represented of our total consolidated net sales to saertex gmbh company  a manufacturer of fabrics for the composite industry  including materials for production of wind turbine blades 
we do not have a long term supply agreement with this customer 
we entered into a supply agreement with vestas wind systems in may  which subsequently has been amended 
the contract as currently in effect obligates us to supply carbon fibers under a five year delivery schedule  and a rolling three year schedule as long as the supply agreement is in place 
under the agreement and related amendments  vestas provides us with annual forecasts of its supply requirements  and we receive binding orders for shipments on approximately a monthly basis 
we are not guaranteed specific levels of sales under the agreement  and we are subject to liquidated damages if we are unable to perform our obligations under the agreement 
in general  the agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the parties  by either party with at least months written notice  by either party as a result of a material breach of the agreement that is not remedied within days of receipt of notice of such breach  and by either party in the event of the bankruptcy  insolvency  or change of control of the other party 
in our supply agreement with vestas  we do not have post shipment obligations other than that we warrant that our products are free from defects in design  materials  and workmanship at the time of delivery and that the products are produced in accordance with standard production and sales specifications stated in the agreements 
the agreement states that the warranty shall continue for a period of five years from the date of delivery of the products 
legal contingencies legal contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty 
we establish reserves when losses from contingencies can be reasonably estimated and become probable 
the reserves would reflect management s estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matters and are revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and  ultimately  when matters are brought to closure 
if any litigation matter is resolved unfavorably  the company could incur obligations in excess of management s estimate of the outcome  and such resolution could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
as of september   zoltek has no recorded material legal reserves 
critical accounting estimates certain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
all of the company s accounting policies are in compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates  assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements  and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
accounts receivable collectibility the company evaluates the collectability of our accounts receivable for each of our segments based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filing or substantial downgrading of credit  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against the amounts due reducing the net recognized receivable to the amount we estimate will be collected 
for all other customers  we estimate reserves for bad debts based on the length of time receivables have been past due and our experience with collection 
our bad debt expense on accounts receivable was million for fiscal  less than million for fiscal and million for fiscal contingent liabilities the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations  and other claims related to employment  environmental  service providers  supply agreements  taxing authorities and other matters  and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required  if any  for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
we accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events  and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances  differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages  and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for all share based awards at fair value 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the company uses historical volatility for a period of time that is comparable to the expected life of the option 
fair value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the straight line method 
income taxes the company accounts for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against certain deferred tax assets when realization of those assets are not considered to be more likely than not 
we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous tax authorities 
our operations in these different jurisdictions are generally taxed on income before taxes adjusted for various differences between tax law and gaap accounting 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk the consolidated balance sheets of the company s international subsidiaries  zoltek zrt 
and zoltek de mexico  were translated from hungarian forints and mexican pesos to us dollars  respectively  at the exchange rate in effect at the applicable balance sheet date  while its consolidated statements of operations were translated using the average exchange rates in effect for the periods presented

the company views as long term its investments in zoltek zrt 
and zoltek de mexico 
zoltek zrt 
has a functional currency of the huf 
as a result  the company is exposed to foreign currency risks related to this investment 
the functional currency of zoltek de mexico is the mexican peso to the us dollar 
the company does not currently employ a foreign currency hedging strategy related to the sales from hungary or mexico 
neither hungary nor mexico is considered to be a highly inflationary or deflationary economy 
as of september   the company had a long term loan to its zoltek zrt 
subsidiary of million denominated in us dollars 
the potential loss in value of the company s net foreign currency investment in zoltek zrt 
resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rate of the huf against the us dollar amounted to million as of both september  and the company does not expect repayment of the loan in the foreseeable future 
as such  the company considers this loan as a permanent investment 
if the company chose to cause zoltek zrt 
to repay the loan  however  there could be negative financial statement consequences 
in addition  zoltek zrt 
routinely sells its products to customers located primarily throughout europe in sales transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies other than the huf 
also  zoltek zrt 
has debt that is denominated in foreign currencies other than the huf 
as of september   the company had a long term loan to its zoltek de mexico subsidiary 
there is no potential loss in value of the company s net foreign currency investment in zoltek de mexico resulting from an adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rate of the mexican peso against the us dollar at september  because zoltek de mexico s functional currency is the us dollar 
the company does not expect repayment of the loan in the foreseeable future 
as such  the company considers this loan as a permanent investment 
commodity price risk we are exposed to commodity price risk arising from changes in the market price of certain raw materials  such as acn and utilities 
due to competition and market conditions  volatile price increases cannot always be passed on to our customers 
management assesses commodity price trends on a regular basis and adjusts purchasing accordingly 
the company does not currently utilize derivative instruments to hedge purchases of commodities
