this is the first time since the fiscal year ended that we have achieved profitability for the full year 
website enhancements during  we launched the first phase of a multi phase redesign of our flagship website  autobytel 
com  and a new consumer proposition to be your lifetime automotive advisor 
the launch of the redesigned autobytel 
com reflects ongoing consumer internet and automotive shopping behavioral research  as well as design and navigational principles which we believe will offer consumers a richer and more customized experience 
the objective of the redesign is centered on the your lifetime automotive advisor consumer proposition that expands our offerings and serves the entire automotive lifecycle for visitors to our website 
specifically  the new autobytel 
com reflects enhanced content and tools for those researching a vehicle purchase while at the same time  through our new mygarage vehicle ownership service  offering specific destinations for consumers to better manage maintenance for their vehicles  shop for competitive insurance pricing  and stay informed of manufacturer recalls and special offers  as well as explore their options given the equity they have in an existing vehicle and financial options for trade ins or private resell 
by expanding autobytel 
com s offerings to serve as your lifetime automotive advisor  our goal is to attract a broad scope of consumers to interact with our brand on an on going basis rather than only serving their automotive shopping needs every three to seven years 
ongoing site enhancements such as exclusive vehicle video reviews and comprehensive mobile offerings beginning in the second quarter of ensures that we are serving consumers across multiple channels and devices in recognition of the dynamic evolution of their media and shopping behavior 
we believe that this consumer proposition will ultimately enable us to reposition our brand to benefit from greater consumer satisfaction and recommendations  thus increasing our visitor footprint and driving growth across our purchase request  advertising and data products and services 
performance analytics and sales focus purchase request quality is measured by the conversion of purchase requests to actual vehicle sales 
we rely on detailed feedback from manufacturer and wholesale customers to confirm the performance of our purchase requests 
in addition  in we started using rl polk to evaluate the performance quality of both our internally generated purchase requests as well as those we acquire from our third party purchase request suppliers 
our manufacturer and wholesale customers and rl polk match the purchases requests we deliver to our customers against vehicle sales data to provide us with closing rates for the purchase requests we deliver to our customers and information that allows us to compare these closing rates to the closing rates of the purchase requests we acquire from third party suppliers 
some of the data providers also provide comparisons to closing rates of third party purchase requests delivered by third parties and not delivered by us to our customers 
based on our evaluation of this information  we believe that the purchase requests we deliver to our customers generally are out performing the closing rates of the purchase requests delivered by our third party purchase request suppliers 
with this information  we report a number of key metrics to our customers  allowing them to gain a better understanding of the revenue opportunities that they may realize from acquiring purchase requests from us 
we can now optimize the mix of purchase requests we deliver to our dealers based on multiple sources of quality measurements 
by providing actionable data  we are now placing considerable intelligence in the hands of our customers  and are seeing increased budget allocations for purchasing purchase requests from us 
also during  we began focusing our dealer acquisition and retention strategies on dealerships to which we could deliver a higher percentage of our internally generated purchase requests and that are more cost effective for us to support 
we believe this will result in increased vehicle sales for our dealers and ultimately stronger relationships with us because  based on our evaluation of the third party performance data discussed above  we believe our internally generated purchase requests are of high quality 
we believe that this strategy should allow us to have more profitable relationships with our dealers both in terms of cost to supply purchase requests and to support the dealers 
stock repurchase on february   we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
under the repurchase program  we may repurchase common stock from time to time on the open market or in private transactions 
this authorization does not require us to purchase a specific number of shares  and the board of directors may suspend  modify or terminate it at any time 
we will fund repurchases through the use of available cash 
we currently anticipate that we may initiate repurchases in the open market during the week of march   but the timing and extent of repurchases will depend upon market conditions  legal constraints and other corporate considerations at the company s sole discretion 
nasdaq minimum bid compliance we received a letter dated september   from the nasdaq stock market llc  notifying us that during the preceding consecutive business days  the closing bid price of our common stock was below the minimum bid price per share required for continued listing on the nasdaq global market 
this notification did not result in the immediate delisting of autobytel s common stock from the nasdaq global market 
in accordance with nasdaq rules  autobytel has calendar days  or until march   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by maintaining a closing bid price of per share or higher for a minimum of consecutive business days 
under the listing rules  the nasdaq staff may exercise its discretion to extend this day period 
as of the filing of this annual report on form k with the sec  the company has not regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and will not be able to regain compliance prior to march  due to the condition that the common stock must satisfy the minimum bid requirement for a minimum of consecutive business days 
as a result  nasdaq will provide notice to autobytel that autobytel s common stock is subject to delisting from the nasdaq global market 
once autobytel receives such a notice  it may appeal the delisting determination to the nasdaq hearing panel or may apply to transfer the listing of its common stock to the nasdaq capital market if autobytel satisfies all criteria for initial listing on the nasdaq capital market  other than compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
if such application to the nasdaq capital market is approved  then autobytel may be eligible for an additional grace period 
we are evaluating various options for regaining compliance with the minimum bid price requirement  including a reverse stock split of our common stock 
industry background the internet has been rapidly adopted by consumers engaged in the vehicle purchasing process  primarily because the internet has become the best method to easily find the information necessary to make informed buying decisions 
additionally  the internet has become a primary tool for consumers to begin communicating with local automotive dealers regarding vehicle pricing  availability  options  and financing 
jd power and associates reported in that of all us new light vehicle consumer buyers have moved to the internet as a primary vehicle research and shopping tool 
cnw marketing research reported in that during several phases of the purchase process  more in market shoppers considered third party websites which include autobytel 
com as their primary source for information  thus  surpassing both television and magazines 
in addition  many dealers and all manufacturers use the internet as an efficient way to reach those consumers through marketing programs 
according to a presentation by jd power associates  jd light vehicle sales increased in compared to  or million for from million for the u 
s automotive market shows signs of continued recovery with rl polk and rl power and associates forecasting us light vehicle sales at million and million  respectively  fueled by the increase in the average age of vehicles as well as loosening credit 
we believe this recovery should result in increased use of the internet for consumers engaged in the vehicle purchasing process and increased submission of purchase requests by consumers in strategy our goal is to garner a larger share of the billions of dollars spent annually by dealers and manufacturers on automotive marketing services 
we plan to achieve this objective through the following principal strategies increase revenues from the traffic on our company owned websites 
traffic to our company owned websites is obtained through a variety of sources and methods  including direct navigation to our company owned websites  natural search search engine optimization or seo  which is the practice of optimizing keywords in website content to drive traffic to a website  paid search search engine marketing  or sem  which is the practice of bidding on keywords on search engines to drive traffic to a website  direct marketing  and partnering with other website publishers that provide links to our websites 
traffic to our company owned websites is monetized primarily though the creation of vehicle purchase requests that are delivered to our dealer and manufacturer customers to help them market and sell new and used vehicles  and through the sale of advertising space on our company owned websites 
we plan to increase revenues from our company owned websites by increasing the quality of our purchase requests 
high quality purchase requests are those purchase requests that result in high transaction ie  purchase closing rates for our dealer customers 
purchase requests are internally generated from our company owned websites internally generated purchase requests or acquired non internally generated purchase requests from third parties that generate purchase requests from their websites non company owned websites 
internally generated purchase requests are generally higher quality than non internally generated purchase requests and increase the overall quality of our purchase request portfolio 
non internally generated purchase requests are of varying quality 
therefore  we plan to continue to develop and maintain strong relationships only with suppliers of non internally generated purchase requests that consistently provide high quality purchase requests 
we sell internally generated purchase requests and non internally generated purchase requests directly to dealers and indirectly to dealers through a wholesale market consisting of manufacturers and other third parties in the automotive purchase request distribution industry 
in conjunction with our purchase request programs  we also offer dealers and manufacturers other products and services  including our icontrol by autobyteltm  webleads  email marketing manager  and lead call products and services  to assist them in capturing online  in market customers and selling more vehicles by improving conversion of purchase requests to sale transactions 
increasing traffic acquisition activities 
we plan to increase the traffic to our company owned websites through enhancements to our company owned websites and effective seo and sem traffic acquisition activities 
our goal is that over time  paid traffic such as sem will be balanced by greater visitation from direct navigation and seo  which we expect to result in increased gross profit margins 
enhancing the quality and user experience of our company owned websites 
we continuously make enhancements to our company owned websites  including enhancements of the design and functionality of our company owned websites 
these enhancements are intended to position our company owned websites as comprehensive best in class destinations for automotive purchase research by consumers 
for  our most significant website enhancement involved the redesign of our autobytel 
com website as discussed above under the section of this item entitled significant business developments website enhancements 
increasing the conversion rate of visitors to purchase requests on our company owned websites 
through increased seo and sem activities and significant content  tools  and user interface enhancements to our websites  we believe we will be able to increase the number of website visits and improve website engagement  and thereby increase the conversion of page views into purchase requests 
we believe that an increased conversion rate of page views into purchase requests could result in higher revenue per visitor 
increase purchase request sales to our dealer customers 
sales of vehicle purchase requests to our dealer network constitute a significant source of our revenues 
our goal is to increase the number of vehicle purchase requests sold to our retail dealer customers by increasing the quality of the vehicle purchase requests sold to our dealers  increasing the number of vehicle purchase requests sold to each of our dealers  increasing the number of dealers in our dealer network  providing customizable purchase request programs to meet our dealers unique marketing requirements  providing additional value added marketing services that help dealers more effectively utilize the internet to market and sell new and used vehicles  and increasing overall dealer satisfaction by improving all aspects of our services 
increase vehicle purchase request sales to new and existing manufacturer customers 
we have existing relationships with most manufacturers that market their vehicles in the us we sell vehicle purchase requests to our manufacturer customers that they in turn provide to their dealers to help them market and sell new and used vehicles 
our goal is to increase our sales to these existing customers  as well as new customers  primarily by increasing the quality of the purchase requests we deliver to them 
increase advertising revenues 
as traffic to and time spent on our company owned websites by consumers increases  we will seek to increase our advertising revenues 
we intend to leverage our relationships with manufacturers and their advertising agencies to garner higher rates for our traditional display advertising 
we also intend to provide new advertising offerings built around the enhancements to our company owned websites  including new editorial opportunities and high demand sales event promotions for individual manufacturers 
it is our belief that if the volume of our traffic and performance of the advertisements placed by manufacturers continue to increase as measured by the click through rates and other metrics typically monitored by online marketers  existing and prospective advertisers will recognize this increased value by agreeing to pay higher prices for the advertising space available on our company owned websites 
finally  our goal is to increase the number of our advertising customers and to expand beyond manufacturers to include non manufacturer advertising customers 
expand our products and services 
we gather significant amounts of data on consumer intent as it relates to purchasing vehicles 
we intend to use these data to create products and services  including direct business database offerings  which we believe will ultimately help manufacturers and dealers market and sell more new and used vehicles 
our objective is to generate revenues from this asset in the most effective and efficient ways possible 
acquisitions and strategic alliances 
our goal is to grow and advance our business and we may do so  in part  through acquisitions and strategic alliances 
we continue to review strategic alternatives that may provide opportunities for growth 
we believe that acquisitions and strategic alliances may allow us to increase market share  benefit from advancements in technology  and strengthen our business operations by enhancing our product and service offerings 
our ability to implement the foregoing strategies and plans is subject to risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  there is no assurance that we will successfully implement our strategies and plans

we believe this transfer of consumers from our company owned websites to manufacturer sites is the most significant action measured by manufacturers in evaluating our performance and value as a marketing partner 
most of the manufacturers advertising on our company owned websites have benefitted from above average performance with regard to our performance metrics such as click through rates and actions taken once consumers reach the manufacturer s site 
one hundred percent of the consumer page views generated from manufacturer advertising on our company owned websites are transferred to manufacturer sites

we also license our audience ie  website cookie data to various advertising targeters to add to their existing cookie pools that they offer to advertisers 
we sell our data direct to advertisers and other users of our data without the use of third party advertising targeters 
seasonality our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to unforeseen events affecting the economy and industry in which we operate 
other factors that may adversely affect our quarterly operating results include our purchase request volume  which fluctuates with automotive industry sales volume that has some measure of seasonality 
typically  volume is highest in the spring and summer months  with lower volume in the fall and winter months 
as a result of the effects of seasonality  investors may not be able to predict our annual operating results based on a quarter to quarter comparison of our operating results 
seasonality in the automotive industry is likely to cause fluctuations in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition

additional information regarding certain risks related to our intellectual property is included in part i  item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
competition in the automotive related purchase request marketing services and advertising marketplace we compete for dealer and manufacturer customers 
competition with respect to our core purchase request referral programs continued to be impacted by changing industry conditions in we continue to compete with several companies that maintain business models similar to ours  some with greater resources  and competition has increased from larger competitors that traditionally have competed only in the used vehicle market 
dealers continue to invest in their proprietary websites and traffic acquisition activities  and we expect this trend to continue as dealers strive to own and control more purchase request generating assets under their captive brands 
additionally  all major manufacturers that market their vehicles in the us have their own websites that market their vehicles direct to consumers and generate purchase requests for delivery direct to the manufacturers dealers 
we continue to observe new and emerging business models  including pay per sale and consumer pay models  relating to the generation and delivery of purchase requests 
although these emerging models have garnered attention from dealers and consumers  it is still to be determined whether these new and emerging revenue models will take hold or comply with applicable regulatory or licensing requirements 
in the advertising marketplace  we compete with major internet portals  transaction based websites  automotive related companies and numerous lifestyle websites 
we also compete with traditional marketing channels such as print  radio and television 
operations and technology we believe that our future success is significantly dependent upon our ability to continue to deliver high performance  reliable and comprehensive websites  enhance consumer and dealer product and service offerings  maintain the highest levels of information privacy and ensure transactional security 
our company owned websites are hosted at secure third party data center facilities 
these data centers include redundant power infrastructure  redundant network connectivity  fire detection and suppression systems and security systems to prevent unauthorized access 
our network and computer systems are built on industry standard technology 
system enhancements are primarily intended to accommodate increased traffic across our company owned websites  improve the speed in which purchase requests are processed and introduce new and enhanced products and services 
system enhancements entail the implementation of sophisticated new technology and system processes 
we plan to continue to make investments in technology as we believe appropriate 
government regulation we are subject to laws and regulations generally applicable to providers of advertising and commerce over the internet  including federal and state laws and regulations governing data security and privacy  unfair and deceptive acts and practices  advertising  contests  sweepstakes and promotions  and content regulation

risk factors in addition to the factors discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section of part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form k  the following additional factors may materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
except for fiscal years  and  we have had a history of net annual losses 
we may not be profitable in the future 
if we are unable to sustain profitability in the future and we again experience losses  our business may not be financially viable 
except for fiscal years  and we have experienced net annual losses  and as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we may not be able to sustain profitability in the future  and our potential for future profitability must be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered generally by companies in rapidly evolving markets such as the market for internet commerce and specifically by companies in the automotive marketing services industry 
we believe that to sustain profitability  we must  among other things increase revenues derived from our purchase requests and advertising services  and continue to manage our expenses in a disciplined manner 
our ability to increase vehicle purchase request revenues is dependent on a mix of interrelated factors  including our ability to provide high quality vehicle purchase requests to our customers 
we derive more than of our revenues from vehicle purchase request fees paid by dealers and manufacturers participating in our purchase request programs 
our ability to increase revenues from sales of vehicle purchase requests is dependent on a mix of interrelated factors that include increasing vehicle purchase request revenues by attracting and retaining dealers and manufacturers  increasing the number of high quality vehicle purchase requests we sell to individual dealers and manufacturers  and improving margins by increasing the number of internally generated purchase requests that we sell to our customers 
during we began focusing our dealer acquisition and retention strategies on dealerships where we could deliver a higher percentage of our internally generated purchase requests 
we are also focused on higher revenue dealers  which purchase more of our internally generated purchase requests and are more cost effective to support 
these changes in our sales strategy are intended to result in more profitable relationships with our dealers both in terms of cost to supply purchase requests and to support the dealers 
for  we experienced attrition in the number of our dealers and ended the year with fewer dealers compared to the number of dealers at year end if dealer attrition continues to occur and our new sales focus does not mitigate the loss in revenues by maintaining the overall number of purchase requests sold by increasing sales to other dealers or manufacturers while maintaining the overall margins we receive from the purchase requests sold  our revenues would decrease 
we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to prevent dealer attrition or to offset the revenues lost due to dealer attrition by other means  and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to provide increased number of high quality purchase requests to our customers is dependent on increasing the number of internally generated purchase requests and acquiring high quality leads from third parties 
originating internally generated purchase requests is dependent on our ability to increase consumer traffic to our websites by providing secure and easy to use websites with relevant and quality content for consumers and by increasing visibility of our brands to consumers 
we compete for dealer and manufacturer customers and for acquisition of non internally generated purchase requests with companies that maintain automotive purchase request referral businesses that are very similar to ours 
several of these competitors are larger than us and may have greater financial resources than we have 
if we lose customers or quality purchase request supply volume to our competitors  or if our pricing or cost to acquire purchase requests is impacted  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely impacted 
our ability to increase advertising revenues is largely dependent on our ability to increase consumer traffic to our websites 
we depend on automotive manufacturers for substantially all of our advertising revenues 
the termination of any of these relationships  a decline in the level of advertising with us  reductions in advertising rates or any significant failure to develop additional sources of advertising would cause our advertising revenues to decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we periodically negotiate revisions to existing agreements and these revisions could decrease our advertising revenues in future periods and a number of our advertising agreements with manufacturers may be terminated at any time without cause 
we may not be able to maintain our relationship with manufacturers on favorable terms or find alternative comparable relationships capable of replacing advertising revenues on terms satisfactory to us 
if we cannot do so  our advertising revenues would decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to maintain and add to our relationships with advertisers and thereby increase advertising revenues is dependent on our ability to attract consumers and acquire traffic to our company owned websites and monetize that traffic at profitable margins with advertisers 
our consumer facing websites compete with offerings from the major internet portals  transaction based sites  automotive related verticals websites with content that is primarily automotive in nature and numerous lifestyle websites 
our advertising business is characterized by minimal barriers to entry  and new competitors may be able to launch competitive services at relatively low costs 
if our websites do not provide a compelling  differentiated user experience  we may lose visitors to competing sites and if our website traffic declines  we may lose relevance to our major advertisers who may reduce or eliminate their advertising buys from us 
we are affected by general economic and market conditions  and  in particular  conditions in the automotive industry 
our business  results of operations and financial condition are affected by general economic and market factors  conditions in the automotive industry  and the market for automotive marketing services  including  but not limited to  the following the adverse effect of high unemployment on the number of vehicle purchasers  general uncertainty about the economy  availability of  and interest rates for  financing for vehicle purchases  pricing and purchase incentives for vehicles  disruption in the available inventory of automobiles  the adverse effect of high demand low supply vehicles on the need for purchase requests for such vehicles  gasoline prices  volatility in spending by manufacturers and others in their marketing budgets and allocations  decreases in the number of retail dealers in the industry  and the impact of market factors on our ability to continue to attract  train  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
concentration of credit risk and risks due to significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments and accounts receivable 
cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained with two financial institutions in the united states 
deposits held by banks exceed the amount of insurance provided for such deposits 
generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand 
accounts receivable are primarily derived from fees billed to automotive dealers and manufacturers 
we have a concentration of credit risk with our automotive industry related accounts receivable balances  particularly with autonation  general motors and urban science applications 
during approximately of the company s total revenues were derived from these customers  and approximately or million of gross accounts receivable are receivable from them at december  no collateral is required to support our accounts receivables and we maintain an allowance for bad debts for potential credit losses 
if there is a decline in the general economic environment that negatively affects the financial condition of our customers or an increase in the number of customers that are dissatisfied with their services  additional estimated allowances for bad debts and customer credits may be required and the adverse impact on the our business  results of operations or financial condition could be material 
uncertainty exists in the application of various laws and regulations to our business 
new laws or regulations applicable to our business  or expansion or interpretation of existing laws and regulations to apply to our business  could subject us to licensing  claims  judgments and remedies  including monetary liabilities and limitations on our business practices  and could increase administrative costs or materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we operate in a regulatory climate in which there is uncertainty as to the application of various laws and regulations to our business 
although we do not believe that existing laws or regulations materially and adversely impact us  our business could be significantly affected by different interpretations or applications of existing laws or regulations  future laws or regulations  or actions or rulings by judicial or regulatory authorities 
our operations may be subjected to adoption  expansion or interpretation of various laws and regulations  and compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to obtain licenses at an undeterminable and possibly significant initial and annual expense 
these additional expenditures may increase future overhead  thereby potentially reducing our future results of operations 
there can be no assurances made that future laws or regulations or interpretations or expansions of existing laws or regulations will not impose requirements on internet commerce that could substantially impair the growth of e commerce and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the adoption of additional laws or regulations may decrease the popularity or impede the expansion of e commerce and internet marketing  restrict our present business practices  require us to implement costly compliance procedures or expose us and or our customers to potential liability 
we may be considered to operate or do business in states where our customers conduct their business  resulting in regulatory action 
in the event any state s regulatory requirements impose state specific requirements on us or include us within an industry specific regulatory scheme  we may be required to modify our marketing programs in that state in a manner that may undermine the program s attractiveness to consumers or dealers 
in the alternative  if we determine that the licensing and related requirements are overly burdensome  we may elect to terminate operations in that state 
in each case  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we have identified below areas of government regulation  which if changed or interpreted to apply to our business  we believe could be costly for us 
automotive dealer broker and vehicle advertising laws 
all states comprehensively regulate vehicle sales and lease transactions  including strict licensure requirements for dealers and  in some states  brokers and vehicle advertising 
most of these laws and regulations  we believe  specifically address only traditional vehicle purchase and lease transactions  not internet based purchase request referral programs such as our programs 
we do not believe that our marketing services programs qualify as automobile brokerage activity in most states and  therefore  we do not believe that state motor vehicle dealer or broker licensing requirements apply to us in most states 
if we determine that the licensing or other regulatory requirements in a given state are applicable to us or to a particular marketing services program  we may elect to obtain required licenses and comply with applicable regulatory requirements 
however  if licensing or other regulatory requirements are overly burdensome  we may elect to terminate operations or particular marketing services programs in that state or elect to not operate or introduce particular marketing services programs in that state 
in some states we have modified our marketing programs or pricing models to reduce uncertainty regarding our compliance with local laws 
as we introduce new services  we may need to incur additional costs associated with additional licensing regulations and regulatory requirements 
if any state s licensing or other regulatory requirements relating to motor vehicle dealers or brokers are deemed applicable to us or to any particular marketing services program and we do not comply with those regulatory requirements  we may become subject to fines  penalties or other requirements and may be required to modify our marketing programs or pricing models in those states in a manner that undermines the attractiveness of the program to consumers or dealers 
financial broker and consumer credit laws 
we provide a connection through our websites that allows consumers to obtain finance information and submit purchase requests for vehicle financing to third party lenders 
we also acquire finance related purchase requests from third parties 
we receive marketing fees from financial institutions and dealers in connection with this marketing activity 
we do not demand nor do we receive any fees from consumers for this service 
in the event states require us to be licensed as a financial broker  we may be unable to comply with a state s laws or regulations  or we could be required to incur significant fees and expenses to obtain any financial broker required license and comply with regulatory requirements 
in the event states require us to be licensed and we are unable to do so  or we are otherwise unable to comply with laws or regulations required by changes in current operations or the introduction of new services  we could be subject to fines or other penalties or be compelled to discontinue operations in those states 
in addition  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act established a new consumer financial protection bureau with broad regulatory powers  which could lead to regulation of our finance purchase request business directly or indirectly through regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions 
insurance broker laws 
we provide links on our websites and referrals from call centers enabling consumers to be referred to third parties to receive quotes for insurance and extended warranty coverage from such third parties 
all on line applications for quotes are completed on the respective insurance carriers or other third party websites  and all applications for quotes obtained through call center referrals are conducted by the insurance carrier or other third party 
we receive marketing fees from participants in connection with this marketing activity 
we do not receive any premiums from consumers nor do we charge consumers fees for our services 
we do not believe that these activities require us to be licensed under state insurance laws 
however  if any state insurance licensing laws were determined to be applicable to us and if we are required to be licensed and we are unable to do so  or we are otherwise unable to comply with laws or regulations  we could be subject to fines or other penalties or be compelled to discontinue operations in those states 
changes in the taxation of internet commerce may result in increased costs 
because our business is dependent on the internet  the adoption of new local  state or federal tax laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations by governmental authorities may subject us to additional local  state or federal sales  use or income taxes and could decrease the growth of internet usage or marketing or the acceptance of internet commerce which could  in turn  decrease the demand for our services and increase our costs 
as a result  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
tax authorities in a number of states are currently reviewing and re evaluating the tax treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce  including the application of sales taxes to internet marketing businesses similar to ours 
we accrue for tax contingencies based upon our estimate of the taxes ultimately expected to be paid  which we update over time as more information becomes available  new legislation or rules are adopted or taxing authorities interpret their existing statutes and rules to apply to internet commerce  including internet marketing businesses similar to ours 
the amounts ultimately paid in resolution of reviews or audits by taxing authorities could be materially different from the amounts we have accrued and result in additional tax expense  and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we were audited in june by the new york state department of taxation and finance for sales tax for the period december  through february   and we are awaiting the results of the state s audit 
we are also in an on going income tax examination by the new york state department of taxation and finance for the period january  through december  data security and privacy risks our business is subject to various laws  rules and regulations relating to data security and privacy 
new data security and privacy laws  rules and regulations may be adopted regarding the internet or other on line services that could limit our business flexibility or cause us to incur higher compliance costs 
in each case  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we have identified below some of these risks that we believe could be costly for us 
anti spam laws  rules and regulation 
various state and federal laws  rules and regulations regulate email communications and internet advertising and restrict or prohibit unsolicited email commonly known as spam 
these laws  rules or regulations may adversely affect our ability to market our services to consumers in a cost effective manner 
the federal controlling the assault of non solicited pornography and marketing act of can spam imposes complex and often burdensome requirements in connection with sending commercial emails 
in addition  state laws regulating the sending of commercial emails  including california s law regulating the sending of commercial emails  to the extent found to not be preempted by can spam  may impose requirements or conditions more restrictive than can spam 
violation of these laws  rules or regulations may result in monetary fines or penalties or damage to our reputation 
data privacy laws  rules and regulations 
various laws  rules and regulations govern the collection  use  retention  sharing and security of data that we receive from our users  advertisers  and affiliates 
in addition  we have and post on our website our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection  use and disclosure of user data and personal information 
any failure  or perceived failure  by us to comply with our posted privacy policies  federal trade commission requirements or orders or other federal or state privacy or consumer protection related laws  regulations or industry self regulatory principles could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others 
further  failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies  applicable requirements  or industry self regulatory principles related to the collection  use  sharing or security of personal information or other privacy related matters could result in a loss of user confidence in us  damage to our brands  and ultimately in a loss of users  advertisers  or purchase request referral and advertising affiliates 
we can not predict whether new legislation or regulations concerning data privacy and retention issues related to our business will be adopted  or if adopted  whether they could impose requirements that may result in a decrease in our user registrations and materially and adversely affect our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
proposals that have or that are currently being considered includes restrictions relating to the collection and use of data and information obtained through the tracking of internet use  including the possible implementation of a do not track list  that would allow internet users to opt out of such tracking 
security risks associated with on line purchase requests collection and referral  advertising and e commerce 
a significant issue for on line businesses like ours is the secure transmission of confidential and personal information over public networks 
concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet  consumer identity theft and user privacy issues have been significant barriers to growth in consumer use of the internet  on line advertising  and e commerce 
despite our implementation of security measures  our computer systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break ins  viruses and other disruptive harms and security breaches 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may specifically compromise our security measures 
because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access  disable or degrade service  or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding website visitors  whether through breach of our network by an unauthorized party  employee theft or misuse  or otherwise  could harm our reputation and brands  substantially impair our ability to attract and retain our audiences  or subject us to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers 
if consumers experience identity theft after using any of our websites  we may be exposed to liability  adverse publicity and damage to our reputation 
to the extent that identity theft gives rise to reluctance to use our websites or a decline in consumer confidence in financial transactions over the internet  our business could be adversely affected 
alleged or actual breaches of the network of one of our business partners or competitors whom consumers associate with us could also harm our reputation and brands 
in addition  we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state  federal and foreign laws regarding the unauthorized disclosure of personal information 
for example  california law requires companies to inform individuals of any security breaches that result in their personal information being stolen 
because our success depends on the acceptance of on line services and e commerce  we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by those breaches 
internet fraud has been increasing over the past few years  and fraudulent on line transactions  should they continue to increase in prevalence  could also materially and adversely affect the customer experience and therefore our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are insured for some  but not all  of the foregoing risks 
even for those risks for which we are insured and have coverage under the terms and conditions of the applicable policies  there are no assurances given that the coverage limits would be sufficient to cover all costs  liabilities or losses we might incur or experience 
technology risks our business is dependent on keeping pace with advances in technology 
if we are unable to keep pace with advances in technology  consumers may stop using our services and our revenues will decrease 
if we are required to invest substantial amounts in technology  our results of operations will be adversely impacted 
the internet and electronic commerce markets are characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements  frequent new service and product introductions embodying new technologies  including mobile internet applications  and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing websites and technology obsolete 
these market characteristics are intensified by the emerging nature of the market and the fact that many companies are expected to introduce new internet products and services in the near future 
if we are unable to adapt to changing technologies  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our performance will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to enhance our existing services  develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers  license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
the development of our websites  mobile applications  and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks 
we may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our websites  or other proprietary technology to customer requirements or to emerging industry standards 
in addition  if we are required to invest substantial amounts in technology in order to keep pace with technological advances  our business results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
interruptions or failures in our information technology platforms  communication systems  or security systems could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial conditions 
our information technology and communications systems are susceptible to outages and interruptions due to fire  flood  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failures  cyber attacks  terrorist attacks  failure of redundant systems and disaster recovery plans and similar events 
such outages and interruptions could damage our reputation and harm our operating results 
despite our network security measures  our information technology platforms are vulnerable to computer viruses  worms  physical and electronic break ins  sabotage  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering  as well as coordinated denial of service attacks 
we do not have multiple site capacity for all of our services 
in the event of delays or disruptions to services we rely on third party providers to perform disaster recovery planning and services on our behalf 
we are vulnerable to extended failures to the extent that planning and services are not adequate to meet our continued technology platform  communication or security systems needs 
we rely on third party providers for our primary and secondary internet connections 
our co location service which provides environmental and power support for our technology platforms  communication systems  and security systems is received from a third party provider 
we have little or no control over these third party providers 
any disruption of the services they provide us or any failure of these third party providers to effectively plan for increases in capacity could  in turn  cause delays or disruptions in our services 
we are insured for some  but not all  of these events 
even for those events for which we are insured and have coverage under the terms and conditions of the applicable policies  there are no assurances given that the coverage limits would be sufficient to cover all losses we might incur or experience 
we are exposed to risks associated with outsourcing of software development overseas 
we currently outsource software development and maintenance for some of our systems to overseas contractors 
overseas outsourcing is subject to many inherent risks  including but not limited to political  social and economic instability  exposure to different business practices and legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  continuation of overseas conflicts and the risk of terrorist attacks and resulting heightened security  the imposition of governmental controls and restrictions and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  nationalization of business and blocking of cash flows  changes in taxation and tariffs  and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
securities market risks the public market for our common stock may be volatile  especially since market prices for internet related and technology stocks have often been unrelated to operating performance 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq global market  but we cannot assure that an active trading market will be sustained or that the market price of the common stock will not decline 
the stock market in general has experienced significant price fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  historical and anticipated operating metrics such as the number of participating dealers  volume of purchase request deliveries to dealers  the number of visitors to our company owned websites and the frequency with which they interact with our company owned websites  announcements of new product or service offerings  technological innovations  low trading volumes  concentration of holdings in our common stock resulting in low public float for our shares  decisions by holders of large blocks of our stock to sell their holdings on accelerated time schedules  including by reason of their decision to liquidate investment funds that hold our stock  limited analyst coverage of the company  competitive developments  including actions by manufacturers  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to meet such estimates  conditions and trends in the internet  electronic commerce and automotive industries  our ability to comply with the conditions to continued listing of our stock on the nasdaq global market  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the technology or automotive industry  the impact of open market repurchases of our common stock  and general market or economic conditions and other factors 
further  the stock markets  and in particular the nasdaq global market  have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies and have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market factors have affected and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  interest rates  energy prices  international currency fluctuations  terrorist acts  political revolutions  military actions or wars  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies with publicly traded securities 
this litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq global market if we are not able to satisfy continued listing requirements  and if this were to occur  the price of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely affected and the ability to buy and sell our stock may be less orderly and efficient 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq global market 
continued listing of a security on the nasdaq global market is conditioned upon compliance with various continued listing standards 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to satisfy the requirements for maintaining a nasdaq global market listing 
the standards for continued listing require  among other things  that the closing minimum bid price for the listed securities be at least per share for consecutive trading days 
with very few exceptions  the closing bid price for our shares has been less than per share since august   and there can be no assurances made that we will satisfy the minimum bid price required for continued listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global market 
we received a letter dated september   from the nasdaq stock market llc  notifying us that during the preceding consecutive business days  the closing bid price of our common stock was below the minimum bid price per share required for continued listing on the nasdaq global market 
this notification did not result in the immediate delisting of autobytel s common stock from the nasdaq global market 
in accordance with nasdaq rules  autobytel has calendar days  or until march   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by maintaining a closing bid price of per share or higher for a minimum of consecutive business days 
under the listing rules  the nasdaq staff may exercise its discretion to extend this day period 
as of the filing of this annual report on k with the sec  the company has not regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and will not be able to regain compliance prior to march  due to the condition that the common stock must satisfy the minimum bid requirement for a minimum of consecutive business days 
as a result  nasdaq will provide notice to autobytel that autobytel s common stock is subject to delisting from the nasdaq global market 
once autobytel receives this notice  it may appeal the delisting determination to the nasdaq hearing panel or may apply to transfer the listing of its common stock to the nasdaq capital market if autobytel satisfies all criteria for initial listing on the nasdaq capital market  other than compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
if such application to the nasdaq capital market is approved  then autobytel may be eligible for an additional grace period 
we are evaluating various options for regaining compliance with the minimum bid price requirement  including a reverse stock split of our common stock 
risks associated with litigation misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights  enforcement actions to protect our intellectual property and claims from third parties relating to intellectual property could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the internet and technology industries 
we expect that internet technologies and software products and services may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
our ability to compete depends upon our proprietary systems and technology 
while we rely on trademark  trade secret  patent and copyright law  confidentiality agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights  we believe that the technical and creative skills of our personnel  continued development of our proprietary systems and technology  brand name recognition and reliable website maintenance are more essential in establishing and maintaining a leadership position and strengthening our brands 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult 
we have no assurance that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable 
effective trademark  service mark  patent  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available when our products and services are made available on line 
in addition  if litigation becomes necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity  this litigation  even if successful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
we also have no assurances that our products and services do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
claims of infringement  even if unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
if we are not successful  we may be subject to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and monetary damages which may be trebled in the case willful infringements 
we could be adversely affected by actions of third parties that could subject us to litigation that could significantly and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we could face liability for information retrieved or obtained from or transmitted over the internet by third parties and liability for products sold over the internet by third parties 
we could be exposed to liability with respect to third party information that may be accessible through our websites  links or vehicle review services 
these claims might  for example  be made for defamation  negligence  patent  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury  breach of contract  unfair competition  false advertising  invasion of privacy or other legal theories based on the nature  content or copying of these materials 
these claims might assert  among other things that  by directly or indirectly providing links to websites operated by third parties we should be liable for copyright or trademark infringement or other wrongful actions by such third parties through those websites 
it is also possible that  if any third party content provided on our websites contains errors  consumers could make claims against us for losses incurred in reliance on such information 
any claims could result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause delays in releasing new or upgrading existing services or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
we also enter into agreements with other companies under which any revenues that results from the purchase or use of services through direct links to or from our websites or on our websites is shared 
in addition  we acquire personal information and data in the form of purchase requests purchased from third party websites involving consumers who submitted personally identifiable information and data to the third parties and not directly to us 
these arrangements may expose us to additional legal risks and uncertainties  including disputes with these parties regarding revenue sharing  local  state and federal government regulation and potential liabilities to consumers of these services  even if we do not provide the services ourselves or have direct contact with the consumer 
these liabilities can include liability for violations by these third parties of laws  rules and regulations  including those related to data security and privacy laws and regulations  unsolicited email  text messaging  telephone or wireless voice marketing  and licensing 
we have no assurance that any indemnification provided to us in our agreements with these third parties  if available  will be adequate 
we could be materially and adversely affected by other litigation 
from time to time  we are involved in litigation or legal matters not related to intellectual property rights and arising from the normal course of our business activities 
the actions filed against us and other litigation or legal matters  even if not meritorious  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and an adverse outcome in litigation could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our liability insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  tax benefit preservation plan and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a third party from acquiring us or limit the price third parties are willing to pay for our stock 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws relating to our corporate governance and provisions in our tax benefit preservation plan tax benefit preservation plan could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  and could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us 
these provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
the issuance of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers  including voting rights  of the holders of the common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allow us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the board of directors is divided into three classes  which may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or change in our management because less than a majority of the board of directors are up for election at each annual meeting 
in addition  provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect corporate actions such as a merger  asset sale or other change of control of us 
under our tax benefit preservation plan  rights to purchase capital stock of the company rights have been distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of common stock 
each right entitles its holder  upon triggering of the rights  to purchase one one hundredth of a share of series a junior participating preferred stock of the company at a price of as such price may be adjusted under the tax benefit preservation plan or  in certain circumstances  to instead acquire shares of common stock 
the rights will convert into a right to acquire common stock or other capital stock of the company in certain circumstances and subject to certain exceptions 
the rights will be triggered upon the acquisition of or more of the company s outstanding common stock or future acquisitions by any existing holders of or more of the company s outstanding common stock 
if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock  all rights holders  except the acquirer  will be entitled to acquire at the then exercise price of a right that number of shares of our common stock which  at the time  has a market value of two times the exercise price of the right 
the tax benefit preservation plan authorizes our board of directors to exercise discretionary authority to deem a person acquiring common stock in excess of not to be an acquiring person under the tax benefit preservation plan  and thereby not trigger the rights  if the board finds that the beneficial ownership of shares by the person acquiring the shares will not be likely to directly or indirectly limit the availability to the company of the net operating loss carryovers and other tax attributes that the plan is intended to preserve or is otherwise in the best interests of the company 
we are also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  the statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
for purposes of section  a business combination includes a merger  asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder  and an interested stockholder is a person who  together with affiliates and associates  owns or did own or more of the corporation s voting stock 
section could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us 
if our internal controls and procedures fail  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected 
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in making its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   management used the criteria described in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  that results in a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
management determined that we had no material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  our internal controls may not prevent all potential errors and fraud  because any control system  no matter how well designed  can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved 
we have had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the past and there is no assurance that we will not have one or more material weaknesses in the future resulting from failure of our internal controls and procedures 
our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis could be adversely affected by a failure in our internal control over financial reporting 
if our financial statements are not fairly presented  investors may not have an accurate understanding of our operating results and financial condition 
if our financial statements are not timely filed with the sec  we could be delisted from the nasdaq global market 
if either or both of these events occur  it could have a material adverse affect on our ability to operate our business and the market price of our common stock 
in addition  a failure in our internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow
