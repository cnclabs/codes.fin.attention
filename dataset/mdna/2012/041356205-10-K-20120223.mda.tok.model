is a principal investment firm that acquires and holds mortgage related and other assets 
we acquire residential mortgage backed securities mbs  either issued by us government agencies or guaranteed as to principal and interest by us government agencies or us government sponsored entities agency backed mbs 
we also acquire mbs issued by private organizations private label mbs subject to maintaining our exemption from regulation as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended act 
when we use the terms arlington asset  aaic  we us our and the company  we mean arlington asset investment corp 
and its consolidated subsidiaries 
we are a virginia corporation and taxed as a c corporation for federal income tax purposes 
we operate primarily in the united states 
factors that affect our results of operations and financial condition our business is materially affected by a variety of industry and economic factors  including conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions  changes in interest rates and prepayment rates  actions taken by the united states us federal reserve and the us treasury  changes in laws and regulations and industry practices  actions taken by ratings agencies with respect to the us s credit rating  and other market developments 
in recent years and months  the conditions in the us and global financial markets have changed suddenly and negatively and may continue to change adversely in future periods 
at this time  there is a growing expectation for a slowdown in economic growth globally 
in response to the financial issues affecting the banking system and the financial markets  governments  regulators and central banks in the us and worldwide have taken  and may continue to take  numerous steps to increase liquidity and to restore investor confidence 
adverse market conditions and actions by governmental authorities could adversely affect our business in many ways  including but not limited to making it more difficult for us to analyze our investment portfolio  adversely affecting our ability to maintain targeted amounts of leverage on our mbs portfolio and successfully implement our hedging strategy  and limiting our ability to follow our current investment and financing strategies 
while uncertain  these potentially adverse market conditions and actions by governmental authorities may adversely affect our liquidity  financial position and results of operations 
we have been and will continue to evaluate the potential impact of recent government actions  including developments relating to foreclosure suspensions and affidavit errors and various state and federal government actions affecting the market price of mbs and related derivative securities 
while it is predictably difficult to foresee the short and long term impact of foreclosure issues given all the uncertainties  at this time  we do not anticipate that the current foreclosure issues will have a material negative effect on our overall position and results of operations 
for further discussions on how market conditions and government actions may adversely affect our business  see item a risk factors 
our mbs portfolio is affected by general us residential real estate market conditions and the overall us economic environment 
in particular  our mbs strategy and the performance of our mbs portfolio is influenced by the specific characteristics of these markets  including prepayment rates  credit losses  interest rates and the interest rate yield curve 
our results of operations with respect to our mbs portfolio primarily depend on  among other things  the level of our interest income and the amount and cost of borrowings we may obtain by pledging our investment portfolio as collateral for the borrowings 
our interest income  which includes the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of discounts  varies primarily as a result of changes in prepayment speeds of the securities in our mbs portfolio 
our borrowing cost varies based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount we can borrow which is generally based on the fair value of the mbs portfolio and the advance rate the lenders are willing to lend against the collateral provided 
the payment of principal and interest on the agency backed mbs that we acquire and hold is guaranteed by the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or the federal national mortgage association fannie mae 
the payment of principal and interest on agency backed mbs issued by freddie mac or fannie mae is not guaranteed by the us government 
any failure to honor its guarantee of agency backed mbs by freddie mac or fannie mae or any downgrade of securities issued by freddie mac or fannie mae by the rating agencies could cause a significant decline in the value of and cash flow from any agency backed mbs we own that are guaranteed by such entity 

table of contents current market conditions and trends conditions in the us financial markets improved during despite a continued slow recovery for the us economy 
the improvements in the markets  however  remains uneven and vulnerable to changes in investor sentiment 
for example  while us corporate bond markets increased new issue volumes during  securitization markets have been slower to recover and conditions in certain segments remain uncertain 
in addition  although trading activity has increased in the private label mbs market  the supply of newly issued securities is still limited 
as a result  the overall value of these private label mbs has increased 
we believe the general business environment will continue to be challenging in and future periods 
our growth outlook is dependent  in part  on the extent and severity of the financial market dislocation  the impact of fiscal and monetary policy actions by the united states and other countries and the overall market value of us equities and liquidity 
recent government activity on january   the us federal reserve released a report titled the us housing market current conditions and policy considerations to congress providing a framework for thinking about certain issues and tradeoffs that policy makers might consider 
it is unclear how future legislation may impact the housing finance market and the investing environment for agency backed mbs as the method of reform is undecided and has not yet been defined by the regulators 
in september  the us federal reserve announced its operation twist maturity extension program pursuant to which it intends to sell billion of shorter term us treasury securities by the end of june and use the proceeds to buy longer term us treasury securities 
this program is intended to extend the average maturity of the securities in the us federal reserve s portfolio 
by reducing the supply of longer term us treasury securities in the market  this action should put downward pressure on longer term interest rates  including rates on financial assets that investors consider to be close substitutes for longer term us treasury securities  like certain types of agency backed mbs 
the reduction in longer term interest rates  in turn  may contribute to a broad easing in financial market conditions that the us federal reserve hopes will provide additional stimulus to support the economic recovery 
in september  the white house announced that the current administration is working on a major plan to allow some of the million homeowners who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth to refinance 
consequently  in october the federal housing finance agency fhfa announced changes to the home affordable refinance program harp to expand access to refinancing for qualified individuals and families whose homes have lost value 
one such change is to increase the harp loan to value ceiling above 
however  this would only apply to mortgages guaranteed by government sponsored entities gses  such as fannie mae and freddie mac 
there are many challenging issues to this proposal  notably the question as to whether a loan with a or greater loan to value ratio qualifies as a mortgage or an unsecured consumer loan 
the chances of this initiative s success and other ideas proposed by the us federal reserve s white paper  have created additional uncertainty in the mbs market  particularly with respect to possible increases in prepayment rates 
in september  the us securities and exchange commission sec issued a concept release no 
ic  file no 
sw  companies engaged in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage related instruments pursuant to which it is reviewing whether certain companies that invest in mbs and rely on the exemption from registration under section c c of the act such as our company should continue to be allowed to rely on such exemption from registration 
in february  the us treasury along with the us department of housing and urban development released a report titled reforming america s housing finance market to congress outlining recommendations for reforming the us housing system  specifically fannie mae and freddie mac  and transforming the government s involvement in the housing market 
it is unclear how future legislation may impact the housing finance market and the investing environment for agency mbs as the method of reform is undecided and has not yet been defined by the regulators 
on july   president obama signed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act into law 
the dodd frank act is extensive  complicated and comprehensive legislation that impacts practically all aspects of banking  and a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry 
although many provisions remain subject to further rulemaking  the dodd frank act implements numerous and far reaching changes that affect financial companies  including our company  and other banks and institutions that are important to our business model 
certain notable rules are  among other things requiring regulation and oversight of large  systemically important financial institutions by establishing an interagency council on systemic risk and implementation of heightened prudential standards and regulation by the board of governors of the us federal reserve for systemically important financial institutions including nonbank financial companies  as well as the implementation of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic resolution procedures for liquidation of large financial companies to avoid market disruption  applying the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies  savings and loan holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial companies  
table of contents limiting the us federal reserve s emergency authority to lend to nondepository institutions to facilities with broad based eligibility  and authorizing the fdic to establish an emergency financial stabilization fund for solvent depository institutions and their holding companies  subject to the approval of congress  the secretary of the us treasury and the us federal reserve  creating regimes for regulation of over the counter derivatives and non admitted property and casualty insurers and reinsurers  implementing regulation of hedge fund and private equity advisers by requiring such advisers to register with the sec  providing for the implementation of corporate governance provisions for all public companies concerning proxy access and executive compensation  and reforming regulation of credit rating agencies 
many of the provisions of the dodd frank act  including certain provisions described above are subject to further study  rulemaking  and the discretion of regulatory bodies 
as the hundreds of regulations called for by the dodd frank act are promulgated  we will continue to evaluate the impact of any such regulations 
it is unclear how this legislation may impact the borrowing environment  interest rates  investing environment for agency backed mbs and private label mbs and derivatives as much of the bill s implementation has not yet been defined by the regulators 
certain programs initiated by the us government through the federal housing administration and the fdic to provide homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential mortgage loan foreclosures are currently in effect 
the programs may involve  among other things  the modification of mortgage loans to reduce the principal amount of the loans or the rate of interest payable on the loans  or to extend the payment terms of the loans 
for example  obama administration s homeowner affordability and stability plan hasp is a multi faceted plan intended to prevent residential mortgage foreclosures 
executive summary during  we continued to evaluate the opportunities across the mortgage industry and seek the highest risk adjusted returns for our capital 
we evaluated and prioritized the risk adjusted return we expect to receive on every asset based upon a current cash yield perspective as well as from a total yield perspective that includes expected reflation  which is defined as an increase in value between the amortized cost basis and the par value of the security 
historically  based on market conditions  we believe our mbs assets have provided us with higher relative risk adjusted rates of return than most other portfolio opportunities we have evaluated 
consequently  we have maintained a high allocation of our assets and capital in this sector 
we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities against the returns available in each of our asset alternatives and endeavor to allocate our assets and capital with an emphasis toward what we believe will generate the highest risk adjusted return available 
this strategy may cause us to have different allocations of capital in different environments 
we believe we have constructed a private label mbs portfolio with attractive characteristics and will continue to monitor relative value between the various classes of mbs 
as we continue to reallocate our capital to agency backed mbs  we will continue to seek to identify potential opportunities to strengthen our position and to maximize return to our shareholders 
during  we redeployed approximately million of capital from sales of private label mbs  primarily to our agency backed mbs portfolio 
as of december   our leveraged agency backed mbs portfolio consisted of million in face value with a cost basis of million and a fair value of million 
this migration of capital to agency backed mbs portfolio during contributed significantly to the increase in net interest income and growth in distributable income and dividends to our shareholders 
as a result  our non gaap core operating income also increased significantly  million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  given current market conditions  while no assurance can be given  we intend to continue to deploy additional capital to our agency backed mbs portfolio with the objective of further increasing net interest income and non gaap core operating income 
for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or per share diluted  compared to million  or per share diluted  for the year ended december  as of december   our book value per share was 
our net income includes net interest income of million for the year ended december  compared to net interest income of million for the year ended december  our other expenses decreased to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the following is a summary of our statement of operations for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands net interest income other loss income  net other expenses income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision net income from continuing operations  net of taxes loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to arlington asset investment corp 
shareholders 
table of contents in addition to the financial results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as consistently applied in the united states gaap  we calculated non gaap core operating income for the years ended december  and our core operating income for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
in determining core operating income  we excluded certain costs and the following non cash expenses compensation costs associated with stock based awards  accretion of mbs purchase discounts adjusted for principal repayments in excess of proportionate invested capital  unrealized mark to market adjustments on the trading mbs and hedge instruments and other than temporary impairment charges recognized 
this non gaap measurement is used by management to analyze and assess the operating results and dividends 
we believe that this non gaap measurement assists investors in understanding the impact of these non core items and non cash expenses on our performance and provides additional clarity around our forward earnings capacity and trend 
a limitation of utilizing this non gaap measure is that the gaap accounting effects of these events do in fact reflect the underlying financial results of our business and these effects should not be ignored in evaluating and analyzing our financial results 
therefore  we believe net income on a gaap basis and core operating income on a non gaap basis should be considered together 
the following is a reconciliation of gaap net income to non gaap core operating income for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  gaap net income adjustments adjusted expenses stock compensation net unrealized mark to market loss on trading mbs and hedge instruments other than temporary impairment charges adjusted interest related to purchase discount accretion non gaap core operating income adjusted expenses reflect certain professional fees and income taxes that are not considered representative of routine or core operating related activities of our company 
adjusted interest related to purchase discount accretion represents purchase discount accretion in excess of principal repayment in excess of proportional share of invested capital 
as of december   our agency backed mbs consisted of million in face value with a cost basis of million and was fair valued at million 
our agency backed mbs had a weighted average coupon of and a weighted average cost of funding of basis points at december  we have hedged against the market value movements of our agency backed mbs using eurodollar and us treasury futures 
the eurodollar futures mature through september  and have a lifetime weighted average rate of as of december  the value of these five year hedge instruments is expected to fluctuate inversely relative to the agency backed mbs portfolio and decrease in value during periods of declining interest rates and or widening mortgage spreads 
conversely  during periods of increasing rates and or tightening mortgage spreads  these instruments are expected to increase in value 
the cost of these eurodollar hedges will increase over their five year term 
the us treasury futures are year us treasury note futures that mature in march see note to our consolidated financial statements included under
