table of contents year and reversed the contingent consideration related to these acquisitions 
during the third quarter of  we reevaluated the probability of tiermed achieving the specified predetermined ebitda and revenue targets and reversed its contingent consideration related to this acquisition 
as of december   we discontinued operations of our claim consulting business located in new hope  pennsylvania and the united kingdom 
there was no impact of discontinued operations on the results of operations for the years ended december    and in conjunction with the ipo  the stock of insurance services office  inc converted to stock of verisk analytics  inc  which effected a fifty to one stock split of its common stock 
the numbers in the above table reflect this stock split 
ebitda is the financial measure  which management uses to evaluate the performance of our segments 
ebitda is defined as net income before investment income and realized gain loss on securities  net  interest expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets 
beginning in our ebitda includes acquisition related liability adjustments for all periods presented 
in addition  this management s discussion and analysis includes references to ebitda margin  which is computed as ebitda divided by revenues 
see note of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
although ebitda is a non gaap financial measure  ebitda is frequently used by securities analysts  lenders and others in their evaluation of companies  ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations or cash flow from operating activities reported under gaap 
management uses ebitda in conjunction with traditional gaap operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance 
some of these limitations are ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
includes capital lease obligations 
prior to our corporate reorganization  we were required to record our class a common stock and vested options at redemption value at each balance sheet date as the redemption of these securities was not solely within our control  due to our contractual obligations to redeem these shares 
we classified this redemption value as redeemable common stock 
after our ipo  we were no longer obligated to redeem these shares and therefore we reversed the redeemable common stock balance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further information 
subsequent to our corporate reorganization  share repurchases are recorded as treasury stock within stockholders deficit  as we intend to reissue shares from treasury stock in the future 
for the years ended december  and  we repurchased million and million  respectively  of treasury stock 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  as well as the discussion under selected consolidated financial data 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including but not limited to those listed under risk factors and special note regarding forward looking statements 
we enable risk bearing businesses to better understand and manage their risks 
we provide value to our customers by supplying proprietary data that  combined with our analytic methods  creates embedded decision support solutions 
we are the largest aggregator and provider of data pertaining to us property and casualty  or p c  insurance risks 
we offer solutions for detecting fraud in the us p c insurance  mortgage and healthcare industries and sophisticated methods to predict and quantify loss in diverse contexts ranging from natural catastrophes to supply chain to health insurance 
our customers use our solutions to make better risk decisions with greater efficiency and discipline 
we refer to these products and services as solutions due to the integration among our products and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package of products 
these solutions take various forms  including data  statistical models or tailored analytics  all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions 
we believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers revenues and help them better manage their costs 
on may   in contemplation of our ipo  insurance service office  inc  or iso  formed verisk analytics  inc  or verisk  a delaware corporation  to be the holding company for our business 
verisk was initially formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of iso 
on october  in connection with our ipo  we effected a reorganization whereby iso became a wholly owned subsidiary of verisk 
on october   we completed a follow on public offering 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock in the offering 
the primary purpose of the offering was to manage and organize the sale by class b insurance company shareholders while providing incremental public float 
concurrently with the closing of the offering  we repurchased shares of common stock  for an aggregate purchase price of million  directly from selling shareholders owning class b common stock 
we converted all class b shares to class a shares in and currently have no outstanding class b shares 
we organize our business in two segments risk assessment and decision analytics 
our risk assessment segment provides statistical  actuarial and underwriting data for the us p c insurance industry 
our risk assessment segment revenues represented approximately and of our revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our decision analytics segment provides solutions our customers use to analyze the processes of the verisk risk analysis framework prediction of loss  detection and prevention of fraud  and quantification of loss 
effective december   we realigned the revenue categories within decision analytics segment  including fraud identification and detection solutions  loss prediction solutions and loss quantification solutions  into four vertical market related groupings of insurance  mortgage and financial services  healthcare  and specialized markets 
we believe that this enhances financial reporting transparency and helps investors better understand the themes within the decision analytics segment 
our decision analytics segment revenues represented approximately and of our revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
executive summary key performance metrics we believe our business s ability to generate recurring revenue and positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy 
we use year over year revenue growth and ebitda margin 
table of contents as metrics to measure our performance 
ebitda and ebitda margin are non gaap financial measures see note within item selected financial data section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue growth 
we use year over year revenue growth as a key performance metric 
we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers  sales to new customers  sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses 
ebitda margin 
we use ebitda margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business 
we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth 
revenues we earn revenues through subscriptions  long term agreements and on a transactional basis 
subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period  which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year 
as a result  the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments 
examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language  our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period 
in general  we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business 
our long term agreements are generally for periods of three to seven years 
we recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most long term agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis 
for example  we have solutions that allow our customers to access fraud detection tools in the context of an individual mortgage application or loan  obtain property specific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building  or compare a p c insurance  medical or workers compensation claim with information in our databases 
for the years ended december  and  and of our revenues  respectively  were derived from providing transactional solutions 
we earn transactional revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed 
in general  transactions are billed monthly at the end of each month 
approximately and of the revenues in our risk assessment segment for the years ended december  and  respectively  were derived from subscriptions and long term agreements for our solutions 
our customers in this segment include most of the p c insurance providers in the united states 
approximately and of the revenues in our decision analytics segment  for the years ended december  and  respectively  were derived from subscriptions and long term agreements for our solutions 
principal operating costs and expenses personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses 
personnel expenses include salaries  benefits  incentive compensation  equity compensation costs described under equity compensation costs below  sales commissions  employment taxes  recruiting costs  and outsourced temporary agency costs  which represented and of our total expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we allocate personnel expenses between two categories  cost of revenues and selling  general and administrative costs  based on the actual costs associated with each employee 
we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues  and all other personnel  including executive managers  sales people  
table of contents marketing  business development  finance  legal  human resources  and administrative services  as selling  general and administrative expenses 
a significant portion of our other operating costs  such as facilities and communications  are also either captured within cost of revenues or selling  general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed 
while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities  we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues 
historically  our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses 
cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data  the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our next generation solutions 
our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization 
selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs 
a portion of the other operating costs such as facilities  insurance and communications are also allocated to selling  general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee 
our selling  general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization

equity compensation costs we have a leveraged esop  funded with intercompany debt that includes k  esop and profit sharing components to provide employees with equity participation 
we make quarterly cash contributions to the plan equal to the debt service requirements 
as the debt is repaid  shares are released to the esop to fund k matching and profit sharing contributions and the remainder is allocated annually to active employees in proportion to their eligible compensation in relation to total participants eligible compensation 
we accrue compensation expense over the reporting period equal to the fair value of the shares to be released to the esop 
depending on the number of shares released to the plan during the quarter and the fluctuation in the fair value of the shares  a corresponding increase or decrease in compensation expense will occur 
the amount of our equity compensation costs recognized for the years ended december   and are as follows year ended december  in thousands esop costs by contribution type k matching contribution expense profit sharing contribution expense esop allocation expense total esop costs esop costs by segment risk assessment esop costs decision analytics esop costs total esop costs

in addition  the portion of the esop allocation expense related to the appreciation of the value of the shares in the esop above the value of those shares when the esop was first established is not tax deductible 
prior to our ipo  our class a stock and vested stock options were recorded within redeemable common stock at full redemption value at each balance sheet date  as the redemption of these securities was not solely within the control of the company see note of our consolidated financial statements 
effective with the corporate reorganization that occurred on october   we are no longer obligated to redeem class a stock and therefore are not required to present our class a stock and vested stock options at redemption value 
our financial results for the fourth quarter of reflect a reversal of the redeemable common stock 
the reversal of the redeemable common stock of  million on october  resulted in the elimination of accumulated deficit of million  an increase of million to class a common stock at par value  an increase of million to additional paid in capital  and a reclassification of the iso class a unearned common stock ksop shares balance of million to unearned ksop contribution

quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth our quarterly unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  in management s opinion  the data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  and reflects all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of this data 
the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period

subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in 
table of contents advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period  which is usually for one year 
subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year 
we have historically generated significant cash flows from operations 
as a result of this factor  as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility  we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs  and to fuel our future growth plans 
we have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that  as described above  we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long term contracts  which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered 
when cash is received for prepayment of invoices  we record an asset cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability fees received in advance 
this current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services 
in most businesses  growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows 
unlike these businesses  our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth  which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services 
our capital expenditures  which include non cash purchases of fixed assets and capital lease obligations  as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december  and  were and  respectively 
we estimate our capital expenditures for will be approximately million  which primarily include expenditures on our technology infrastructure and our continuing investments in developing and enhancing our solutions 
expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal use software and are capitalized in accordance with asc  accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
we also capitalize amounts in accordance with asc  software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we have also historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders

included in the share repurchases are repurchases of million of class b  including million and million of verisk class b and class b  respectively  which were not a part of the repurchase program 
a portion of the share redemptions in included in the total above was completed pursuant to the terms of the insurance service office  inc incentive plan  or the option plan 
we provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain qualifying active employees and retirees 
on january   we announced a hard freeze  which will eliminate all future compensation and service credits  to be instituted on february  to all participants in the pension plans 
based on the pension funding policy  we are required to contribute a minimum of approximately million to the pension plans in in addition  we are contemplating a voluntary prefunding to our qualified pension plan of an amount between million and million  which may occur in the first half of under the postretirement plan  we provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to qualifying participants  however  participants are required to pay a stated percentage of the premium coverage 
we expect to contribute approximately million to the postretirement plan in see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k

as of december   our credit facility had no outstanding borrowings and million of borrowing capacity was available 
the credit facility contains certain customary financial and other covenants that  among other things  impose certain restrictions on indebtedness  liens  investments  and capital expenditures 
these covenants also place restrictions on mergers  asset sales  sale leaseback transactions  payments between us and our subsidiaries  and certain transactions with affiliates 
the financial covenants require that  at the end of any fiscal quarter  we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least to and that during any period of four fiscal quarters  we maintain a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio below to we were in compliance with all debt covenants under the credit facility as of december  our credit facility at december  totaled million and on march   the northern trust company joined the credit facility to increase the capacity from million to million 
on march   we entered into amendments to our credit facility and our master shelf agreements to  among other things permit the issuance of the senior notes and guarantees noted above 
on october   we amended and restated the credit facility to increase the capacity from million to million  extended the credit facility through october  and named iso and verisk as co borrowers 
the amended credit agreement also resulted in a decrease in the applicable interest rates 
the interest rates for borrowing under the amended credit agreement will now be the applicable libor plus to  depending upon the result of certain ratios defined in the amended credit agreement 
on november   td bank joined the credit facility to increase the capacity from million to million 
we paid a one time commitment fee  which will be amortized over a five year period  which is consistent with the remaining life of the credit facility

other long term liabilities consist of our esop contributions and employee related deferred compensation plan 
we also have a deferred compensation plan for our board of directors  however  based on past performance and the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be paid  if any  we have excluded such amounts from the above table 
unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with asc  which have been omitted from the table above  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled  with the exception of those amounts subject to a statute of limitation 
related to the unrecognized tax benefits  we also have recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of million 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles 
table of contents generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  goodwill and intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefits  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  fees and or price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term  usually one year 
revenues from transaction based fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
the company also has term based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is post contract customer support or pcs  including unspecified upgrade rights on a when and if available basis 
the company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term 
the pcs associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term 
the company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include pcs and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term 
in addition  the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates  principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears 
in these instances  we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past 
differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 
we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past 
we invoice our customers in annual  quarterly  or monthly installments 
amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as fees received in advance on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met 
stock based compensation the fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of several estimates  including expected term  expected risk free interest rate  expected volatility and expected dividend yield 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the awards granted  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
option grants and restricted stock awards are expensed ratably over the four year vesting period 
we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january   which requires that stock based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service 
we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest 
the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 
prior to our ipo  the fair value of the common stock underlying the stock based compensation was determined quarterly on or about the final day of the quarter 
the valuation methodology was based on a variety 
table of contents of qualitative and quantitative factors including the nature of the business and history of the enterprise  the economic outlook in general  the condition of the specific industries in which we operate  the financial condition of the business  our ability to generate free cash flow  and goodwill or other intangible asset value 
prior to our ipo  the fair value of our common stock was determined using generally accepted valuation methodologies  including the use of the guideline company method 
this determination of fair market value employs both a comparable company analysis  which examines the valuation multiples of public companies deemed comparable  in whole or in part  to us and a discounted cash flow analysis that determines a present value of the projected future cash flows of the business 
the comparable companies are comprised of a combination of public companies in the financial services information and technology businesses 
these methodologies have been consistently applied since we regularly assess the underlying assumptions used in the valuation methodologies  including the comparable companies to be used in the analysis  the future forecasts of revenue and earnings  and the impact of market conditions on factors such as the weighted average cost of capital 
these assumptions are reviewed quarterly  with a more comprehensive evaluation performed annually 
for the comparable company analysis  the share price and financial performance of these comparables were updated quarterly based on the most recent public information 
our stock price was also impacted by the number of shares outstanding 
as the number of shares outstanding has declined over time  our share price has increased 
the determination of the fair value of our common stock required us to make judgments that were complex and inherently subjective 
if different assumptions are used in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 
goodwill and intangibles goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized 
intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable  using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets 
this testing compares carrying values to fair values and  when appropriate  the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value 
as of december   we had goodwill and net intangible assets of million  which represents of our total assets 
during fiscal year  we performed an impairment test as of june  and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary 
there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing  including an estimate of future expected revenues  earnings and cash flows  useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value 
we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units 
to mitigate undue influence  we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties 
the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinite lived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units 
changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill 
our valuation has not indicated any impairment of our goodwill asset of million as of december  for the year ended december   there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets 
pension and postretirement we account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
this standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other 
table of contents comprehensive income loss  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard 
certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans 
the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation  the expected return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases 
we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize quoted rates from long term bond indices  and changes in long term bond rates over the past year  cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees 
as part of our evaluation  we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans 
our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated aa or better at the measurement date 
the output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year s discount rate and quoted rates for long term bond indices 
for our pension plans at december   we determined this rate to be  a decrease of from the rate used at december  our postretirement rate is at december   a decrease of from the used at december  the expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader long term forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation  and the current economic environment 
our investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of debt securities and equity securities 
as of december   the plan assets were allocated debt  equity securities  and to other investments 
we have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan 
the expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category  considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit costs 
we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the rate of compensation increase is based on our long term plans for such increases 
the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december the future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy 
as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of  the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under medicare part d was effectively changed 
this legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan 
we are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted 
as a result  we recorded a non cash tax charge to the provision for income taxes of million as of december  on january   we announced a hard freeze  which will eliminate all future compensation and service credits  to be instituted on february  to all participants in the pension plans 
the freeze in will reduce the unfunded pension liability by approximately million and we will realize a curtailment gain of approximately million 

table of contents a one percent change in discount rate  future rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation would have the following effects pension post retirement decrease increase decrease increase in thousands benefit cost projected benefit obligation benefit cost projected benefit obligation benefit cost projected benefit obligation benefit cost projected benefit obligation discount rate expected rate on asset rate of compensation income taxes in projecting future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses 
the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions 
on january   we adopted accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of asc  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under this interpretation  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
as a result of the implementation of this interpretation  we recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million  which was accounted for as an increase to the january  balance of retained earnings accumulated deficit 
we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
as of december   we have gross federal  state  and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of million  which will expire at various dates from through such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows in thousands we estimate unrecognized tax positions of million that may be recognized by december   due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities  net of additional uncertain tax positions

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under our syndicated revolving credit facility  which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus to depending on certain ratios defined in the credit facility 
a change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts our pre tax income and cash flows  but does not impact the fair value of the instruments 
based on our overall interest rate exposure at december   a one percent change in interest rates would not result in a change in annual pretax interest expense based on our current level of borrowings
