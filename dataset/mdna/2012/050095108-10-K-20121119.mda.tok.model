item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial position at september  and  and our results of operations for each of the fiscal years for the three year period ended september   and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes in item of this form k 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under item a risk factors in this form k 
see forward looking statements 
market outlook overview our fiscal year financial and operating results include record operating revenues totaling million record net income of million diluted earnings per share of net cash from operating activities of million debt to capitalization ratio of at september  industry conditions the offshore drilling market continued to strengthen throughout fiscal year with all rig classes experiencing improved utilization levels in response to higher than average oil prices 
the ultra deepwater floater market has been the principal beneficiary of the strengthening market as evidenced by the relatively higher increase in day rates and near full utilization for this rig class during the year 
day rates for all other rig classes also experienced improvement  albeit at a slower pace 
the strength of the ultra deepwater market is also evidenced by an increase of newbuild rig construction orders since the beginning of the pace of rig orders  however  has recently slowed from the prior year as contract drilling companies navigate between disrupting long term supply and demand dynamics by adding additional newbuild rigs and growing their rig fleet at reasonable construction prices in a strong day rate environment 
the global macro environment  including the sovereign debt issues in europe and slower economic growth in the us  china and several developing countries  coupled with the uncertainty associated with us fiscal policy and economic recovery  create a high level of market volatility and threaten to disrupt favorable offshore drilling market conditions 
in addition  capacity constraints in the offshore rig equipment global supply chain and the shortage of skilled personnel are negatively impacting operating costs leading to margin compression in certain operating jurisdictions 
drilling activity in the us gulf of mexico is rebounding to pre macondo levels and the drilling permit approval process is now functioning capably 
however  we cannot be certain that this level of activity will continue into the future or that additional restrictions or regulations will not be implemented which might negatively impact drilling activity or the drilling permit approval process in the us gulf of mexico 
west africa  east africa and certain other deepwater and ultra deepwater frontiers are experiencing exploration success which is driving increased contract tender requests and awards at increasingly higher day rates 
further improvements in ultra deepwater and deepwater rig utilization and day rates will depend in large part on projected oil prices  the strength of the global economy  and any additional impacts from the macondo incident and associated new regulatory  legislative and permitting requirements 
ultra deepwater and deepwater rigs industry wide  deepwater rig utilization increased from at the end of fiscal year to currently  while ultra deepwater utilization remains at full utilization 
only eight newbuild floaters are available through the end of for calendar year  the vast majority of both ultra deepwater and deepwater available days are contracted for the respective industry wide fleets 
as of october   there were drillships and semisubmersibles under construction for delivery through january this includes ultra deepwater rigs to be constructed in shipyards located in brazil  all of which are under long term contracts with petrobras 
of the remaining ultra deepwater rigs under construction  are currently contracted  with several others under announced letters of intent 
the atwood condor began its month contract with hess corporation in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in the us gulf of mexico and is contracted through july the atwood osprey continued its six year commitment offshore australia with chevron australia and is contracted through the third quarter of fiscal year the atwood eagle and atwood falcon are contracted through the third quarter of fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal year  respectively  while the atwood hunter is contracted throughout fiscal year the atwood advantage and atwood achiever are dp dynamically positioned  dual derrick  ultra deepwater drillships rated to operate in water depths up to  feet  and are currently under construction at the daewoo shipbuilding and marine engineering co  ltd 
dsme shipyard in south korea 
these drillships will have enhanced technical capabilities  including two seven ram bops  three ton knuckle boom cranes  a ton active heave tree running knuckle boom crane and person accommodations 
the atwood advantage and atwood achiever are expected to be delivered during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and third quarter of fiscal  respectively  at a total cost  including project management  drilling  handling tools and spares  of approximately million each 
upon delivery from the shipyard  the atwood advantage will mobilize to the eastern mediterranean sea to commence a drilling program with noble which extends through the first quarter of fiscal year in september  we entered into a turnkey construction contract with dsme to construct a third ultra deepwater drillship  the atwood admiral  at the dsme yard in south korea 
the atwood admiral is expected to be delivered during the second quarter of fiscal year the design of the atwood admiral will be substantially identical to the previously ordered atwood advantage and atwood achiever 
in addition  we have until june  to exercise our option to build an additional ultra deepwater drillship with dsme 
at this time  we have made no determination as to whether that option will be exercised 
in determining whether to exercise the option we will consider several factors  including oil and gas prices  the magnitude of our contract drilling revenue backlog  the current and prospective supply and demand dynamics of the ultra deepwater drilling segment  current ultra deepwater contract day rates and newbuild drillship construction prices 
although we currently do not have drilling contracts for the atwood achiever or the atwood admiral  we expect that the long term demand for ultra deepwater drilling services in established and emerging basins should provide us with opportunities to contract these two rigs prior to their delivery dates 
jackup rigs the bifurcation in day rates and utilization continues to drive contracting activity in the jackup market 
currently  higher specification jackup rigs are achieving marketed utilization levels of approximately as compared to for the remainder of the global jackup fleet 
while higher specification rigs represent less than of the global jackup fleet  we expect the bifurcation trend to continue 
despite the expected increase in supply due to the continued delivery of high specification newbuild rigs through the end of next year  we expect that operators will continue to prefer contracting newer  more capable high specification jackups 
as a result of newbuild construction programs initiated during and continuing through  the jackup supply continues to increase 
as of october   there were newbuild jackup rigs under construction  of which are scheduled for delivery during the remainder of  are scheduled for delivery during and the remainder are scheduled for delivery thereafter 
approximately only of jackup rigs yet to be delivered are currently uncontracted  and approximately are not considered high specification rigs ie  less than foot water depth capability and therefore do not compete with the majority of our jackup fleet 
additionally  approximately rigs are capable of working year round in the north sea and offshore norway  and therefore are not directly competing with our jackup fleet 
the atwood mako and atwood manta are contracted through fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal year  while the atwood aurora and atwood beacon are contracted for and seven months in fiscal year  respectively 
the vicksburg is contracted through the end of the first fiscal quarter of due to market bifurcation for high specification jackups  we expect the atwood aurora and atwood beacon to continue to operate with high utilization and increasing day rates while the vicksburg may encounter greater competition resulting in lower utilization  with day rates remaining under pressure for the foreseeable future 
we currently have two pacific class jackup drilling units  the atwood manta and the atwood orca  similar in design to the atwood mako  under construction at the ppl shipyard pte 
ltd 
ppl shipyard in singapore 
these new rigs will have a rated water depth of feet  accommodations for personnel and significant offline handling features 
the rigs are each expected to cost approximately million  including project management  drilling  handling tools and spares  and are scheduled for delivery during the first and third quarters of fiscal year we currently do not have a drilling contract for the atwood orca  but we expect to contract this high specification rig prior to its delivery date 
idled rigs during fiscal year  we sold the richmond 
the atwood southern cross and seahawk remain idle 
we anticipate these two units will not return to service during fiscal year due to the lack of sufficient continuous demand  and thus  we are not actively marketing these rigs at this time 
contract backlog we maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues 
our contract backlog at september  was approximately billion  representing a increase compared to our contract backlog of billion at september  we calculate our contract backlog by multiplying the day rate under our drilling contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract  assuming full utilization 
the calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as for mobilization  demobilization  contract preparation  customer reimbursables and bonuses 
the amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different from amounts disclosed in our backlog calculations due to various factors  including unscheduled repairs  maintenance  weather and other factors 
such factors may result in lower applicable day rates than the full contractual day rate 
in addition  under certain circumstances  our customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate our contracts 
see item a  risk factors our business may experience reduced profitability if our customers terminate or seek to renegotiate our drilling contracts of this form k 
the following table sets forth as of september  the amount of our contract drilling revenue backlog and the percent of available operating days committed for our actively marketed drilling units for the periods indicated dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal and thereafter total contract drilling revenue backlog ultra deepwater and deepwater jackups percent of available operating days committed on october   we announced that one of our subsidiaries was awarded a drilling services contract by cec international  ltd 
for work in the gulf of thailand and offshore malaysia for the newbuild jackup atwood manta 
as a result of this contract  our contract backlog increased by approximately million and available operating days committed increased up to in fiscal year results of operations fiscal year versus fiscal year operating revenues revenues for fiscal year increased million  or  compared to the prior fiscal year 
a comparative analysis of revenues by rig for fiscal years and is as follows operating revenues in millions fiscal year fiscal year variance atwood condor atwood osprey atwood eagle atwood falcon atwood hunter atwood aurora atwood beacon atwood mako vicksburg other our newest ultra deepwater  semisubmersible drilling rig  the atwood condor  which commenced operations under its initial contract during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  earned mobilization revenue as it relocated from the shipyard in singapore to the us gulf of mexico 
the increase in revenues for the atwood osprey is due to the fact that the rig commenced drilling operations offshore australia in late may and thus did not earn a full year of revenue in fiscal year the rig continued on contract offshore australia for all of fiscal year revenues for the atwood eagle were relatively consistent compared to the prior fiscal year 
the rig worked offshore australia during both fiscal years and the decrease in revenues for the atwood falcon is due to the rig working on a long term contract offshore malaysia for all of fiscal year this contract ended during the second quarter of fiscal year from february through may  the rig underwent a shipyard project in singapore for upgrades 
following completion of such upgrades  the rig relocated to work offshore australia and began operations in late may that continued through the end of fiscal year the increase in revenues for the atwood hunter is primarily due to out of service time related to a planned regulatory inspection during fiscal year compared to no out of service time during fiscal year the atwood hunter worked offshore west africa during both fiscal years and revenues for the atwood aurora increased as the rig was fully utilized during fiscal year working offshore west africa 
in fiscal year  the rig worked offshore egypt until completion of its contract commitment in may the contract was followed by a planned shipyard project through june  after which the rig was idle for most of the fourth quarter of fiscal year until it resumed work under a contract that commenced in september revenues for the atwood beacon were relatively consistent compared to the prior fiscal year 
the rig continued to work offshore south america until the fourth quarter of fiscal year when it relocated to the mediterranean sea to prepare for drilling operations in israel 
our newest active jackup drilling unit  the atwood mako  was delivered from the shipyard and commenced drilling operations in september offshore thailand  and thus earned no revenue in fiscal year revenues for the vicksburg were relatively consistent compared to the prior fiscal year 
the vicksburg worked offshore thailand during both fiscal years and contract drilling costs contract drilling costs for fiscal year increased million  or  compared to the prior fiscal year 
a comparative analysis of contract drilling costs by rig for fiscal years and is as follows contract drilling costs in millions fiscal year fiscal year variance atwood condor atwood osprey atwood eagle atwood falcon atwood hunter atwood aurora atwood beacon atwood mako vicksburg other the atwood condor incurred costs as it relocated from the shipyard in singapore to the us gulf of mexico during the fourth quarter of fiscal year while on contract 
no drilling costs were incurred in fiscal year while the rig was under construction 
the atwood osprey commenced drilling operations in may  incurring approximately four months of drilling costs in fiscal year as compared to a full twelve months of drilling costs in fiscal year while working offshore australia 
contract drilling costs for the atwood eagle were relatively consistent as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the rig continued to work offshore australia during both fiscal years and the increase in contract drilling costs for the atwood falcon  as compared to the prior fiscal year  is primarily due to increased maintenance activities during the shipyard project from february to may and the subsequent commencement of drilling operations offshore australia which has significantly higher personnel costs than costs for its previous contract offshore malaysia 
the increase in contract drilling costs for the atwood hunter is due primarily to increased equipment related costs associated with maintenance projects and inspections as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in contract drilling costs for the atwood aurora  as compared to the prior fiscal year  is primarily attributable to increased costs for monthly amortization charges for mobilization to offshore west africa in the current fiscal year as well as lower operating expenses incurred at the end of fiscal year due to a planned shipyard project and substantial idle time prior to commencing its next contract offshore west africa 
the increase in contract drilling costs for the atwood beacon is primarily due to increased equipment related costs associated with maintenance projects and inspections incurred while the rig relocated from south america to the mediterranean sea during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the atwood mako was delivered from the shipyard and commenced drilling operations in thailand in september no drilling costs were incurred in fiscal year while the rig was under construction 
the increase in contract drilling costs for the vicksburg is attributable to increased equipment related costs associated with maintenance projects when compared to the prior fiscal year 
other contract drilling costs were relatively consistent with the prior fiscal year 
depreciation depreciation expense for the fiscal year increased million  or  compared to the prior fiscal year 
a comparative analysis of depreciation expense by rig for fiscal years and is as follows depreciation expense in millions fiscal year fiscal year variance atwood condor atwood osprey atwood eagle atwood falcon atwood hunter atwood aurora atwood beacon atwood mako vicksburg other the atwood condor  which was placed into service at the beginning of july  incurred no depreciation expense in fiscal year the atwood osprey  which was placed into service in late may  incurred only four months of depreciation expense in fiscal year the increase in depreciation for the atwood falcon is due to certain upgrades made to the rig during the shipyard project which was completed in may the atwood mako  which was placed into service at the beginning of september  incurred no depreciation expense in fiscal year depreciation expense for all other rigs remained relatively consistent during fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased approximately million  or  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher personnel related costs resulting from an increase in headcount to support our larger fleet 
other  net the decrease in other expenses is primarily due to a million charge related to an impairment of certain of our idled equipment during fiscal year income taxes our effective tax rate was for fiscal year  as compared to the prior fiscal year effective tax rate of 
the lower effective income tax was primarily due to the favorable resolution of prior period tax examinations 
fiscal year versus fiscal year operating revenues revenues for fiscal year decreased million  or  compared to fiscal year a comparative analysis of revenues by rig for fiscal years and is as follows operating revenues in millions fiscal year fiscal year variance atwood osprey atwood eagle atwood falcon atwood hunter atwood aurora atwood beacon vicksburg other the atwood osprey commenced drilling operations in late may offshore australia  and thus  earned no revenue in fiscal year revenues for the atwood eagle and atwood falcon were relatively consistent compared to fiscal year the atwood eagle continued to work offshore australia during both fiscal years and and the atwood falcon continued work on a long term contract offshore malaysia during both fiscal years and the decrease in revenues for the atwood hunter is due to an increase in downtime related to unplanned repairs and maintenance and a planned regulatory inspection during fiscal year the atwood hunter worked offshore west africa in fiscal years and the increase in revenues for the atwood beacon is due to working on a higher day rate contract offshore south america compared to the fiscal year when the rig was working at a lower day rate offshore west africa 
revenues for the atwood aurora decreased during fiscal year due to the completion of its contract commitment in may  which was followed by a planned shipyard project through june following the shipyard project  the rig was idled for most of the fourth quarter of fiscal year the rig experienced virtually no downtime during the fiscal year in fiscal year  until the time of the shipyard project  the rig worked offshore egypt on the same long term contract that it worked under during fiscal year the atwood aurora resumed drilling operations offshore west africa under a new contract that commenced late september revenues for the vicksburg were relatively consistent compared to the fiscal year the vicksburg worked offshore thailand during both fiscal years and decreases in other operating revenues during fiscal year are due to the atwood southern cross  richmond  and seahawk all completing their respective drilling contracts and subsequently being idled 
the idled state of these rigs resulted in the decrease of revenues for fiscal year compared to fiscal year contract drilling costs contract drilling costs for fiscal year decreased million  or  compared to fiscal year a comparative analysis of contract drilling costs by rig for fiscal years and is as follows contract drilling costs in millions fiscal year fiscal year variance atwood osprey atwood eagle atwood falcon atwood hunter atwood aurora atwood beacon vicksburg other the atwood osprey  commenced drilling operations in late may  incurring approximately four months of drilling costs in fiscal year compared to none in fiscal year the increase in contract drilling costs for the atwood eagle for fiscal year compared to fiscal year is attributable to higher local payroll and payroll related costs due to the strengthening of the australian dollar along with increased equipment related costs due to contract specific enhancements and additional maintenance projects performed during the extended regulatory inspection period during fiscal year contract drilling costs for the atwood falcon  atwood hunter  and the atwood beacon were relatively consistent when compared to fiscal year the decrease in contract drilling costs for the atwood aurora for fiscal year compared to fiscal year is due to lower operating expenses being incurred during a planned shipyard project in may and june and the idle time incurred during the remainder of fiscal year contract drilling costs for the vicksburg were relatively consistent when compared to fiscal year decreases in other contract drilling costs during fiscal year are due to reduced operating costs for the richmond  atwood southern cross and seahawk as a result of these rigs being idled and not being actively marketed 
the decreases are also due to a combination of higher percentage of other contract drilling costs allocated to rig contract drilling costs in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year and recognition of foreign exchange gains in fiscal year compared to foreign exchange losses in fiscal year depreciation depreciation expense for fiscal year increased million  or  as compared to fiscal year a comparative analysis of depreciation expense by rig for fiscal years and is as follows depreciation expense in millions fiscal year fiscal year variance atwood osprey atwood eagle atwood falcon atwood hunter atwood aurora atwood beacon vicksburg other the atwood osprey  which was placed into service in late may  incurred no depreciation expense in fiscal year depreciation expense for all other rigs remained relatively consistent during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year general and administrative general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased approximately million  or  compared to the fiscal year primarily due to rising personnel costs resulting  in part  from various expenses related to the transition of executive leadership  wage increases and increased annual bonus and share based compensation costs during fiscal year other  net the increase in other expenses is primarily due to a million charge related to an impairment of certain of our idled equipment during fiscal year the other category amounts for fiscal year were attributable to the sale of equipment during the year 
income taxes our effective tax rate was for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year effective tax rate of 
the lower effective income tax was primarily due to lower taxes on foreign earned income 
liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures totaled million for fiscal year capital expenditures and working capital needs were funded by cash flows from operations of approximately million  a net increase in our long term debt of million  and cash on hand from the prior fiscal year end 
although our net income for fiscal year was relatively consistent with the prior fiscal year  our cash flows from operations of million decreased million as compared to approximately million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase of accounts receivable is attributable to higher revenue levels and a higher number of active in service rigs at the current fiscal year end when compared to the prior fiscal year end 
although our cash and cash equivalents decreased to million as of september  from million as of september   our working capital only decreased to million from million for the same fiscal year end periods 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable as mentioned above  an increase in inventory due to more active in service rigs and a decrease in accounts payable due to a reduction of accrued but unpaid invoices related to our construction projects when compared to prior fiscal year end 
to date  general inflationary trends have not had a material effect on our operating revenues or expenses 
revolving credit facility as of september   we had million of outstanding borrowings under our five year million senior secured revolving credit facility 
including the million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes  we had a total debt to capitalization ratio of 
our wholly owned subsidiary  atwood offshore worldwide limited aowl  is the borrower under the credit facility  and we and certain of our other subsidiaries are guarantors under the facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the eurodollar rate plus a margin of 
certain borrowings effectively bear interest at a fixed rate due to our interest rate swaps 
the average interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility was approximately per annum at september   after considering the impact of our interest rate swaps 
the credit facility also provides for the issuance  when required  of standby letters of credit 
the credit facility has a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the underlying commitment 
as of september   we had standby letters of credit issued in the aggregate amount of million 
as of november   an additional million had been borrowed under our facility subsequent to september   leaving million of available borrowing capacity under the facility 
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent and the agreement by the lenders  the credit facility includes an accordion feature which  if exercised  will increase total commitments by up to million  bringing the total commitment to billion 
the credit facility contains various financial covenants that impose a maximum leverage ratio of to  a debt to capitalization ratio of to  a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of to and a minimum collateral maintenance of of the aggregate amount outstanding under the credit facility 
in addition  the credit facility contains limitations on our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur liens  merge  consolidate or sell substantially all assets  pay dividends including restrictions on aowl s ability to pay dividends to us  incur additional indebtedness  make advances  investments or loans  and transact with affiliates 
the credit facility also contains customary events of default  including but not limited to delinquent payments  bankruptcy filings  material adverse judgments  guarantees or security documents not being in full effect  non compliance with the employee retirement income security act of  cross defaults under other debt agreements  or a change of control 
the credit facility is secured primarily by first preferred mortgages on six of our active drilling units the atwood aurora  the atwood beacon  the atwood eagle  the atwood falcon  the atwood hunter  and the atwood osprey  as well as liens on the equity interests of our subsidiaries that own  directly or indirectly  such drilling units 
in addition  if we exercise the accordion feature and increase the total commitments  the credit facility requires that we provide a first preferred mortgage on the atwood condor  the atwood mako and the atwood manta  as well as a lien on the equity interests of our subsidiaries that own  directly or indirectly  such rigs 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit facility at september  senior notes in january  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes 
we received net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses  of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds to reduce outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
the notes are our senior unsecured obligations and are not currently guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries 
interest is payable on the notes semi annually in arrears 
the indenture governing the notes contains provisions that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  sell assets  make investments  create liens  enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us  and consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
many of these restrictions will terminate if the notes become rated investment grade 
the indenture governing the notes also contains customary events of default  including payment defaults  defaults for failure to comply with other covenants in the indenture  cross acceleration and entry of final judgments in excess of million  and certain events of bankruptcy  in certain cases subject to notice and grace periods 
we are required to offer to repurchase the notes in connection with specified change in control events or with excess proceeds of asset sales not applied for permitted purposes 
at any time prior to february   we may  on any one or more occasions  redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price set forth in the indenture governing the notes 
at any time prior to february   we may  on any one or more occasions  redeem the notes in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a make whole premium 
on and after february   we may  on any one or more occasions  redeem the notes in whole or in part at the redemption price set forth in the indenture governing the notes 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures  including maintenance capital expenditures  for fiscal year totaled million 
we estimate that our total capital expenditures for fiscal year will be approximately million  substantially all of which is contractually committed 
these capital expenditures are expected to be funded with existing cash balances on hand  cash flows from operations and additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as of september   we had expended approximately million on our five drilling units under construction at such time 
the expected remaining costs for our five drilling units under construction are as follows in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal total we believe that we will be able to fund all additional construction costs with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which has provisions to increase the total commitment to billion as described above 
other from time to time  we may seek possible expansion and acquisition opportunities relating to our business  which may include the construction or acquisition of rigs or other businesses in addition to those described in this form k 
such determinations will depend on market conditions and opportunities existing at that time  including with respect to the market for drilling contracts and day rates and the relative costs associated with such expansions or acquisitions 
the timing  success or terms of any such efforts and the associated capital commitments are not currently known 
in addition to cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  we may seek to access the capital markets to fund such opportunities 
our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors  including  among others  our credit rating  industry conditions  general economic conditions  market conditions and market perceptions of us and our industry 
in addition  we continually review the possibility of disposing of assets that we do not consider core to our long term business plan 
in addition  in the future  we may seek to redeploy our assets to more active regions if we have the opportunity to do so on attractive terms 
we frequently bid for or negotiate with customers regarding multi year contracts that could require significant capital expenditures and mobilization costs 
we expect to fund these opportunities primarily with cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments in thousands as of september  fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal and thereafter total debt and interest purchase commitments operating leases amounts include principal payments on the notes and credit facility  fixed interest payments on the notes and swaps assuming september  libor for floating rate  and short term notes payable 
includes commitments related to our five drilling units under construction as of september  we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the leases 
our future operating lease payments would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
critical accounting policies significant accounting policies are included in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended september  these policies  along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by management in their application  have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we identify our most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations  and that require the most difficult  subjective and or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition  property and equipment  impairment of assets  income taxes  and employee stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we account for contract drilling revenue in accordance with the terms of the underlying drilling contract 
these contracts generally provide that revenue is earned and recognized on a daily rate ie day rate basis  and day rates are typically earned for a particular level of service over the life of a contract 
day rate contracts can be performed for a specified period of time or the time required to drill a specified well or number of wells 
revenues from day rate drilling operations  which are classified under contract drilling services  are recognized on a per day basis as services are performed assuming collectability is reasonably assured 
deferred fees and costs fees received as compensation for the relocating drilling rigs from one major operating area to another  equipment and upgrade costs reimbursed by the customer  as well as receipt of advance billings of day rates are recognized as earned during the expected term of the related drilling contract  as are the day rates associated with such contracts 
however  fees received upon termination of a drilling contract are generally recognized as earned during the period termination occurs as the termination fee is usually conditional based on the occurrence of an event as defined in the drilling contract  such as not obtaining follow on work to the contract in progress or relocation beyond a certain distance when the contract is completed 
if receipt of such fees are not conditional  they will be recognized as earned on a straight line method over the expected term of the related drilling contract 
we defer the mobilization costs relating to moving a drilling rig to a new area  which are incurred prior to the commencement of the drilling operations and customer requested equipment purchases that will revert to the customer at the end of the applicable drilling contract 
we amortize such costs on a straight line basis over the expected term of the applicable drilling contract 
contract revenues and drilling costs are reported in the consolidated statements of operations at their gross amounts 
property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost  reduced by provisions to recognize economic impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
at september   the carrying value of our property and equipment totaled approximately billion  which represents approximately of our total assets 
the carrying value reflects the application of our property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate estimates  assumptions and judgments by management relative to the useful lives and salvage values of our units 
once rigs and related equipment are placed in service  they are depreciated on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  with depreciation discontinued only during the period when a drilling unit is out of service while undergoing a significant upgrade that extends its useful life 
the estimated useful lives of our drilling units and related equipment can range from years to years and our salvage values are generally estimated at of capitalized costs 
any future increases or decreases in our estimates of useful lives or salvage values will have the effect of decreasing or increasing future depreciation expense  respectively 
we periodically evaluate our property and equipment to determine whether their net carrying value is in excess of their net realizable value 
in determining an asset s fair value  these evaluations are performed considering a number of factors such as estimated future cash flows  appraisals and current market value analysis 
assets are written down to their fair value if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
operations of our drilling equipment are subject to the offshore drilling requirements of oil and gas exploration and production companies and agencies of foreign governments 
these requirements are  in turn  subject to fluctuations in government policies  world demand and price for petroleum products  proved reserves in relation to such demand and the extent to which such demand can be met from onshore sources 
the critical estimates which result from these dynamics include projected utilization  day rates  and operating expenses  each of which impacts our estimated future cash flows 
over the last ten years  our equipment utilization rate has averaged approximately  however  if a drilling unit incurs significant idle time or receives day rates below operating costs  its carrying value could become impaired 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments used by management in the application of our property and equipment and asset impairment policies reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments  especially those involving the useful lives of our rigs and vessels and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations  would likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 
income taxes we conduct operations and earn income in numerous foreign countries and are subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries  as well as united states federal and state tax laws 
at september   we have an approximate million net deferred income tax liability 
this balance reflects the application of our income tax accounting policies 
such accounting policies incorporate estimates  assumptions and judgments by management relative to the interpretation of applicable tax laws  the application of accounting standards  and future levels of taxable income 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments used by management in connection with accounting for income taxes reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations 
changes in these estimates  assumptions and judgments could result in materially different provisions for deferred and current income taxes 
a comprehensive model is used to account for uncertain tax positions  which includes consideration of how we recognize  measure  present and disclose uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on a tax return 
the income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our tax positions that can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
share based compensation share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant

an entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
an entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
we will adopt the accounting standards effective january  we do not expect that our adoption will have a material effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
interest rate risk the provisions of our credit facility provide for a variable interest rate cost on our million outstanding as of september  however  we employ an interest rate risk management strategy that utilizes derivative instruments with respect to million of our debt as of september  in order to minimize or eliminate unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows arising from changes in  and volatility of  interest rates 
effectively  only million of our variable long term debt outstanding as of september  is subject to changes in interest rates 
thus  a change in the interest rate on the floating rate debt would have an immaterial impact on our annual earnings and cash flows 
foreign currency risk as a multinational company  we conduct business in numerous foreign countries 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
certain of our subsidiaries have monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than our functional currency 
based on september  amounts  a decrease in the value of in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar would not have a material effect to our annual earnings and cash flows 
we did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at september  market risk our notes bear interest at a fixed interest rate whose fair value will fluctuate based on changes in prevailing market interest rates and market perceptions of our credit risk 
the fair value of our notes was approximately million at september   compared to the carrying amount of million 
if prevailing market interest rates had been lower at september   the change in fair value of our notes  would have been immaterial
