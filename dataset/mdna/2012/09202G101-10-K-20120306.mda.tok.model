because the company had no operations at the time of our acquisition of black diamond equipment  black diamond equipment is considered to be our predecessor company the predecessor for financial reporting purposes see note of our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed explanation of the acquisition

on january   the company changed its name from clarus corporation to black diamond  inc  which we believe more accurately reflects our current business 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based on the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to derivatives  revenue recognition  income taxes  stock based compensation  and valuation of long lived assets  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies include the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
we use derivative instruments to hedge currency rate movements on foreign currency denominated sales 
we enter into forward contracts  option contracts and non deliverable forwards to manage the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on a portion of our forecasted sales denominated in foreign currencies 
these derivatives are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets in other assets and accrued liabilities 
changes in fair value of the derivatives not designated as hedge instruments are included in the determination of net income 
for derivative contracts designated as hedge instruments  the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the instruments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the period the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings 
we use operating budgets and cash flow forecasts to estimate future sales and to determine the level and timing of derivative transactions intended to mitigate such sales in accordance with our risk management policies 
if the forecasted sales levels are not reached  our derivative instruments may be deemed to be not effective which may result in foreign currency gains and losses being recorded in our statement of operations  which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
we sell our products pursuant to customer orders or sales contracts entered into with our customers 
revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer and when collectability is reasonably assured 
charges for shipping and handling fees are included in net sales and the corresponding shipping and handling expenses are included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
at the time of revenue recognition  we also provide for estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues 
the estimates are based on historical rates of product returns and claims 
however  actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from these estimates 
if actual or expected returns and claims are significantly greater or lower than the reserves that we have established  we will record a reduction or increase to sales in the period in which we make such a determination 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
the asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our uncertain tax positions 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conductions by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could cause our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes to be inaccurate 
changes in any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
compensation expense is recorded for all share based awards granted based on the fair value of the award at the time of the grant and is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
we estimate stock based compensation for stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires various highly subjective assumptions  including volatility and expected option life 
further  we estimate forfeitures for stock based awards granted  which are not expected to vest 
if any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
our depreciation policies for property and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value  if any 
our amortization policies for intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets 
we review property and definite lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
we test for possible impairment at the asset or asset group level  which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
we measure recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the total of undiscounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value of the asset  there is no impairment charge 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we estimate the fair value of the asset based on the present value of its future cash flows and recognize an impairment charge for the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting of trademarks  and goodwill are not subject to amortization 
rather  we evaluate those assets for possible impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of an asset may exceed its fair value 
fair value of an indefinite lived trademark intangible asset is based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method 
under this method  forecasted revenues for a trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark in lieu of ownership from an independent party  and fair value is the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark 
if the fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value  there is no impairment charge 
if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 
we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill by making a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the company is less than its carrying value 
if we are able to support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the company is less than its carrying value  it is not required to perform the two step impairment test 
otherwise  using the two step approach is required 
in the first step of the goodwill impairment test  we compare the carrying value the company  including its recorded goodwill  to the estimated fair value 
we estimate the fair value using an equity value based and enterprise value based methodology 
the principal method used is an equity value based method in which the company s market cap is compared to the net book value 
in the enterprise value based method  the fair value of the company is estimated by taking its market cap plus interest bearing debt  which equals the enterprise value 
this value is then compared to total assets  less non interest bearing debt 
if the fair value of the company exceeds its carrying value  the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required 
however  if the fair value of the business unit is less than its carrying value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment charge  if any 
the second step involves a hypothetical allocation of the fair value of the company to its net tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill as if the business unit were newly acquired  which results in an implied fair value of goodwill 
the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in general  we can be exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices  and that can affect the cost of operating  investing and financing under those conditions 
the company believes it has moderate exposure to these risks 
we assess market risk based on changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and commodity prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change in these rates and prices 
interest rate risks our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our  unsecured revolving credit facility the loan 
we have cash flow exposure on the loan since the interest is indexed to libor 
as of december   the applicable interest rate for the outstanding borrowings under the loan was 
foreign currency risk while we transact business predominantly in us dollars and most of our revenues are collected in us dollars  a portion of our operating costs are denominated in other currencies 
changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the us dollar will affect our sales and profitability and could result in exchange losses 
for the year ending december   approximately of our sales were denominated in foreign currencies  the most significant of which were the euro  british pound  norwegian kroner  swiss franc and canadian dollar 
the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales 
a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a material effect on foreign currency gains and losses related to the foreign currency derivatives or the net fair value of the company s foreign currency derivatives 
derivative instrument risk we employ a variety of practices to manage these market risks  including operating and financing activities and  where deemed appropriate  the use of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading 
derivatives are such that a specific debt instrument  contract  or anticipated purchase determines the amount  maturity  and other specifics of the hedge 
if a derivative contract is entered into  we either determine that it is an economic hedge or we designate the derivative as a cash flow or fair value hedge 
we do not hold derivative financial investments  derivative commodity investments  engage in foreign currency hedging or other transactions that expose us to material market risk
