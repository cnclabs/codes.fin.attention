table of contents overview the company operates in one business segment as an independent provider of ems  which includes printed circuit board assemblies and completely assembled box build electronic products 
in connection with the production of assembled products  the company also provides services to its customers  including automatic and manual assembly and testing of products  material sourcing and procurement  design  manufacturing and test engineering support  warehousing and shipment services  and assistance in obtaining product approval from governmental and other regulatory bodies 
the company provides these manufacturing services through an international network of facilities located in the united states  mexico  china and taiwan 
on may   sigmatron acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of spitfire 
spitfire is a privately held illinois corporation headquartered in carpentersville  illinois with captive manufacturing sites in chihuahua  mexico and suburban ho chi minh city  vietnam 
both manufacturing sites were among the assets acquired by the company 
spitfire was an original equipment manufacturer of electronic controls  with a focus on the major appliance white goods industry 
although north america is currently its primary market  spitfire has applications that can be used worldwide 
providing manufacturing solutions for spitfire since  sigmatron has been a strategic partner to spitfire as it developed its oem electronic controls business 
spitfire provides cost effective designs as control solutions for its customers  primarily in high volume applications of domestic cooking ranges  dishwashers  refrigerators  and portable appliances 
spitfire is a member of the association of home appliance manufacturers aham  as well as other industry related trade associations and is iso certified 
in addition  spitfire s design capabilities will allow the company to offer design services for the first time in specific markets 
the company relies on numerous third party suppliers for components used in the company s production process 
certain of these components are available only from single sources or a limited number of suppliers 
in addition  a customer s specifications may require the company to obtain components from a single source or a small number of suppliers 
the loss of any such suppliers could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
further  the company could operate at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from suppliers 
the company does not enter into long term purchase agreements with major or single source suppliers 
the company believes that short term purchase orders with its suppliers provides flexibility  given that the company s orders are based on the changing needs of its customers 
sales can be a misleading indicator of the company s financial performance 
sales levels can vary considerably among customers and products depending on the type of services consignment versus turnkey rendered by the company and the demand by customers 
consignment orders require the company to perform manufacturing services on components and other materials supplied by a customer  and the company charges only for its labor  overhead and manufacturing costs  plus a profit 
in the case of turnkey orders  the company provides  in addition to manufacturing services  the components and other materials used in assembly 
turnkey contracts  in general  have a higher dollar volume of sales for each given assembly  owing to inclusion of the cost of components and other materials in net sales and cost of goods sold 
variations in the number of turnkey orders compared to consignment orders can lead to significant fluctuations in the company s revenue and gross margin levels 
consignment orders accounted for less than of the company s revenues for the year ended april  in an effort to facilitate growth of our china operation  the company established a new chinese entity in october that allows the company to provide services competitively to the domestic market in china 
nonetheless  during fiscal year  the company continued to see a trend of chinese costs increasing  thereby making mexico a more competitive manufacturing location to service north america 
indications suggest that this trend will continue 
we feel the company s international footprint provides our customers with flexibility within the company to manufacture in china or mexico or both 
we believe this strategy has continued to serve the company well during these difficult economic times as its customers continuously evaluate their supply chain strategies 

table of contents in the past  the timing of production and delivery of orders  primarily at the instance of its customers  has caused the company to experience significant quarterly fluctuations in its revenues and earnings 
the uncertainty associated with the worldwide economy in general  and the united states economy specifically  makes forecasting difficult 
short term customer demands remain volatile 
the company continued to experience pricing pressures from both its customer and suppliers and its margins continued to be reduced in fiscal the company expects continuing pressure on margins until the economy starts a sustained recovery 
the company is hopeful to see that start during fiscal year until that time  the company will manage its cost structure 
we will also work on integrating spitfire into sigmatron  which the company believes will ultimately improve our economies of scale and provide new revenue opportunities 
due to the acquisition of spitfire  effective june   the company will discontinue selling to spitfire 
the company will instead begin selling directly to spitfires customers 
on may   the company entered into a real estate lease agreement to relocate its tijuana  mx operation to a new facility within tijuana  mx 
the current lease expired june and the company began its relocation in june the relocation was completed in july the company will incur expenses due to the relocation of its tijuana  mx operation  which are estimated to be  to  unaudited 
these expenses will be recorded in the first fiscal quarter of all incentives realized under the lease will be recognized over the term of the lease  which is five years 
critical accounting policies management estimates and uncertainties the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements include depreciation and amortization periods  the allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for inventory and valuation of long lived assets 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenues from sales of the company s electronic manufacturing services business are recognized when the finished good product is shipped to the customer 
in general  and except for consignment inventory  it is the company s policy to recognize revenue and related costs when the finished goods have been shipped from its facilities  which is also the same point that title passes under the terms of the purchase order 
finished goods inventory for certain customers is shipped from the company to an independent warehouse for storage or shipped directly to the customer and stored in a segregated part of the customer s own facility 
upon the customer s request for finished goods inventory  the inventory is shipped to the customer if the inventory was stored off site  or transferred from the segregated part of the customer s facility for consumption or use by the customer 
the company recognizes revenue upon such shipment or transfer 
the company does not earn a fee for such arrangements 
the company from time to time may ship finished goods from its facilities  which is also the same point that title passes under the terms of the purchase order  and invoice the customer at the end of the calendar month 
this is done only in special circumstances to accommodate a specific customer 
further  from time to time customers request the company hold finished goods after they have been invoiced to consolidate finished goods for shipping purposes 
the company generally provides a day warranty for workmanship only and does not have any installation  acceptance or sales incentives although the company has negotiated longer warranty terms in certain instances 
the company assembles and tests assemblies based on customers specifications 
historically  the amount of returns for workmanship issues has been de minimis under the company s standard or extended warranties 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
in the event of an inventory write down  the company records expense to state the inventory at lower of cost or market 
the company establishes inventory reserves for valuation  shrinkage  and excess and obsolete inventory 
the company records provisions for inventory shrinkage based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss 
actual results differing from these estimates could significantly affect the 
table of contents company s inventories and cost of products sold 
the company records provisions for excess and obsolete inventories for the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
actual product demand or market conditions could be different than that projected by management 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flow the asset is expected to generate 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
income tax the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  income taxes 
our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
the company is subject to income taxes in both the us and several foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates by management are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense assessment 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  the company considers all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  the company begins with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies  and incorporates assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment and estimates by management about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  the company considers three years of cumulative operating income and or loss 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not presently aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
fasb asc topic  income taxes provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
asc topic also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the company recognizes tax liabilities in accordance with asc topic and the company adjusts these liabilities when its judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
new accounting standards in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
for updated revenue recognition guidance under the provisions of asc  multiple element arrangements 
the previous guidance has been retained for criteria to determine when delivered items in a multiple deliverable arrangements should be considered separate units of accounting  however the updated guidance removes the 
table of contents previous separation criterion that objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any undelivered items must exist for the delivered items to be considered a separate unit or separate units of accounting 
this guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after july  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in march  the fasb issued asu  scope exception related to embedded credit derivatives to address questions that have been raised in practice about the intended breadth of the embedded credit derivative scope exception in paragraphs through of asc  derivatives and hedging 
the amended guidance clarifies that the scope exception applies to contracts that contain an embedded credit derivative that is only in the form of subordination of one financial instrument to another

the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  which results in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
consequently  the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   which was first applicable to the company s fiscal quarter beginning february  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic  presentation of comprehensive income  which requires disclosure of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
asu became effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  in december  the fasb has issued asu  comprehensive income topic  that deferred the requirement to separately present within net income reclassification adjustments of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company adopted this guidance beginning february  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles  goodwill and other topic  testing goodwill for impairment revised topic 
the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
the revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted this guidance beginning february  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition
