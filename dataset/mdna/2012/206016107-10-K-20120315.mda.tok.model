item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto located elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  develop  market and promote innovative solutions in women s healthcare 
our proprietary product is the essure permanent birth control procedure  which is the most effective non surgical permanent birth control available 
the essure procedure delivers a soft and flexible insert into a woman s fallopian tubes  causing a benign tissue in growth which blocks the fallopian tubes 
successfully placed essure inserts and the subsequent tissue growth around and through the inserts prohibits the egg from traveling through the fallopian tube  preventing conception 
the effectiveness rate of the essure procedure as determined in our clinical study is after four years of follow up 
we obtained approval to market the essure procedure in the european union in february and obtained the us food and drug administration fda  approval for the essure procedure in november approximately  women worldwide have undergone the essure procedure 
we sell the essure procedure directly in france through our wholly owned subsidiary  conceptus sas sas  and in the united kingdom through our wholly owned subsidiary conceptus medical limited cml 
in october  we purchased certain assets of sigma medical and established a wholly owned subsidiary in the netherlands  conceptus bv bv 
in the rest of the world  we sell indirectly through a network of distributors 
effective october   the ministry of health in france issued new controls for reimbursement on hysteroscopic sterilization 
these new controls changed reimbursement to permit coverage only for woman and over  which impacted our business in france 
we are currently working to overturn this change  but are unable to predict whether our efforts will be successful 
during  we received a positive review from the national institute for health and clinical excellence in the united kingdom recognizing the efficacy and safety of the essure procedure 
in addition we have been working closely with department of health doh to appropriately fund the adoption of hysteroscopic sterilization 
through these efforts the doh has selected the essure procedure as one of the innovative technologies that qualifies for the payment by results program 
this represents a significant increase in reimbursement for the essure procedure hysteroscopic sterilization  raising the rate from approximately per procedure in to a new reimbursement rate of  this new reimbursement rate will take effect on april  in february  we received ce mark approval to use transvaginal ultrasound tvu  to confirm proper placement of the essure inserts three months following the essure procedure 
tvu is an alternative confirmation test to the standard flat plate pelvic x ray  and both tests are included in the european physicians instruction for use 
in addition  we are proceeding with our us tvu study and expect to be fully enrolled within the second half of the tvu confirmation test  if approved in the united states  would offer this less invasive in office alternative to the hsg confirmation test for patients 
in january  we announced our decision to discontinue our promotion of the gynecare thermachoice uterine balloon therapy system and reduced our workforce by approximately  primarily in the us field sales organization  in order to focus our sales efforts on growing the essure business 
we operate in one business segment 
net sales information based on geographic regions is provided in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting estimates and policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenue and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements in item an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  income taxes  stock based compensation  convertible senior notes  allowance for doubtful accounts  cash  cash equivalents  and investments  warranty  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  and contingent liabilities 
revenue recognition our revenue is primarily comprised of the sale of our essure procedure 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification asc asc revenue recognition 
under this standard  the following four criteria must be met in order to recognize revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  our selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the four revenue recognition criteria are applied to our sales as described in the following paragraphs 
we recognize revenues from our essure procedure when title to the product and the risk of loss transfers to an external customer 
we do not accept returns of the essure procedure 
we obtain written authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and the price is not dependent on actual essure procedures performed 
for sales through distributors we recognize revenues from our essure procedure when title to the product and the risk of loss transfers to the distributor 
our distributors are responsible for all marketing  sales  training 
table of contents and warranty for the essure procedure in their respective territories 
our standard terms and conditions do not provide price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our distributors 
in addition  our distributor agreements do not allow the distributor to return or exchange the essure procedure and the distributor is obligated to pay us for the sale regardless of their ability to resell the product 
additionally  we require physicians to be preceptored between and cases by a certified trainer before being able to perform the procedure independently 
there are no revenues associated with the training activities 
we do not charge a fee for the activity and no commitment arises for the physician from the preceptorship 
physician training is provided upfront and we have no obligation subsequent to the initial training 
training obligations have not been significant from inception to date 
we assess the credit worthiness of all customers in connection with their purchases 
we only recognize revenue when collectability is reasonably assured 
certain sales of our essure procedure may include delivery of additional items 
these obligations may be fulfilled after shipment of the essure procedure  and in these cases  we recognize revenue in accordance with the multiple element accounting guidance set forth in asc revenue multiple element arrangements 
in addition  multiple deliverable revenue arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
we apply a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which includes vendor specific objective evidence  if available  third party evidence  if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  and estimated selling price if neither vendor specific nor third party evidence is available 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
as of december   we had total net deferred tax assets of million consisting primarily of favorable temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had a total valuation allowance of million against certain state and foreign deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance against the state deferred tax assets is attributable to a portion of california net operating losses that are projected to expire prior to utilization 
in the united states  there was a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets throughout most of we released the valuation allowance on our us federal and certain states deferred tax assets on december  we evaluate the likelihood of the realization of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis  and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not more likely than not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings by jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  the carryforward periods available to utilize tax attributes and other relevant factors 
we believe that the us federal  state  and foreign tax attributes that have been recognized will be more likely than not realized within their available carry forward periods 
future changes in these factors  including our anticipated results  could have a significant impact on the realization of the deferred tax assets which would result in an increase to the valuation allowance and a corresponding charge to income tax expense 
we will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances in the future 

table of contents stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of asc compensation stock compensation  using the modified prospective transition method 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured on the grant date  based on the fair value of the award which is computed using the black scholes option valuation model  and is recognized as expense over the employee requisite service period 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model with the weighted average assumptions shown in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based award and the stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based compensation represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our stock based compensation expense could have been materially different 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be materially different 
the expected term of the options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the risk free interest rate for periods equal to the estimated life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
convertible senior notes we account for our notes in accordance with asc derivative and hedging 
in this regard  our convertible debt and net share settlement feature does not fall under the category of a derivative  and consequently  we classify our convertible debt as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
our convertible hedge and our outstanding warrants are accounted as set forth by asc  through which we record the convertible hedge transaction and the warrants in additional paid in capital 
subsequent changes in fair value of the agreement are not recognized 
we adopted asc debt with conversion and other options asc in the first quarter of fiscal the effect of the adoption of asc was to bifurcate the debt and equity components of our notes 
we account for our notes in accordance with asc asc clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement at our election 
asc specifies that an issuer of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity 
the amount recorded as debt is based on the fair value of the debt component as a standalone instrument  determined using an average interest rate for similar nonconvertible debt issued by entities with credit ratings comparable to ours at the time of issuance 
the difference between the debt recorded at inception and its principal amount is to be accreted to principal through interest expense through the estimated life of the note 
allowance for doubtful accounts we assess the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis in order to mitigate the risk of loss from customers not paying us 
however  we account for the possibility that certain customers may not pay us by maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain our allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
our exposure to credit losses may change as we increase our receivables 
changes in customer type and mix  as well as domestic and international economic climate  will also 
table of contents impact potential credit losses 
despite the significant amount of analysis used to compute the required allowance  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of our ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  our increase in sales may result in a higher accounts receivable balance  which may require a higher balance in the allowance 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
cash  cash equivalents  and investments we consider all highly liquid investments with maturity from date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
we maintain deposits with six financial institutions and invest our excess cash primarily in money market funds  corporate bonds  commercial paper  us government bonds  us treasury bills  and time deposits which bear minimal risk 
our cash and cash equivalents in our operating and investment accounts are with third party financial institutions 
at times  these balances exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating and investment accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
in we have experienced no lack of access to cash in our operating and investment accounts 
at december  and  we had short and long term investments of million and million  respectively recorded at fair value 
our investments consist of corporate bonds  commercial paper  us government bonds  us treasury bills  and time deposits 
we will sell certain or all investments as needed to meet the cash flow needs of our business 
hence our investments are classified as available for sale securities in accordance with asc investments debt and equity securities 
investments are classified as short term or long term based on the underlying investments maturity date 
in addition we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
see note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of our product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we record a liability for the estimated future costs associated with warranty claims  which is based upon historical experiences and our estimate of the level of future costs 
warranty costs are reflected in the statement of operations as a cost of goods sold 
we expect that warranty expense will increase as and if we increase our net sales 
warranty reserve rates may change if we change the manufacturing process or change our third party manufacturing contractors 
should actual costs differ from historical experience  increases in warranty expense may be required 
warranty reserves as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc intangibles goodwill and other asc 
our long lived assets  excluding goodwill  consist primarily of our property and equipment  the patents acquired in connection with our purchase of the intellectual property assets of ovion inc in  intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of sas in  and intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of certain assets of sigma medical in we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances may include a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows  among others 
intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
other intangible assets include patents  customer relationships  re acquired rights  license agreements and non compete agreements 
the patents include the patents acquired in connection with our purchase of the 
table of contents intellectual property assets of ovion inc they are amortized using the straight line method over their respective estimated useful lives 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
our net long lived assets as of december  and included property and equipment of million  and million  respectively  and other identifiable intangible assets of million  and million  respectively 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
we have recorded goodwill in connection with our acquisition of sas in and our acquisition of certain assets of sigma medical in under asc  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but are assigned to reporting units and tested for impairment annually  or whenever there is an impairment indicator 
asc was amended by introducing a qualitative assessment that may be used prior to performing step one of the two step quantitative goodwill impairment tests 
this amendment is captured in accounting standards update asu intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
we will adopt the standard on january  the first step of the two step quantitative impairment test for goodwill compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value  the second step determines the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill with the book value of that goodwill 
there were no goodwill impairments recorded during  or management must exercise judgment in the determination of the methods and assumptions used to perform the goodwill impairment test 
while management believes that the methods and assumptions used are reasonable  any changes in these methods or assumptions could result in a different conclusion regarding the existence of an impairment 
contingent liabilities we account for contingencies in accordance with asc contingencies asc 
asc requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency shall be accrued when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate 
nevertheless  the actual loss from a loss contingency might differ from our estimates

net sales net sales were million for as compared to million for  representing a decrease of approximately million or 
domestic sales comprised of our total sales in and of our total sales in revenue from domestic sales decreased in as compared to this decrease is primarily the result of continued macroeconomic pressures that have contributed to patients delaying non urgent procedures such as essure in the united states 
this decrease is also attributable to our decision not to implement year end incentives to our customers and raise prices as compared to in the first half of we conducted a consumer awareness campaign  including television advertising  which led to increased domestic sales throughout in we conducted a consumer awareness campaign  primarily print and digital media that commenced in september thereby the revenue contributed by this campaign in was likely less than  as the campaign was shorter in duration as compared to international sales comprised of our total sales in and of our total sales in revenue from international sales decreased in as compared to the change in international sales levels for the periods presented were primarily due to higher average selling price due to channel mix of more sales to direct countries and less sales to distributor countries  offset by lower unit volume  in particular lower sales to our distributor in spain and no sales to brazil due to lack of third party reimbursement

gross margin in was which represents a slight increase from gross margin in the gross margin increase was primarily due to manufacturing cost improvements as well as an increase in average selling price from channel mix 
our gross profit margin will vary as our sales mix changes 
increases in sales of our devices through distributors in international markets will tend to decrease our overall gross profit margin 
research and development research and development expenses were million in as compared to million in  which represents an increase of approximately million or

provision benefit for income taxes for the year ended and  we recorded approximately million and million  of income tax benefit  respectively 
our benefit for income taxes for was primarily due to our current year book loss reduced by other factors  including state taxes  foreign taxes  and non deductible stock based compensation expense 
our benefit for income taxes for was primarily due to the release of valuation allowance and recognition of deferred tax assets associated with our us operations 
as of december   we had a total valuation allowance of million against certain state and foreign deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance against the state deferred tax assets is attributable to a portion of california net operating losses that are projected to expire prior to utilization 
if the remaining valuation allowance is released in a future period  it will impact our results of operations in the periods such a determination is made 
primarily as a result of the recognition of our us deferred tax assets  we record income tax expense at the effective federal and state blended tax rates 
in the united states  there was a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets for we released the valuation allowance on our us federal and certain state deferred tax assets on december  we evaluate the likelihood of the realization of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis  and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not likely be realized

net sales net sales were million for as compared to million for  representing an increase of approximately million or 
the increase in net sales is the result of continued commercialization and marketing of the essure procedure worldwide and reflects the increasing numbers of physicians entering and completing training in the use of the procedure 
this increase was negatively impacted by continuing macroeconomic pressures that have contributed to reductions in patient visits to ob gyn physician offices  as well as ongoing competitive product trialing

gross margin in was which represents a slight decrease from gross margin in the decrease in gross margin was due to a change in channel mix characterized by greater international sales with lower average selling prices 
the decrease in gross margin was further impacted due to the acquisition of intellectual property assets  including patents and licenses  of ovion 
in connection with the purchase  ams and ovion released us from any and all current and future domestic and international royalty obligations under such licenses 
as a result  we released approximately million of accrued international royalty obligations that resulted in our gross margins increasing by approximately basis points in the third quarter of research and development research and development expenses were million in as compared to million in  which represents a decrease of approximately million or

any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our sales and marketing and research and development activities 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including  among others resources devoted to establish sales  research and development  marketing and distribution capabilities  the rate of product adoption by doctors and patients  our ability to defend our existing physician accounts against competitive trialing and potential reduced market share of the hysteroscopic sterilization market  our ability to acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses  the market price of our common stock as it affects the exercise of stock options and our convertible debt  the insurance payer community s acceptance of and reimbursement for the essure procedure  and the effect on our business due to competition

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
the values of our investments are subject to market price volatility 
our primary objective for holding investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk 
as of december  we had short and long term available for sale investments of million recorded at fair value 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio  specifically investments in corporate bonds and us government bonds 
we had no outstanding hedging instruments for our investments as of december  we monitor our interest rate and credit risks  including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers 
we monitor our investment portfolio to ensure it is compliant with our internal investments policy 
we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 
there were no impairment charges on our investments for the year ended december  as of december   a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on the fair value of our available for sale investments 
see note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange risk a portion of our net sales are denominated in the euro and the british pound 
to date  the foreign currency exchange risk related to british pounds has been minimal due to the relative size of cml 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the translation of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars will lead to translation gains or losses which are recorded net as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk through operational means  including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency expenses  and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities 
periodically  during we entered into forward contracts to buy u 
s dollars at fixed intervals in the retail market in an over the counter environment 
as of december   we had foreign currency forward contracts to sell million euros in exchange for million maturing in january and february as of december  these forward contracts were recorded at their fair value of million in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
we had outstanding short term intercompany receivables of million as of december  we expect the changes in the fair value of the intercompany receivables to be materially offset by the changes in the fair value of the forward contracts 
as of december   a potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent strengthening in the value of the us dollar euro would be approximately million 
the purpose of these forward contracts is to minimize the risk associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we have developed a foreign exchange policy to govern our forward contracts 
these foreign currency forward contracts do not qualify as cash flow hedges and all changes in fair value are reported in earnings as part of other income and expenses 
we have not entered into any other types of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purpose 
our foreign currency forward contract valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data and do not involve management judgment
