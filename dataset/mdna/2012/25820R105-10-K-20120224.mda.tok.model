oil and natural gas reserves the following table reflects the partnership s proved developed and total proved reserves at december  the reserves are based on the reports of two independent petroleum engineering consulting firms calhoun  blair associates and laroche petroleum consultants  ltd 
as described above  the partnership does not have information that would be available to a company with oil and natural gas operations because detailed information is not generally available to owners of royalty interests 
the partnership s vice president of operations vp gathers production information and provides such information to our two independent engineering consulting firms who extrapolate from such information estimates of the reserves attributable to the royalty properties and npis based on their expertise in the oil and natural gas fields where the royalty properties and npis are situated  as well as publicly available information

item legal proceedings in january  some individuals and an association called rural residents for natural gas rights sued dorchester hugoton  ltd  along with several other operators in texas county  oklahoma regarding the use of natural gas from the wells in residences 
the operating partnership now owns and operates the properties formerly owned by dorchester hugoton 
these properties contribute a significant portion of the npi amounts paid to us 
on april   plaintiffs  for immaterial costs  dismissed with prejudice all claims against the operating partnership regarding such residential gas use 
on october   the plaintiffs filed severed claims against the operating partnership regarding royalty underpayments  which the texas county district court subsequently dismissed with a grant of time to replead 
on january   one of the original plaintiffs again sued the operating partnership for underpayment of royalty  seeking class action certification 
on october   the texas county district court granted the operating partnership s motion for summary judgment finding no royalty underpayments 
subsequently  the district court denied the plaintiff s motion for reconsideration  and the plaintiff filed an appeal 
on march   the appeal decision reversed and remanded to the texas county district court to resolve material issues of fact 
on june   the district court issued a revised partial summary judgment in favor of the operating partnership

cash distributions by year exclude the fourth quarter distribution declared in january of the following year  but include the prior year fourth quarter distribution declared in january of the current year 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our results during were strong despite declining natural gas prices and reduced drilling activity in many of our producing areas 
significant results include the following net income of million  distributions of million to our limited partners  identification of new wells located on our royalty and net profits interest properties in states  consummation of leases of our mineral interest in undeveloped properties located in counties and parishes in seven states  and minerals npi reaches payout resulting in an increase in oil reserves of mbbls and gas reserves of  mmcf 
critical accounting policies we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all such costs are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test  however  which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and natural gas reserves discounted at plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
our partnership did not assign any book or market value to unproved properties  including nonproducing royalty  mineral and leasehold interests 
the full cost ceiling is evaluated at the end of each quarter and when events indicate possible impairment 
no impairments have been recorded since the discounted present value of our proved oil and natural gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and requires many subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering and geological analyses 
different reserve engineers could reach different conclusions as to estimated quantities of natural gas or crude oil reserves based on the same information 
our reserve estimates are prepared by independent consultants 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding reserve estimates  and revisions are made to prior estimates based on updated information 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
significant downward revisions could result in an impairment representing a non cash charge to income 
in addition to the impact on calculation of the ceiling test  estimates of proved reserves are also a major component of the calculation of depletion 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of our reserves are objectively determined 
the ceiling test calculation requires use of the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price during the month period ending on the balance sheet date and costs in effect as of the last day of the accounting period  which are generally held constant for the life of the properties 
as a result  the present value is not necessarily an indication of the fair value of the reserves 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile  and the prevailing prices at any given time may not reflect our partnership s or the industry s forecast of future prices 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
for example  estimates of uncollected revenues and unpaid expenses from royalty properties and npis operated by non affiliated entities are particularly subjective due to the inability to gain accurate and timely information 
therefore  actual results could differ from those estimates 
please see item business customers and pricing and item properties royalty properties for additional discussion 
contractual obligations our office lease in dallas  texas comprises our contractual obligations 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations results of operations normally  our period to period changes in net income and cash flows from operating activities are principally determined by changes in oil and natural gas sales volumes and prices  and to a lesser extent  by capital expenditures deducted under the npi calculation 
our portion of oil and natural gas sales volumes and weighted average sales prices are shown in the following table

comparison of the twelve month periods ended december   and royalty properties oil sales volumes increased from mbbls during to mbbls during  and then increased to mbbls during the increases were partially due to the acquisition of maecenas minerals llp on march  as well as activity in the bakken shale trend of north dakota 
royalty properties gas sales volumes increased from  mmcf during to  mmcf during  and then increased to  mmcf during the increases in natural gas volumes in and were primarily due to the acquisition of maecenas minerals llp effective march   the acquisition of barnett shale properties effective june   and their subsequent development 
beginning in the third quarter of oil and gas sales volumes attributable to our npis included volumes attributable to the minerals npi 
the minerals npi had cumulative revenues in excess of cumulative operating and development costs during the period ending september  sales volumes and prices attributable to the minerals npi during periods prior to the third quarter of are excluded from the above table because dmlp did not receive any payments from such npi sales volumes during those prior periods

additionally  natural gas prices include a natural gas liquids payment accrual of mcf related to production compared to mcf in the accrued natural gas liquids payment of mcf is included in the mcf average gas sales price for the natural gas liquids payments are based on an oklahoma guymon hugoton field gas delivery agreement that is in effect through under the terms of the agreement  when the market price of natural gas liquids increases sufficiently disproportionately to natural gas market prices  the operating partnership receives a portion of that increase in an annual payment 
in the event the evaluation at the end of the annual contract period shows the payment to be determinable and collectable  the revenue is accrued 
generally  we receive payment in the first quarter of the following year 
our operating revenues increased from  during to  in and subsequently increased to  in increased oil and natural gas volumes from property acquisitions effective march   the minerals npi reaching payout in  increased natural gas liquids payments and increased oil prices offset the lower natural gas prices

climate change climate change has become the subject of an important public policy debate 
in response to climate change concerns  many foreign countries are adopting climate change legislation and regulations 
although the united states congress has considered adopting climate change legislation  it has yet to enact such legislation and or regulations at the federal level 
several states have adopted or are considering adopting climate change legislation 
further  the environmental protection agency epa issued greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect january  those regulations require that regulated facilities report by march  and annually thereafter 
the epa has issued final regulations requiring petroleum and natural gas operators meeting a certain emission threshold to report their greenhouse gas emissions to the epa 
in addition to the measuring and reporting requirements  the epa issued an endangerment finding under section a of the clean air act  concluding greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of future generations and has indicated that it will use data collected through the reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future greenhouse gas emission limits 
the current state of development of many state and federal climate change regulatory initiatives makes it difficult to predict with certainty the future impact on us  including accurately estimating the related compliance costs that the operating partnership and oil and natural gas operators that develop our properties may incur 
see item a 
risk factors environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could affect our cash flow and the adoption of climate change legislation by congress could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas production from our properties 
texas margin tax texas imposes a franchise tax commonly referred to as the texas margin tax at a rate of on gross revenues less certain deductions  as specifically set forth in the texas margin tax statute 
the texas margin tax applies to corporations and limited liability companies  general and limited partnerships unless otherwise exempt  limited liability partnerships  trusts unless otherwise exempt  business trusts  business associations  professional associations  joint stock companies  holding companies  joint ventures and certain other business entities having limited liability protection 
limited partnerships that receive at least of their gross income from designated passive sources  including royalties from mineral properties and other non operated mineral interest income  and do not receive more than of their income from operating an active trade or business  are generally exempt from the texas margin tax as passive entities 
we believe our partnership meets the requirements for being considered a passive entity for texas margin tax purposes and  therefore  it is exempt from the texas margin tax 
if the partnership is exempt from texas margin tax as a passive entity  each unitholder that is considered a taxable entity under the texas margin tax would generally be required to include its portion of partnership revenues in its own texas margin tax computation 
the texas administrative code provides such income is sourced according to the principal place of business of the partnership  which would be the state of texas 
each unitholder is urged to consult an independent tax advisor regarding the requirements for filing state income  franchise and texas margin tax returns 
liquidity and capital resources capital resources our primary sources of capital are our cash flow from the royalty properties and the npis 
we are not directly liable for the payment of any exploration  development or production costs 
we do not have any transactions  arrangements or other relationships that could materially affect our liquidity or the sustainability of capital resources 
pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement  we cannot incur indebtedness  other than trade payables  i in excess of  in the aggregate at any given time or ii which would constitute acquisition indebtedness as defined in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
our only cash requirements are the distributions of all our net cash flow to our unitholders  the payment of oil and natural gas production and property taxes not otherwise deducted from gross production revenues and general and administrative expenses incurred on our behalf and allocated in accordance with our partnership agreement 
since the distributions to our unitholders are  by definition  determined after the payment of all expenses actually paid by us  the only cash requirements that may create liquidity concerns for us are the payments of expenses 
since many of these expenses vary directly with oil and natural gas prices and sales volumes  such as production taxes  we anticipate that sufficient funds will be available at all times for payment of these expenses 
of the expenses that do not vary with oil and natural gas prices and sales volumes  most are reimbursements to our general partner for allocable general and administrative costs including home office rent  salaries  and employee benefit plans 
such reimbursements are generally limited to of an amount primarily based on annual distributions to our limited partners 
historically  all such reimbursements have been substantially below the limit established by the partnership agreement 
consequently  even during the economic downturn  our business risks were essentially limited to distribution amount decreases

risk factors risks related to our business cash distributions are affected by production and other costs  some of which are outside of our control

expenses and capital expenditures the operating partnership plans to continue its efforts to increase production in oklahoma by techniques that may include fracture treating  deepening  recompleting  and drilling 
costs vary widely and are not predictable as each effort requires specific engineering 
such activities by the operating partnership could influence the amount we receive from the npis as reflected in the accrual basis production costs mcfe in the table under results of operations 
the operating partnership owns and operates the wells  pipelines and natural gas compression and dehydration facilities on its properties located in kansas and oklahoma 
the operating partnership anticipates gradual increases in expenses as repairs to these facilities become more frequent and anticipates gradual increases in field operating expenses as reservoir pressure declines 
the operating partnership does not anticipate incurring significant expense to replace these facilities at this time 
these capital and operating costs are reflected in the npi payments we receive from the operating partnership 
in  oklahoma regulations removed production quantity restrictions in the guymon hugoton field and did not address efforts by third parties to persuade oklahoma to permit infill drilling in the guymon hugoton field 
infill drilling could require considerable capital expenditures 
the outcome and the cost of such activities are unpredictable and could influence the amount we receive from the npis 
the operating partnership believes it now has sufficient field compression and permits for vacuum operation for the foreseeable future 
liquidity and working capital year end cash and cash equivalents totaled  for   for  and  for distributions distributions to limited partners and the general partner related to cash receipts for the period from october through december were as follows in thousands year quarter record date payment date per unit amount limited partners general partner th january  february  st april  may  nd july  august  rd october  november  total distributions paid in th january  february  in general  the limited partners are allocated of the royalty properties net receipts and of our npi net receipts 
net profits interests we receive monthly payments from the operating partnership equal to of the net proceeds actually realized by the operating partnership from the properties underlying the net profits interests or npis 
the operating partnership retains the balance of these net proceeds 
net proceeds generally reflect gross proceeds attributable to oil and natural gas production actually received during the month less production costs actually paid during the same month 
production costs generally reflect drilling  completion  operating and general and administrative costs and exclude depletion  amortization and other non cash costs 
the operating partnership made npi payments to us totaling  during october through september  which payments reflected of total net proceeds of  realized from september through august net proceeds realized by the operating partnership during september through november were reflected in npi payments made during october through december these payments were included in the fourth quarter distribution paid in early and are excluded from this analysis 
royalty properties revenues from the royalty properties are typically paid to us with proportionate severance production taxes deducted and remitted by others 
additionally  we generally pay ad valorem taxes  general and administrative costs  and marketing and associated costs since royalties and lease bonuses generally do not otherwise bear operating or similar costs 
after deduction of the above described costs including cash reserves  our net cash receipts from the royalty properties during the period october through september were  of which  was distributed to the limited partners and  was distributed to the general partner 
proceeds received by us from the royalty properties during the period october through december became part of the fourth quarter distribution paid in early  which is excluded from this analysis 
distribution determinations the actual calculation of distributions is performed each calendar quarter in accordance with our partnership agreement 
the following calculation covering the period october through september demonstrates the method 
in thousands limited partners general partner of net cash receipts from royalty properties of net cash receipts from royalty properties of npi payments to our partnership of npi payments to our partnership total distributions operating partnership share of net proceeds total general partner share of total in summary  our limited partners received  and our general partner received of the net cash generated by our activities and those of the operating partnership during this period 
due to these fixed percentages  our general partner does not have any incentive distribution rights or other right or arrangement that will increase its percentage share of net cash generated by our activities or those of the operating partnership 
during the period october through september  our partnership s quarterly distribution payments to limited partners were based on all of its available cash 
our partnership s only significant cash reserves that influenced quarterly payments were  for ad valorem taxes 
additionally  certain production costs under the npi calculation and a small portion of management expense reimbursements include amounts for which funds were set aside monthly to enable payment when due 
examples are contributions to sep ira accounts and payroll taxes 
these amounts generally are not held for periods over one year 
fourth quarter distribution indicated price in an effort to provide information concerning prices of oil and natural gas sales that correspond to our quarterly distributions  management calculates the weighted average price by dividing gross revenues received by the net volumes of the corresponding product without regard to the timing of the production to which such sales may be attributable 
this indicated price does not necessarily reflect the contractual terms for such sales and may be affected by transportation costs  location differentials  and quality and gravity adjustments 
while the relationship between the partnership s cash receipts and the timing of the production of oil and natural gas may be described generally  actual cash receipts may be materially impacted by purchasers release of suspended funds and by prior period adjustments 
cash receipts attributable to the partnership s royalty properties during the fourth quarter totaled approximately million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following information provides quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposures to market risk 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices  interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of possible losses 
market risk related to oil and natural gas prices essentially all of our assets and sources of income are from the royalty properties and the npis  which generally entitle us to receive a share of the proceeds from oil and natural gas production on those properties 
consequently  we are subject to market risk from fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years 
we do not anticipate entering into financial hedging activities intended to reduce our exposure to oil and natural gas price fluctuations 
absence of interest rate and currency exchange rate risk we do not anticipate having a credit facility or incurring any debt  other than trade debt 
therefore  we do not expect interest rate risk to be material to us 
we do not anticipate engaging in transactions in foreign currencies which could expose us to foreign currency related market risk
