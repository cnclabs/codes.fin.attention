in july  the company also completed its purchase of the remaining ownership interest in its mexican equity affiliate  tecniquimia mexicana  sa de sa  for approximately million 
with the acquisitions  the company becomes a leading player in die casting distribution and  also  strengthens its presence in the growing mexican market 
during  the company s results reflect some unusual items 
the purchase of the remaining ownership interest in the company s mexican affiliate resulted in a one time  non cash gain of approximately million  or approximately per diluted share  related to the revaluation of the company s previously held ownership interest to its fair value 
the company recorded an approximate million  or per diluted share gain  related to a fair value adjustment to a contingent consideration liability 
also in  the company completed an equity offering of approximately million shares  raising approximately million of net cash proceeds  which caused an approximate dilutive effect on the earnings per diluted share

the full year was a record in terms of sales and earnings for the company in a very challenging global environment 
the company overcame record levels of raw material increases and increased its volumes and market share  even excluding acquisitions 
its recent acquisitions have positioned the company well for further product line and geographic expansion  and the equity offering completed in early further strengthened its balance sheet and provides the company with the financial flexibility to take advantage of additional acquisition and other growth opportunities as they arise 
as the company looks to  it sees a mix of factors which could impact its results 
the negatives include a sluggish global economy  especially in europe  a lower rate of growth in china  escalating sg a costs in emerging markets  and a stronger us dollar 
offsetting these negatives are the continued recovery of manufacturing in north america  the full year impact of acquisitions  as well as growth due to the company s investment in strategic initiatives 
for  the company expects another strong year with net income expected to surpass the net income of million  which excludes the non cash gain related to its mexican acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates quaker s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon quaker s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires quaker to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  quaker evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer sales incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  property  plant and equipment  investments  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  incentive compensation plans including equity based compensation  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
quaker bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents quaker believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and inventory reserves and exposures quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
further  a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel and automotive industries  where a number of bankruptcies have occurred during recent years and companies have experienced financial difficulties 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
these matters may increase the company s exposure  should a bankruptcy occur  and may require a write down or a disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
reserves for customers filing for bankruptcy protection are generally dependent on the company s evaluation of likely proceeds from the bankruptcy process 
large and or financially distressed customers are generally reserved for on a specific review basis  while a general reserve is maintained for other customers based on historical experience 
the company s consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
further  the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
an increase of to the recorded provisions would have decreased the company s pre tax earnings by approximately million in  and  respectively 
environmental and litigation reserves accruals for environmental and litigation matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accrued liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not discounted 
environmental costs and remediation costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property from the date acquired or constructed  and or mitigate or prevent contamination in the future 
estimates for accruals for environmental matters are based on a variety of potential technical solutions  governmental regulations and other factors  and are subject to a large range of potential costs for remediation and other actions 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in determining the most likely estimate within the range of total costs  and the factors determining this judgment may vary over time 
similarly  reserves for litigation and similar matters are based on a range of potential outcomes and require considerable judgment in determining the most probable outcome 
if no amount within the range is considered more probable than any other amount  the company accrues the lowest amount in that range in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
realizability of equity investments quaker holds equity investments in various foreign companies  whereby it has the ability to influence  but not control  the operations of the entity and its future results 
quaker records an impairment charge to an investment when it believes a decline in value that is other than temporary has occurred 
future adverse changes in market conditions  poor operating results of underlying investments  or devaluation of foreign currencies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments 
these indicators may result in an impairment charge in the future 
the carrying amount of the company s equity investments at december  was million and comprised three investments totaling million in nippon quaker chemical  ltd 
japan at  million in kelko quaker chemical  sa venezuela at and million in kelko quaker chemical  sa panama at  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
tax exposures  valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions quaker records expenses and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that will be ultimately determined to be deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions 
the filed tax returns are subject to audit  which often occur several years subsequent to the date of the financial statements 
disputes or disagreements may arise during audits over the timing or validity of certain items or deductions  which may not be resolved for extended periods of time 
quaker applies the provisions of fasb s guidance regarding uncertain tax positions 
the guidance applies to all income tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns or expected to be taken on a future tax return 
the guidance prescribes a benefit recognition model with a two step approach  a more likely than not recognition criterion  and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon effective settlement 
the guidance further requires that the amount of interest expense and income to be recognized related to uncertain tax positions be computed by applying the applicable statutory rate of interest to the difference between the tax position recognized in accordance with the guidance  including timing differences  and the amount previously taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
quaker also records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while quaker has considered future taxable income and employs prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event quaker were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should quaker determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
both determinations could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
us income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries since it is the company s intention to continue to reinvest these earnings in those foreign subsidiaries for working capital needs and growth initiatives 
us and foreign income taxes that would be payable if such earnings were distributed may be lower than the amount computed at the us statutory rate due to the availability of foreign tax credits 

table of contents restructuring liabilities restructuring charges may consist of charges for employee severance  rationalization of manufacturing facilities and other items 
to account for such charges  the company applies fasb s guidance regarding exit or disposal cost obligations 
this guidance requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company records goodwill and intangible assets at fair value as of the acquisition date and amortizes definite lived intangible assets on a straight line basis over the useful lives of the intangible assets based on third party valuations of the assets 
goodwill and intangible assets  which have indefinite lives  are not amortized and are required to be assessed at least annually for impairment 
the company compares the assets fair value to their carrying value  primarily based on future discounted cash flows  in order to determine if an impairment charge is warranted 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
the company completed its annual impairment assessment as of the end of the third quarter  and no impairment charge was warranted 
the company s consolidated goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
the company s assumption of weighted average cost of capital wacc and estimated future net operating profit after tax nopat are particularly important in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred 
the company currently uses a wacc of and  at september   this assumption would have had to increase by more than percentage points before any of the company s reporting units would fail step one of the impairment analysis 
further  at september   the company s estimate of future nopat would have had to decrease by more than before any of the company s reporting units would be considered potentially impaired 
as a result  the estimated fair value of each of the company s reporting units substantially exceeds their carrying value 
postretirement benefits the company provides certain pension and other postretirement benefits to employees and retirees 
independent actuaries  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  perform the required valuations to determine benefit expense and  if necessary  non cash charges to equity for additional minimum pension liabilities 
critical assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels  and expected long term rates of return on assets 
if different assumptions were used  additional pension expense or charges to equity might be required 
the company s us pension plan year end is november  and the measurement date is december the following table highlights the potential impact on the company s pre tax earnings  due to changes in assumptions with respect to the company s pension plans  based on assets and liabilities at december  percentage point increase percentage point decrease foreign domestic total foreign domestic total dollars in millions discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets recently issued accounting standards the fasb updated its guidance in december regarding disclosures pertaining to the netting and offsetting of derivatives and financial instruments on an entity s consolidated balance sheet 
disclosures required under the updated guidance include presenting gross amounts of assets and liabilities related to financial instruments that may have been historically offset on the consolidated balance sheet 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim fiscal periods beginning on or after january  the company is currently evaluating the effect of this guidance 
the fasb updated its guidance in september regarding goodwill impairment testing 
the updated guidance permits a company to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if the company determines that their reporting units fair value is more than likely above its carrying value  no further impairment testing is required 
however  if the company concludes otherwise  then the first step of the traditional two step goodwill impairment test is required to be performed 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim fiscal periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted if an entity s financial statements have not been issued as of the date of the entity s interim or annual impairment test 
the company elected to test goodwill for impairment under the traditional two step method during and is currently evaluating the guidance for future applicability 
the fasb updated its guidance in june regarding presentation of comprehensive income 
comprehensive income will be required to be presented with the consolidated statement of income or as a separate financial statement immediately following the consolidated statement of income 
presentation of comprehensive income will no longer be presented as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim fiscal periods beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the effect of this guidance 

table of contents the fasb updated its guidance in may regarding disclosures pertaining to assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
the guidance requires quantitative measures regarding unobservable inputs for level assets and liabilities to be disclosed 
additionally  the guidance requires a sensitivity analysis be performed and disclosed regarding those inputs 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim fiscal periods beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the effect of this guidance 
liquidity and capital resources quaker s cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december  from million at december  the million decrease was the net result of million of cash provided by operating activities  million of cash used in investing activities  million of cash provided by financing activities and a million decrease from the effect of exchange rates on cash 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million in  compared to million provided by operating activities in the company s increase in net income was more than offset by increased investment in working capital 
as business volumes and raw material prices continued to escalate from to  the company s need for working capital investment correspondingly increased 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million in  compared to million of cash used in lower payments for acquisitions in were the primary driver in the change in cash flows used in investing activities 
in the fourth quarter of  the company completed its acquisition of gw smith sons  inc for approximately million and  in the third quarter of  the company completed its acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in tecniquimia mexicana de cv for approximately million 
during the third quarter of  the company completed the acquisition of da stuart s da aluminum hot rolling business from houghton international for million and  in the fourth quarter of  the company acquired summit lubricants  inc for million  and finalized the purchase with a working capital adjustment of million in these decreases were partially offset by higher investments in the company s new york and china facilities  as well as the company s global erp system 
in addition  the receipt of the final payment in the first quarter of from the company s insurance settlement discussed below and decreases in the company s construction fund  related to the company s middletown  oh expansion  also affected the investing cash flow comparisons 
in the first quarter of  an inactive subsidiary of the company reached a settlement agreement and release with one of its insurance carriers for million 
the proceeds of the settlement are restricted and can only be used to pay claims and costs of defense associated with this subsidiary s asbestos litigation 
the payments were structured to be received over a four year period with annual installments of million  the final installment of which was received in the first quarter of during the third quarter of  the same inactive subsidiary and one of its insurance carriers entered into a claim handling and funding agreement  under which the carrier will pay of the defense and indemnity costs incurred by or on behalf of the subsidiary in connection with asbestos bodily injury claims for a minimum of five years beginning july  the agreement continues until terminated and can only be terminated by either party by providing the other party with a minimum of two years prior written notice 
net cash flows provided by financing activities were million in  compared with million provided by financing activities in the company s second quarter offering of approximately million shares of its common stock resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately million  which was used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings on the company s revolving credit line 
in  the company had net borrowings  which supplemented its cash flow from operations  to fund acquisition activity and working capital requirements 
during  the company recorded million of excess tax benefits related to stock options exercises in capital in excess of par on its condensed consolidated balance sheet  and as a cash flow from financing activities in its condensed consolidated statement of cash flows 
during  the company recorded approximately million of these benefits on its consolidated balance sheet  and as a cash inflow from financing activities in its consolidated statement of cash flows  related to stock option exercises which occurred over prior years 
prior to  the company s actual taxable income in affected jurisdictions was not sufficient to recognize these benefits  while the company s taxable income was sufficient to recognize the benefits 
also  higher stock option exercise activity in the prior year and higher dividend payments affected the financing cash flow comparisons 
the company s primary credit line is a million syndicated multicurrency credit agreement with bank of america  na administrative agent and certain other major financial institutions  which expires in june at the company s option  the principal amount available can be increased to million if the lenders agree to increase their commitments and the company satisfies certain conditions 
at december  and december   the company had approximately million and million outstanding  respectively 
the company s access to this credit is largely dependent on its consolidated leverage ratio covenant  which cannot exceed to at december   the consolidated leverage ratio was below to  and at december   the consolidated leverage ratio was below to under this covenant and the borrowing capacity available on the company s primary credit line  an additional million could have been borrowed as of december  the company has entered into interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of million as of december   in order to fix the interest rate on that amount of its variable rate debt 
outstanding financial derivative instruments may expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
to manage credit risk  the company limits its exposure to any single counterparty 
however  the company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 
the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission the sec in the registration statement was declared effective on january  and permits the company to offer and sell  from time to time and in one or more public offerings  up to million aggregate dollar amount of its securities  which may be shares of preferred stock either separately or represented by depositary shares  common stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase our debt or equity securities  as well as units that include any of these securities  on terms  in each case  established at the time of the offering

during  the company sold approximately million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately million utilizing this shelf registration 

table of contents at december   the company s gross liability for uncertain tax positions  including interest and penalties  was million 
the company cannot determine a reliable estimate of the timing of cash flows by period related to its uncertain tax position liability 
however  should the entire liability be paid  the amount of the payment may be reduced by up to million as a result of offsetting benefits in other tax jurisdictions 
the company believes it is capable of supporting its operating requirements  including pension plan contributions  payments of dividends to shareholders  possible acquisitions and business opportunities  capital expenditures and possible resolution of contingencies through internally generated funds supplemented with debt or equity as needed 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
pension and other postretirement plan contributions beyond are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets 
the timing of payments related to other long term liabilities  which consist primarily of deferred compensation agreements  also cannot be readily determined due to their uncertainty 
interest obligations on the company s short and long term debt are included and assume the debt levels will be outstanding for the entire respective period and apply the interest rates in effect at december  the contingent acquisition consideration is included based on management s estimate of the probability of the earnout being ultimately met paid and the discount rate in effect at the time of acquisition payments due by period and contractual obligations amounts in millions total beyond long term debt capital lease obligations non cancelable operating leases purchase obligations pension and other postretirement plan contributions contingent acquisition consideration other long term liabilities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements total contractual cash obligations operations cms discussion the company currently has numerous cms contracts around the world 
under its traditional cms approach  the company effectively acts as an agent  and the revenues and costs from these sales are reported on a net sales or pass through basis 
under certain cms contracts  the contracts are structured differently in that the company s revenue received from the customer is a fee for products and services provided to the customer  which are indirectly related to the actual costs incurred 
profit is dependent on how well the company controls product costs and achieves product conversions from other third party suppliers products to its own products 
as a result  under the alternative structure  the company recognizes in reported revenue the gross revenue received from the cms site customer and in cost of goods sold the third party product purchases  which substantially offset each other until the company achieves significant product conversions 
this may result in a decrease in reported gross margin as a percentage of sales 
the company has maintained a mix of contracts with both the traditional product pass through structure and the alternative structure including fixed price contracts that cover all services and products 
since the global economic downturn and its impact on the automotive sector  the company has experienced shifts in customer requirements and business circumstances  but the company s offerings will continue to include both approaches to cms

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quaker is exposed to the impact of interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in commodity prices  and credit risk 
interest rate risk 
quaker s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short and long term debt 
most of quaker s debt is negotiated at market rates 
accordingly  if interest rates rise significantly  the cost of debt to quaker will increase 
this can have an adverse effect on quaker  depending on the extent of quaker s borrowings 
as of december   quaker had approximately million in borrowings under its credit facility at a weighted average borrowing rate of approximately libor plus a spread 
if interest rates had changed by  the company s interest expense would have correspondingly increased or decreased approximately million 
the company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for the purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
the company has entered into interest rate swaps in order to fix a portion of its variable rate debt 
the swaps had a combined notional value of million and a fair value of million at december   and a combined notional value of million and a fair value of million at december  as of december   the company was receiving a libor rate and paying an additional average fixed rate of approximately on its interest rate swaps 
the company s swaps mature in the counterparties to the swaps are major financial institutions 
outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
to manage credit risk  the company limits its exposure to any single counterparty 
however  the company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 
see the information included under the caption derivatives in note and the information in note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report and is incorporated herein by reference 
foreign exchange risk 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues and earnings is generated by its foreign operations 
these foreign operations also represent a significant portion of quaker s assets and liabilities 
all such operations use the local currency as their functional currency 
accordingly  quaker s financial results are affected by risks typical of global business such as currency fluctuations  particularly between the us dollar  the brazilian real  the chinese renminbi and the eu euro 
as exchange rates vary  quaker s results can be materially affected 
if the brazilian real  the eu euro and the chinese renminbi had each changed by against the us dollar  the company s revenues and pre tax earnings would have correspondingly increased or decreased approximately million and million  respectively 
the company generally does not use financial instruments that expose it to significant risk involving foreign currency transactions  however  the size of non us activities has a significant impact on reported operating results and the attendant net assets 
during the past three years  sales by non us subsidiaries accounted for approximately to of consolidated net annual sales 
in addition  the company often sources inventory among its worldwide operations 
this practice can give rise to foreign exchange risk resulting from the varying cost of inventory to the receiving location  as well as from the revaluation of intercompany balances 
the company mitigates this risk through local sourcing efforts 
commodity price risk 
many of the raw materials used by quaker are commodity chemicals  and  therefore  quaker s earnings can be materially affected by market changes in raw material prices 
in certain cases  quaker has entered into fixed price purchase contracts having a term of up to two years 
these contracts provide for protection to quaker if the price for the contracted raw materials rises  however  in certain limited circumstances  quaker will not realize the benefit if such prices decline 
if the company s gross margin had changed by one percentage point  the company s pretax earnings would have correspondingly increased or decreased by approximately million 
credit risk 
quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel and automotive industries  including some of our larger customers  where a number of bankruptcies occurred during recent years and companies have experienced financial difficulty 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
in addition  as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
these practices may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require write down or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
customer returns of products or disputes may also result in similar issues related to the realizability of recorded accounts receivable or returned inventory 
the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
a change of to the recorded provisions would have increased or decreased the company s pre tax earnings by approximately million in  and  respectively
