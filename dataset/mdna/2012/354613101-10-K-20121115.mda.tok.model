these forward looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
you should carefully review the risk factors section set forth in item a of part i of this annual report on form k and in any more recent filings 
table of contents with the us securities and exchange commission the sec  each of which describe these risks  uncertainties and other important factors in more detail 
while forward looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made  you should not rely on them 
forward looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business  the economy and other future conditions 
because forward looking statements relate to the future  they are subject to inherent uncertainties  risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict

overview we are a global investment management organization and derive our operating revenues and net income from providing investment management and related services to investors in jurisdictions worldwide through products that include investment funds and institutional  high net worth and separately managed accounts collectively  our sponsored investment products or sips 
in addition to investment management  our services include fund administration  sales  distribution  shareholder services  transfer agency  trustee  custodial and other fiduciary services  as well as select private banking services 
our sponsored investment products and investment management and related services are distributed or marketed to the public globally under seven distinct brand names franklin  templeton  mutual series  bissett  fiduciary trust  darby and balanced equity management 
we offer a broad range of sips under equity  hybrid  fixed income and cash management funds and accounts  including alternative investment products  that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individual and institutional investors 
we also manage certain sub advised investment products which may be sold to the public under one of our brand names or those of other companies or on a co branded basis 
effective july   we have one operating segment  investment management and related services 
previously  we had a secondary operating segment  banking finance  which offered select retail banking  private banking and consumer lending services 
during the fiscal year ended september  fiscal year  we significantly reduced these services and now only offer select private banking services to investment management clients 
the level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management aum 
as noted in the risk factors section set forth above in item a of part i of this annual report on form k  the amount and mix of our aum are subject to significant fluctuations and can negatively impact our revenues and income 
the level of our revenues also depends on mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts 
the fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our sips or our clients 
these arrangements could change in the future 
during fiscal year  global financial markets produced strong positive returns  evidenced by a increase in the msci world index  a increase in the s p index  and a increase in the barclays global aggregate index 
the markets recovered from the significant volatility and negative sentiment experienced during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended september  fiscal year  but remained volatile throughout the year amid continued investor concerns related to the european sovereign debt crisis and the global economy 
in this environment our simple monthly average aum average aum and earnings per share increased slightly from fiscal year our total aum at september  was billion  higher than at september  the increase was almost entirely due to billion in market appreciation as the strong market returns resulted in valuation increases in all investment objectives 
the increase in average aum was lower  at  due to market volatility and depreciation experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year long term sales decreased to billion for fiscal year  primarily due to reduced demand for global international fixed income and equity products 
redemption activity decreased to billion  as global international equity and tax free fixed income product redemptions declined  but were partially offset by an increase in redemptions in global international fixed income products 

table of contents the business and regulatory environments in which we operate remain complex  uncertain and subject to change 
in the us  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the reform act imposes additional restrictions and limitations on our business  and we expect that the foreign account tax compliance act fatca will cause us to incur significant administrative and compliance costs 
we are also subject to numerous regulations by us and us regulators that add further complexity to our ongoing global compliance operations 
uncertainties regarding economic stabilization and improvement remain in the foreseeable future 
as we continue to confront the challenges of the current economic and regulatory environments  we remain focused on the investment performance of our sips and on providing high quality customer service to our clients 
while we are focused on expense management  we will also seek to attract  retain and develop employees and invest strategically in systems and technology that will provide a secure and stable environment 
we will continue to protect and further our brand recognition while developing and maintaining broker dealer and client relationships 
the success of these and other strategies may be influenced by the factors discussed in the risk factors section in part i of this annual report

investment performance overview a key driver of our overall success is the long term investment performance of our sips 
a standard measure of the performance of these investment products is the percentage of aum exceeding benchmarks and peer group medians 
the long term investment performance of our fixed income products has been strong with aum frequently outperforming the benchmarks and peer group medians for the three  five and ten year periods ended september  our global international fixed income funds generated exceptional results with at least of aum exceeding the benchmarks and peer group medians for all periods presented  as did our hybrid products with at least of aum exceeding the peer group median for all periods 
in addition  at least of aum of our tax free fixed income products exceeded the peer group medians for the five and ten year periods 
the long term performance of our equity products has also been solid with aum regularly exceeding the peer group medians for the three  five and ten year periods 

table of contents the performance of our products against benchmarks and peer group medians is presented in the table below 
benchmark comparison peer group comparison of aum exceeding benchmark of aum in top two peer group quartiles as of september  year year year year year year year year equity global international united states total equity hybrid fixed income tax free taxable global international united states total fixed income aum measured in the benchmark and peer group rankings represents of our total aum as of september  the benchmark comparisons are based on each fund s return as compared to a market index that has been selected to be generally consistent with the investment objectives of the fund 
the peer group rankings are sourced from lipper  morningstar or evestment in each fund s market and were based on an absolute ranking of returns as of september  for products with multiple share classes  rankings for the primary share class are applied to the entire product 
private equity  certain privately offered emerging market and real estate funds and cash management are not included 
certain other funds and products were also excluded because of limited benchmark or peer group data 
had this data been available  the results may have been different 
these results assume the reinvestment of dividends  are based on data available as of october  and are subject to revision 
while we remain focused on achieving strong long term performance  our future benchmark and peer group rankings may vary from our past performance

investment management fees sales and distribution fees shareholder servicing fees other  net total operating revenues investment management fees investment management fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sips and the sub advised products that we manage as a percentage of the market value of aum 
annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided 
rates for products sold outside of the us are generally higher than for us products because they are structured to compensate for certain distribution costs 

table of contents investment management fees decreased million in fiscal year the decrease in fees was primarily due to a lower effective fee rate as described below  partially offset by a increase in average aum which originated from non us products  primarily in the global international fixed income objective 
investment management fees increased million in fiscal year approximately of the increase was due to a increase in average aum  which was driven by net new flows from global international fixed income products and acquisitions  as well as higher valuation levels resulting from market appreciation across most investment objectives during the first nine months of the fiscal year 
the increase in fees was also impacted to a lesser extent by higher effective fee rates 
our effective investment management fee rate investment management fees divided by average aum was basis points for fiscal year  as compared to basis points for fiscal year and basis points for fiscal year the rate decrease in fiscal year primarily resulted from lower levels and weighting of global international equity aum  which generally carry the highest fee rates  and lower performance based fees  partially offset by an increase in the us hybrid rate due to the loss of an billion institutional advisory account that had a low fee rate 
the rate increase in fiscal year primarily resulted from higher levels and relative weighting of international aum  which were driven by growth in cross border products 
performance based investment management fees were million  million  and million for fiscal years  and us industry asset weighted average management fee rates were as follows in basis points industry average for the fiscal years ended september  equity global international united states hybrid fixed income tax free taxable global international united states cash management us industry asset weighted average management fee rates were calculated using information available from lipper inc as of september   and and include all us registered open end funds that reported expense data to lipper inc as of the funds most recent annual report date  and for which expenses were equal to or greater than zero 
as defined by lipper inc  management fees include fees from providing advisory and fund administration services 
the averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels  without exception 
variable annuity products are not included 
our actual effective investment management fee rates are generally higher than the us industry average rates as we actively manage our products and have a higher level of international aum  both of which generate higher fees 
changes to our effective investment management fee rates in the us have not varied significantly from changes in industry rates 
during fiscal years and  our us hybrid rate increased by approximately five basis points more than the industry rate due to losses of institutional advisory accounts of billion and billion that had low fee rates 
our product offerings and global operations are diverse 
as such  the impact of future changes in the market value of aum on investment management fees will be affected by the relative mix of investment objective  geographic region  distribution channel and investment vehicle of the assets 

table of contents sales and distribution fees we earn fees from the sale of certain classes of sips on which investors pay a commission at the time of purchase commissionable sales 
sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some share classes and for some sale transactions depending upon the amount invested and the type of investor 
therefore  sales fees will change with the overall level of gross sales  the size of individual transactions  and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors 
globally  our mutual funds and certain other products generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales  marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf 
specifically  the majority of us registered mutual funds  with the exception of certain of our money market mutual funds  have adopted distribution plans under rule b the rule b plans promulgated under the investment company act of the rule b plans permit the mutual funds to bear certain expenses relating to the distribution of their shares  such as expenses for marketing  advertising  printing and sales promotion  subject to the rule b plans limitations on amounts 
the individual rule b plans set a percentage limit for rule b expenses based on average daily net aum of the mutual fund 
similar arrangements exist for the distribution of our non us funds where  generally  the distributor of the funds in the local market arranges for and pays commissions 
we pay substantially all of our sales and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our sips to the public on our behalf

sales fees as a percentage of commissionable sales were  and for fiscal years  and commissionable sales represented  and of total sales for fiscal years  and contingent sales charges are earned from investor redemptions within a certain contracted period of time 
these charges are levied only on certain shares sold without a front end sales charge  and vary with the mix of redemptions of these shares 
shareholder servicing fees we receive shareholder servicing fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services  which include providing customer statements  transaction processing  customer service  and tax reporting 
these fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered 
in some 
table of contents instances  we charge sips these fees based on the level of aum 
in the us  transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year generally remain billable at a reduced rate through the second quarter of the following calendar year 
in canada  such agreements provide that accounts closed in the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year 
accordingly  the level of fees will vary with the change in open accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable 
approximately million accounts closed in the us during calendar year were no longer billable effective july   as compared to approximately million accounts closed during calendar year that were no longer billable effective july  approximately million accounts closed in canada during calendar year were no longer billable effective may   compared to approximately million accounts closed during calendar year that were no longer billable effective may  other services include tax planning and return preparation for individual and trust clients  for which fees are primarily account based  and trustee services  for which fees are based on the level of aum 
shareholder servicing fees increased million in fiscal year primarily due to a million increase in other service fees  mainly resulting from higher tax planning and return preparation fee rates and levels of trust aum 
transfer agency service fees decreased million primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts from the stronger us dollar in all regions and an decrease in billable shareholder accounts in canada  partially offset by increases in europe from a change in fee structures that became effective on january  and a increase in billable shareholder accounts

cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on hand  deposits with financial institutions  money market funds  securities of us government sponsored enterprises and the us treasury  and time deposits 
liquid investments consist of trading and available for sale securities  investments in equity method investees consisting of mutual fund sips  direct investments in redeemable consolidated sips  and time deposits with maturities greater than three months 
cash and cash equivalents at september  increased primarily due to net cash provided by operating and investing activities  partially offset by net cash used in financing activities 
the percentages of cash and cash equivalents held by our us and us operations were and at september   and and at september  we utilize a significant portion of our liquid assets to fund operational and regulatory requirements and capital contributions relating to our sips 
certain of our subsidiaries are required by our internal policy or regulation to maintain minimum levels of capital which are partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalents 
as a result  such subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parent companies 
also  as a multi national corporation  we operate in various locations outside of the us certain of our non us subsidiaries are subject to regulatory or contractual repatriation restrictions or requirements 
such restrictions and requirements limit our ability to transfer cash between various international jurisdictions  including repatriation to the us should we require more capital in the us than is generated domestically  we could elect to reduce the level of discretionary activities  such as share repurchases  or we could elect to repatriate future earnings from non us jurisdictions or raise capital through debt or equity issuance 
certain of these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates  increased interest expense or other dilution to our earnings 
at september  our us and us subsidiaries held approximately  million and  million of our liquid assets to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and capital contributions to our sips  as compared to approximately  million and  million held at september  capital resources we believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets  continuing cash flows from operations  the ability to issue debt or equity securities and borrowing capacity under current credit facilities 
in september  we issued senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes with a total face value of million 
the notes consist of million issued at a fixed interest rate of per annum which mature in september and million issued at a fixed rate of per annum which mature in september net proceeds 
table of contents from the issuance of the notes were used in october to redeem our senior notes due in may at a make whole redemption price of million  and in november to finance the acquisition of a majority interest in k advisors holdings llc for million in cash  the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes 
in may  we issued senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes with a total face value of million 
of the notes  million was issued at a fixed interest rate of per annum and matures in  million was issued at a fixed interest rate of per annum and matures in  and million was issued at a fixed interest rate of per annum and matures in net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used for general corporate purposes 
interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually 
the notes contain an optional redemption feature that allows us to redeem each series of notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time  at a make whole redemption price 
the indentures governing the notes contain limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pledge voting stock or profit participating equity interests in our subsidiaries to secure other debt without similarly securing the notes equally and ratably 
the indentures also include requirements that must be met if we consolidate or merge with  or sell all of our assets to  another entity 
as of september   we were in compliance with the covenants of the notes 
in prior years  we secured advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb to fund our banking services 
at september   we had million of fhlb advances outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
fhlb advances are subject to collateralization requirements 
at september   we had million of short term commercial paper available for issuance under an uncommitted private placement program which has been inactive since april  million available in uncommitted short term bank lines of credit under the federal reserve system  million available through the secured federal reserve bank short term discount window  million available in uncommitted short term bank lines of credit and million available in secured fhlb short term borrowing capacity 
our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors  including our credit rating  the condition of the global economy  investors willingness to purchase our securities  interest rates  credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets 
if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner  our business could be adversely impacted 
uses of capital we expect that our main uses of cash will be to invest in and grow our business  acquire shares of our common stock  fund property and equipment purchases  invest in our sips  pay operating expenses of the business  enhance technology infrastructure and business processes  pay stockholder dividends and repay and service debt 
we declare and pay dividends on a quarterly basis 
we declared regular cash dividends of per share per share per quarter and a special cash dividend of per share in fiscal year  and regular cash dividends of per share per share per quarter in fiscal year we currently expect to continue paying comparable regular cash dividends on a quarterly basis to holders of our common stock depending upon earnings and other relevant factors 
we maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value 
our stock repurchase program is effected through regular open market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 
during fiscal years and  we repurchased million and million shares of our common stock at a cost of million and million 
at september   approximately million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program  which is not subject to an expiration date 
during fiscal years and  we invested million and million  net of redemptions  in our sips 

table of contents in july  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of balanced equity management pty 
limited  a specialty australian equity manager  for million in cash and  shares of franklin common stock with an aggregate value of million at the acquisition date  for a total purchase consideration of million 
in january  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of rensburg fund management limited  a specialty uk equity manager  for million in cash 
in december  we purchased an office building to be used in business operations in fort lauderdale  florida for million in cash 
the funds that we manage have their own resources available for purposes of providing liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions  including securities that can be sold or provided to investors as in kind redemptions  and lines of credit 
while we have no contractual obligation to do so  we may voluntarily elect to provide the funds with direct or indirect financial support based on our business objectives 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commitments 
we believe that we can meet these obligations and commitments through existing liquid assets  continuing cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under current credit facilities 
in millions payments due by period as of september  total less than year years years more than years time deposits debt debt of consolidated sips debt of consolidated vies operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations committed capital contributions total contractual obligations and commitments time deposits and debt amounts include scheduled principal and interest payments 
purchase obligations include contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and may be canceled at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may include termination fees 
committed capital contributions primarily relate to discretionary commitments to invest in planned sip launches 
the debt holders of consolidated vies and consolidated sips have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investments  therefore we bear no risks associated with these entities liabilities 
see note variable interest entities and consolidated sponsored investment products  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
at september   our consolidated balance sheet includes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of million and related accrued interest of million see note taxes on income in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest that are expected to be paid in the next twelve months are de minimus 
however  because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  a reasonable estimate of the period of cash payments beyond the next twelve months from the balance sheet date of september  cannot be made 
consequently  unrecognized tax benefits have not been included in the table above 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in our role as agent or trustee  we facilitate the settlement of investor share purchase  redemption  and other transactions with affiliated mutual funds 
we are appointed by the affiliated mutual funds as agent or trustee to manage  on their behalf  bank deposit accounts that contain only i cash remitted by investors to the affiliated mutual funds for the direct purchase of fund shares  or ii cash remitted by the affiliated mutual funds for direct delivery to the investors for either the proceeds of fund shares liquidated at the investors direction  or dividends and capital gains earned on fund shares 
as of september  and  we held cash of approximately million and million off balance sheet in agency or trust for investors and the affiliated mutual funds 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
these estimates  judgments  and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies 
described below are the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding our results of operations and financial position 
for additional information about our accounting policies  see note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
consolidation we consolidate our subsidiaries and sips in which we have a controlling financial interest 
we are generally considered to have a controlling financial interest when we own a majority of the voting interest in an entity 
we also consolidate vies for which we are considered the primary beneficiary and non vie limited partnerships and similar structures for which we are deemed to have control 
a vie is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment 
the assessment of whether an entity is a vie or voting interest entity voe involves judgment and analysis on a structure by structure basis 
when performing the assessment we consider factors such as the entity s legal organization and our contractual involvement with and ownership interest in the entity 
a limited partnership or similar structure entity for which we are the general partner or managing member  our aggregate investment is not substantive and the limited partners or other investors do not have the substantive ability to remove us as the general partner or managing member  liquidate the entity or otherwise participate in the decision making of the entity is a vie 
otherwise the entity is a voe and we are presumed to control the entity unless the limited partners or other investors have the substantive ability to remove us as the general partner or managing member  liquidate the entity or otherwise participate in the decision making of the entity 
we use two models for determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of vies 
for all investment entities with the exception of clos  we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if we have the majority of the risks or rewards of ownership 
for all other vies  including clos  we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the variable interests that we have in investment entity vies consist of our equity ownership interest in and or investment management and related service fees earned from these vies 
we use expected cash flow scenarios to determine if our investment management and related service fees and or equity ownership interests provide us with a majority of the vie s expected losses or residual returns 
based on our evaluation  we determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these vies 
we provide collateral management services to our sponsored clos  which are asset backed financing entities collateralized by a pool of corporate debt securities  and are considered vies 
we generally earn senior and subordinated management fees from the clos based on the par value of outstanding debt securities and  in certain instances  may also receive performance based fees 
in addition  we hold equity interests in certain of these entities 
we determined 
table of contents that we are the primary beneficiary of the clos as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the clos economic performance in our role as collateral manager and hold a variable interest for which we have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the clos 
our evaluation of whether we are the primary beneficiary of vies is highly complex and involves significant judgments  estimates and assumptions 
the key estimates and assumptions used in our analyses may include the amount of aum  investment management and related service fee rates  the life of the investment product  and the discount rate 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to variability 
for example  aum is impacted by market volatility and the level of sales  redemptions  contributions  withdrawals and dividend reinvestments of mutual fund shares that occur daily 
in addition  third party purchases and redemptions  which are outside of our control  can impact our evaluation 
collateralized assets of clos are impacted by market volatility and prepayment rates 
there is judgment involved in assessing whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact vies economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from vies that could potentially be significant to the vies 
while we believe that our evaluation is appropriate  future changes in estimates  judgments  and assumptions may affect the determination of primary beneficiary status and the resulting consolidation of vies in our consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements we use a three level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable 
the three levels of fair value hierarchy are set forth below 
our assessment of the hierarchy level of the assets or liabilities measured at fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
transfers between levels are recognized at the end of each quarter 
level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level quoted prices  such as non binding quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or corroborated by observable market data 
level quoted prices are generally obtained from two independent third party brokers or dealers  including prices derived from model based valuation techniques for which the significant assumptions are observable in the market or corroborated by observable market data 
quoted prices are validated through price variance analysis  subsequent sales testing  stale price review  price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of third party vendors 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity 
these inputs require significant management judgment and reflect our estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
level valuations are derived primarily from model based valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the market 
the fair values for level assets and liabilities are determined using various methodologies in accordance with our global pricing policy which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type 
when available  we measure fair value based on the reported net asset value of underlying investments or independent third party broker or dealer price quotes 
these inputs are evaluated for reasonableness through various procedures which include due diligence reviews of the third parties  price comparisons across pricing vendors  stale price reviews and subsequent sales testing 
if these inputs are not available  we primarily employ a market based method  using purchase multiples observed for comparable third party transactions  valuations of comparable entities  projected operating results of the investee entity or subsequent financing transactions entered into by the investee entity 
if the inputs for a market based method are not available  we utilize an income based method  which considers the net present value of anticipated future cash flows of the investment 
a discount may be applied due to the nature or duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the investment 
we review and approve the market based and income based methods on a periodic basis for changes that would impact the unobservable inputs incorporated into the valuation process 
the fair value measurements from these methods are further validated through price variance analysis  subsequent sales testing and market comparable sales 

table of contents we record the majority of our investments at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
we may also measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
these fair value measurements generally result from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or write downs of individual assets 
fair values are estimated for disclosure purposes for financial instruments that are not measured at fair value 
as of september   level assets represented of total assets measured at fair value  substantially all of which related to investments of consolidated sips in equity and secured and unsecured debt securities of entities in emerging markets which are not traded in active markets 
level liabilities  comprised of long term debt of consolidated vies  represented of total liabilities measured at fair value at september  transfers into and out of level during fiscal year were immaterial 
following are descriptions of the significant assets and liabilities measured at fair value  including the fair value methodologies used and hierarchy levels 
investment securities  trading consist of non consolidated sips 
changes in the fair value of trading securities are recognized as gains and losses in earnings 
the fair value of these securities is determined based on their published net asset values and they are classified as level investment securities  available for sale consist primarily of non consolidated sips  debt securities including securities of us states and political subdivisions  securities of the us treasury and federal agencies  corporate debt securities  mortgage backed securities  and other equity securities 
realized gains and losses are included in investment income using either the average cost method or specific identification method 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded net of tax as part of accumulated other comprehensive income until realized 
the fair value of sips is determined based on their published net asset values and they are classified as level the fair value of debt securities is determined using quoted market prices  if available  or independent third party broker or dealer price quotes  which are evaluated for reasonableness  and they are generally classified as level  except for certain us treasury securities which are classified as level the fair value of other equity securities  which consist primarily of non sponsored investment products  is generally determined based on their published net asset values  and they are classified as level investment securities  available for sale are evaluated for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis when the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value 
for equity securities  we consider many factors  including the severity and duration of the decline in the fair value below cost  our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value  and the financial condition and specific events related to the issuer 
when an impairment of an equity security is determined to be other than temporary  the impairment is recognized in earnings 
for debt securities  if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost  the entire impairment is recognized in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of its amortized cost  the impairment is separated into the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss and the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors 
the credit loss component is the difference between the security s amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows  and is recognized in earnings 
losses related to all other factors are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
while we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary impairment in our investment portfolio  different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
investments of consolidated sips consist of trading securities and other investments that are not generally traded in active markets 
changes in the fair value of the investments are recognized as gains and losses in earnings 
the fair value of the trading securities is determined using quoted market prices  or independent third party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available 
these securities are primarily classified as level or level if events occur after the close of the primary market for any security  the quoted market prices may be adjusted for the observable price movements within country specific market proxies 

table of contents the investments that are not generally traded in active markets primarily consist of equity and secured and unsecured debt securities of entities in emerging markets 
the fair value of these securities is generally determined using significant unobservable inputs and they are classified as level in these instances  we employ a market based approach  using purchase multiples observed for comparable third party transactions  projected operating results of the investment  valuations of comparable companies  and subsequent financing transactions entered into by the investee entities 
if the market based approach is not available  we utilize an income based approach  which considers the net present value of anticipated future cash flows of the investment 
a discount may also be applied due to the nature or duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the investment 
investments that are not generally traded in active markets also include fund products for which the fair value is estimated using net asset value as a practical expedient and are classified as level investments and debt of consolidated vies consist of corporate debt securities held and debt issued by clos 
we elected the fair value option for all assets and liabilities of our consolidated clos 
the fair values of the corporate debt securities and debt are primarily obtained from independent third party broker or dealer price quotes and they are classified as level the clos may also hold securities and have issued debt that are classified as level because the fair value is determined using significant unobservable inputs 
in these instances  we primarily employ the market based approach described above for level securities held by consolidated sips 
while we believe the valuation methodologies described above are appropriate  the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine fair value could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
other intangible assets consist primarily of mutual fund management contracts and customer base assets resulting from business acquisitions 
we amortize these intangible assets over their estimated useful lives  which range from three to years  using the straight line method  unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life 
indefinite lived intangible assets primarily represent contracts to manage mutual fund assets for which there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period 
we make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity  as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of the related reporting unit below its carrying value 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value is less than the fair value  no impairment exists and the second step is not performed 
if the carrying value is higher than the fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in the second step  impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of the goodwill 
we have one reporting unit  investment management and related services  consistent with our single operating segment  to which all goodwill has been assigned 
prior indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired 
impairment is indicated when the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible assets  we use valuation techniques based on an income approach under which future cash flows are discounted 
our future cash flow estimates include assumptions about revenue and aum growth rates  the pre tax profit margin  the average effective fee rate  the effective tax rate  and the discount rate  which is based on our weighted average cost of capital 
the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and the discount rate 

table of contents we performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of august  we did not recognize any impairment because our estimates of the fair values of our reporting unit and our indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values 
the fair value of the investment management and related services reporting unit and over of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by more than 
the assumptions used in our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets were developed taking into account the ongoing volatility in the capital and credit markets 
as a result  the growth rate assumptions used as of august  were lower than the historical compounded growth rates 
we estimated the discounted future cash flows using a compounded annual aum growth rate for goodwill and over of our indefinite lived intangible assets  and a discount rate of 
we subsequently monitor the market conditions and their potential impact on the assumptions used in the annual calculations of fair value to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying value  or indicate that our indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
we consider  among other things  changes in our aum and weighted average cost of capital by assessing whether these changes would impact the reasonableness of the assumptions used in our impairment tests as of august  we also monitor fluctuations of our common stock per share price to evaluate our market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole 
subsequent to august   there were no impairments to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as we determined no events occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value  or indicate that our indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
we test definite lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly 
impairment is indicated when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
in evaluating the recoverability of definite lived intangible assets  we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from these assets 
our future undiscounted cash flow projections include assumptions about revenue and aum growth rates  effective fee rates  investor redemptions  the pre tax profit margin  and expected useful lives 
the most relevant of these assumptions to determine future cash flows is the change in the amount of aum 
the assumptions used in our impairment tests are developed taking into consideration the ongoing market conditions 
if the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows  the impairment loss is measured based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the fair value of the asset is determined by discounted cash flows or other methods as appropriate for the asset type 
as of september   the undiscounted future cash flow projections for million  or  of our definite lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by at least 
we estimated the future undiscounted cash flows for these assets using aum growth rates ranging from to 
the assumptions used in the impairment tests for definite lived intangible assets were developed taking into consideration current market conditions 
as of september   a decline in aum of approximately could cause us to evaluate whether their fair value is below the carrying value 
there was no impairment of definite lived intangible assets for fiscal year while we believe that our impairment tests and the assumptions used to estimate fair value are reasonable and appropriate  if the assumptions used in our estimates of fair value change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise accelerate amortization expense 
revenues investment management  shareholder servicing and distribution fees are recognized as earned over the period in which services are rendered  except for performance based investment management fees  which are recognized when earned 
sales commissions related to the sale of shares of sips are recognized on trade date 
investment management fees are generally determined based on a percentage of aum  except for performance based investment management fees  which are based on performance targets established in the related investment management contracts 
shareholder servicing fees are generally calculated based on the number and type of accounts serviced while distribution fees are generally based on a percentage of aum 

table of contents aum of sips is calculated using fair value methods derived primarily from unadjusted quoted market prices  unadjusted independent third party broker or dealer price quotes in active markets  or market prices or price quotes adjusted for observable price movements after the close of the primary market 
the fair values of securities for which market prices are not readily available are internally valued using various methodologies which incorporate unobservable inputs as appropriate for each security type 
the pricing of the securities held by sips is governed by our global valuation and pricing policy  which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type  including practices for responding to unexpected or unusual market events 
as of september   our total aum by fair value hierarchy level was level  level and level as substantially all of our aum is valued based on observable market prices or inputs  market risk is the most significant risk underlying the valuation of our aum 
while recent economic conditions have resulted in ongoing market price volatility  the fair value of substantially all of the securities held by sips continues to be derived from observable market inputs 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
we recognize the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties in other operating expenses 
as a multi national corporation  we operate in various locations outside the us and generate earnings from our us subsidiaries 
we indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries  except for income previously taxed in the us  subject to regulatory or legal repatriation restrictions or requirements  and the excess net earnings reduced by cash needs for operational and regulatory capital requirements  capital management plans and capital expenditure plans of our canadian and uk consolidated subsidiaries 
as a result  we have not recognized a provision for us income taxes and a deferred income tax liability on billion of cumulative undistributed non us earnings that are indefinitely reinvested at september  changes to our policy of reinvestment or repatriation of non us earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business 
when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter  we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time 
in management s opinion  an adequate accrual has been made as of september  to provide for probable losses that may arise from these matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to market risk  including  but not limited to  potential loss due to changes in the value of financial instruments including those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and market valuation 
financial instruments include  but are not limited to  investment securities  loans  deposits and debt obligations 
management is responsible for managing market risk 

table of contents our enterprise risk management committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify  assess  and manage market and other risks 
our market risk from assets and liabilities of consolidated vies and consolidated sips is limited to that of our direct investments in  and management fees earned from  these entities 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities of our consolidated vies and consolidated sips are excluded from the discussion below 
aum market price risk we are exposed to market risk through our investment management and distribution fees  which are generally calculated as a percentage of the market value of aum 
changes in equity market prices  interest rates  credit spreads  foreign exchange rates  or a combination of these factors could cause the value of aum to decline  which would result in lower investment management and distribution fees 
our exposure to these risks is minimized as we sponsor a broad range of investment products in various global jurisdictions  which serves to mitigate the impact of changes in any particular market s or region s 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily through our investments in debt securities  loans receivable  deposits and debt obligations 
at september   we had exposure from  million of investments in debt securities and sips that invest in debt securities  million of net loans receivable and million of interest bearing deposits 
we minimize the impact of changes in interest rates related to investments in debt securities by managing the maturities of these securities  and through diversification  ensuring an appropriate mix of fixed rate and floating rate investments 
our exposure to the risks from investments in sips is also minimized by our broad range of products in various global jurisdictions  mitigating the impact of changes in any particular market s or region s 
we minimize the impact of changes in interest rates related to our debt obligations by entering into financing transactions that ensure an appropriate mix of debt at fixed and variable interest rates 
at september   all of our outstanding debt was issued at fixed rates 
in addition  we monitor the interest rates and average maturities of our loan and deposit portfolios 
as of september   we have considered the potential impact of a basis point movement in market interest rates on our interest earning cash and cash equivalents  portfolio of debt securities  loans receivable  deposits and debt obligations 
based on our analysis  we do not expect that such a change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in the next twelve months  for any of these categories or in the aggregate 
foreign currency exchange risk we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk through our international operations 
while we operate primarily in the us  we also provide services and earn revenues in the bahamas  asia pacific  europe  canada  latin america  the middle east and africa 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is minimized in relation to our results of operations since a significant portion of these revenues is denominated in us dollars 
this situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the us and expenses incurred denominated in foreign currencies increase 
the exposure to foreign currency exchange risk in our consolidated balance sheet mostly relates to cash and cash equivalents and investments that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily in euro  indian rupee  pound sterling  and canadian dollar 
these assets accounted for approximately of total cash and cash equivalents and investments at september  we also have exposure to foreign exchange revaluation of us dollar balances held by certain non us subsidiaries for which their local currency is the functional currency 
these assets accounted for approximately of total cash and cash equivalents and investments at september  we generally do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risk exposure 
as a result  both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar may affect our results of operations and accumulated other comprehensive income
