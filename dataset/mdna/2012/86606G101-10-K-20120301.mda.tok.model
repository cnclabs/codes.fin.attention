description of business we are a billion community based financial services company providing a full range of banking and other financial services to individuals and businesses through our two operating segments community banking and insurance 
our community bank  summit community bank  has a total of banking offices located in west virginia and virginia 
in addition  we also operate an insurance agency  summit insurance services  llc with an office in moorefield  west virginia which offers both commercial and personal lines of insurance and two offices in leesburg  virginia  primarily specializing in group health  life and disability benefit plans 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for our segment information 
summit financial group  inc employs approximately full time equivalent employees 
overview our primary source of income is net interest income from loans and deposits 
business volumes tend to be influenced by the overall economic factors including market interest rates  business spending  and consumer confidence  as well as competitive conditions within the marketplace 
key items in net income for totaled  compared to net loss of  in net income was achieved in despite charges related to the writedowns of oreo properties to fair value and other than temporary impairments of securities 
our allowance for loan losses totaled of total loans at december   compared to at december   with our provision for loan losses totaling million in compared to million during in  nonperforming assets increased by million 
we continue to manage our problem assets through a combination of asset sales  loan workouts and charge offs 
however  disposition of foreclosed real estate remains difficult to achieve as the return of our real estate markets to normal activity levels has been slow 
the impact of foregone net interest income from nonaccruing loans negatively impacted the margin keeping it well below historical margins 
during  we reduced wholesale funding to of total assets  compared to a year ago 
we issued  shares of series noncumulative convertible preferred stock  representing million of new capital 
we remained well capitalized by regulatory capital guidelines at december   with our leverage ratio at its highest level in five years and our total risk based capital ratio at its highest level in eleven years 

table of contents outlook summit remains well capitalized and is adequately reserved 
the company has adequate liquidity and is positioned to weather the current economic conditions and maintain marginal profitability until conditions improve 
in the short term  however  management anticipates the company will continue to be negatively impacted by loan losses above historical averages  continuing high levels of nonperforming assets  a weak economy  and modest reductions in total assets and revenues 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the financial services industry 
application of these principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
our most significant accounting policies are presented in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  we have identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of goodwill  fair value measurements  and other real estate owned oreo valuations to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on our consolidated balance sheet 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would negatively impact earnings in future periods 
note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the asset quality section of this financial review 
goodwill goodwill is subject to a two step impairment test by reporting unit at least annually to determine whether write downs of the recorded balances are necessary 
during the third quarter  we completed the required annual impairment test for for each of our reporting units  community banking and insurance services 
the first step step of impairment testing requires a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value to identify potential impairment 
if the fair value equals or exceeds the related unit s carrying value  no write down of recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  an expense may be required on our books to write down the goodwill to the proper carrying value 
the second step step of impairment testing is necessary only if the reporting unit does not pass step step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill that is recognized in a business combination 
the fair value  carrying amount and allocated goodwill with regard to each of our reporting units as of september  date of our most recent goodwill impairment test were as follows dollars in thousands community banking insurance services fair value carrying amount allocated goodwill neither of our reporting units failed step of the goodwill impairment tests conducted as of september  for purposes of these goodwill impairment tests  the following methodologies were utilized and key assumptions were made in determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
table of contents community banking we performed an internal valuation utilizing the income approach to determine the fair value of our community banking reporting unit 
the income approach was based on discounted cash flows derived from assumptions of balances sheet and income statement activity based upon an internally developed forecast considering several long term key business drivers such as anticipated loan and deposit growth 
the long term growth rate used in determining the terminal value was estimated at  and a discount rate of based upon the capital asset pricing model was applied to the bank s estimated future cash flow streams 
insurance services we performed an internal valuation  which was verified by a third party firm  utilizing the income approach to determine the fair value of our insurance services reporting unit 
this methodology consisted of discounting the expected future cash flows of this unit based upon a forecast of its operations considering long term key business drivers such as anticipated commission revenue growth 
the long term growth rate used in determining the terminal value was estimated at  and a discount rate of was applied to the insurance services unit s estimated future cash flows 
we cannot assure you that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our intangible assets  which include goodwill 
fair value measurements asc topic fair value measurements provides a definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
based on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation techniques  we classify our financial assets and liabilities measured and disclosed at fair value in accordance with the three level hierarchy eg  level  level and level established under asc topic fair value determination in accordance with asc topic requires that we make a number of significant judgments 
in determining the fair value of financial instruments  we use market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available 
we do not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain  then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses 
these modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability  including assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance 
fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
additionally  fair value is used on a non recurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with asc topic  financial instruments 
oreo valuations at december   we had oreo totaling  which is carried on the balance sheet at the lower of the investment in the real estate or its fair value less estimated selling costs 
the fair value of oreo is determined generally utilizing current as is appraisals performed by an independent  licensed appraiser applying an income or market value approach using observable market data 
updated appraisals of oreo are generally obtained if the existing appraisal is more than months old  or more frequently if there is a known deterioration in value 
however  if a current appraisal is not available  the original appraised value is discounted  as appropriate  to compensate for the estimated depreciation in the value of the real estate since the date of its original appraisal 
such discounts are generally estimated based upon management s knowledge of sales of similar property within the applicable market area and its knowledge of other real estate market related data as well as general economic trends 
upon foreclosure  any fair value adjustment is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred and included in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income 
deferred income tax assets at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
based on our ability to offset the net deferred tax asset against expected future taxable income in carryforward years  there was no impairment of the deferred tax asset at december  all available evidence  both positive and negative  was considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  impairment should be recognized 
however  our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change 
if our forecast of taxable income within the carryback carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets  such assets may become impaired 
business segment results we are organized and managed along two major business segments  as described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the results of each business segment are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand alone business

a summary of the significant factors influencing our results of operations and related ratios is included in the following discussion 
net interest income the major component of our net earnings is net interest income  which is the excess of interest earned on earning assets over the interest expense incurred on interest bearing sources of funds 
net interest income is affected by changes in volume  resulting from growth and alterations of the balance sheet s composition  fluctuations in interest rates and maturities of sources and uses of funds 
we seek to maximize net interest income through management of our balance sheet components 
this is accomplished by determining the optimal product mix with respect to yields on assets and costs of funds in light of projected economic conditions  while maintaining portfolio risk at an acceptable level 
net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis average balance sheet amounts  and corresponding average yields on interest earning assets and costs of interest bearing liabilities for the years  and are presented in table i 
table ii presents  for the periods indicated  the changes in interest income and expense attributable to a changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior period rate and b changes in rate change in rate multiplied by prior period volume 
changes in interest income and expense attributable to both rate and volume have been allocated between the factors in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each 
net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis totaled   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively  representing an increase of in and a decrease of in during  the volumes of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities declined  but these reductions were more than offset by lower yields on both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the decrease was driven by reductions in interest earning assets  reflecting significantly weak demand for new loans and planned reductions in our balance sheet made to enhance our capital ratios 
total average earning assets decreased to  at december  from  at december  total average interest bearing liabilities decreased to  at december   compared to  at december  as identified in table ii  tax equivalent net interest income increased  in and decreased  during our net interest margin was for compared to and for and  respectively 
our net interest margin increased basis points in and decreased basis point in the continuing low interest rate environment throughout and has served to positively impact our net interest margin due to our liability sensitive balance sheet 
during  the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points  which more than offset the basis point decrease in the yield on interest earning assets while the cost of interest bearing funds decreased basis points in  which virtually offset the basis point reduction in the yield on interest earning assets 
late in third quarter  and into fourth quarter  we reduced or repriced over million of our higher rate long term borrowings which has had a favorable impact on our net interest margin by reducing our cost of funds 
see tables i and ii for further details regarding changes in volumes and rates of average assets and liabilities and how those changes affect our net interest income 
assuming no significant change in market interest rates  we anticipate a relatively stable net interest margin in the near term as we do not expect interest rates to rise in the near future  we do not expect significant growth in our interest earning assets  nor do we expect our nonperforming asset balances to decline significantly in the near future 
we continue to monitor the net interest margin through net interest income simulation to minimize the potential for any significant negative impact 
see the market risk management section for further discussion of the impact changes in market interest rates could have on us 
further analysis of our yields on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are presented in tables i and ii below

we have slowed our loan growth due to the current weakened economic conditions in our market areas and limited availability of new capital resources 
refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for our loan maturities and a discussion of our adjustable rate loans as of december  in the normal course of business  we make various commitments and incur certain contingent liabilities  which are disclosed in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements but not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
there have been no significant changes in these types of commitments and contingent liabilities and we do not anticipate any material losses as a result of these commitments

during  and  we took other than temporary non cash impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  related to certain nongovernment sponsored residential mortgage backed securities 
at december   we had million in unrealized losses related to residential mortgage backed securities issued by nongovernment sponsored entities 
we monitor the performance of the mortgages underlying these bonds 
although there has been some deterioration in collateral performance  we hold primarily senior tranches of each issue which provides protection against defaults 
we attribute the unrealized loss on these mortgage backed securities largely due to their current absence of liquidity 
we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until their fair value recovers or until maturity 
the mortgages in these asset pools have been made to borrowers with acceptable credit history and significant equity invested in their homes 
they are well diversified geographically 
nonetheless  significant further weakening of economic fundamentals coupled with significant increases in unemployment and substantial deterioration in the value of high end residential properties could extend distress to this borrower population 
this could increase default rates and put additional pressure on property values 
should these conditions occur  the value of these securities could decline further and trigger the recognition of additional other than temporary impairment charges 
at december   we did not own securities of any one issuer that were not issued by the us treasury or a us government agency that exceeded ten percent of shareholders equity

during  million of subordinated debt was issued to an unrelated institution  which bears a variable interest rate of month libor plus basis points  has a term of years 
asset quality due to continued recessionary economic conditions  borrowers have in many cases been unable to refinance their loans due to a range of factors including declining property values 
as a result  we have experienced higher delinquencies and nonperforming assets  particularly with regard to our construction development  residential real estate  and commercial real estate loan portfolios 
it is not known when the housing market will stabilize 
management anticipates loan delinquencies will remain higher than historical levels in the near term  and we anticipate that nonperforming assets will remain elevated for the foreseeable future

collateral value values are based upon recent external appraisal 
value is based upon current appraisal on the real estate and most recent estimate on business assets 
at december   we had approximately million of performing loans which we have identified as potential problem loans 
known information about possible credit problems of the related borrowers causes management to have concerns as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the current loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming at some time in the future 
management cannot predict the extent to which economic conditions may worsen or other factors which may impact borrowers and the potential problem loans 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that other loans will not become days or more past due  be placed on nonaccrual  or require increased allowance coverage and provision for loan losses 
refer to note  loans  for information regarding our past due loans 
we monitor our concentrations in higher risk lending areas in accordance with the interagency guidance for concentrations in commercial real estate lending issued in this guidance establishes concentration guidelines of of tier capital plus the allowance for loan and lease loss for lending in construction  land development  and other land loans 
it further establishes a guideline of of tier capital plus the allowance for loan and lease loss for lending in construction  land development and other land loans plus loans secured by non owner occupied non farm non residential properties 
as of december   summit community bank was within the recommended limits of and  respectively 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is comprised of three distinct reserve components specific reserves related to loans individually evaluated  quantitative reserves related to loans collectively evaluated  and qualitative reserves related to loans collectively evaluated 
a summary of the methodology we employ on a quarterly basis with respect to each of these components in order to evaluate the overall adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is as follows 
table of contents specific reserve for loans individually evaluated first  we identify loan relationships having aggregate balances in excess of  and that may also have credit weaknesses 
such loan relationships are identified primarily through our analysis of internal loan evaluations  past due loan reports  and loans adversely classified by regulatory authorities 
each loan so identified is then individually evaluated to determine whether it is impaired that is  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreement 
substantially all of our impaired loans are and historically have been collateral dependent  meaning repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely from the sale of the loan s underlying collateral 
for such loans  we measure impairment based on the fair value of the loan s collateral  which is generally determined utilizing current appraisals 
a specific reserve is established in an amount equal to the excess  if any  of the recorded investment in each impaired loan over the fair value of its underlying collateral  less estimated costs to sell 
our policy is to re evaluate the fair value of collateral dependent loans at least every twelve months unless there is a known deterioration in the collateral s value  in which case a new appraisal is obtained 
quantitative reserve for loans collectively evaluated second  we stratify the loan portfolio into the following ten loan pools land and land development  construction  commercial  commercial real estate owner occupied  commercial real estate non owner occupied  conventional residential mortgage  jumbo residential mortgage  home equity  consumer  and other 
loans within each pool are then further segmented between loans which were individually evaluated for impairment and not deemed to be impaired  larger balance loan relationships exceeding million which are assigned an internal risk rating in conjunction with our normal ongoing loan review procedures and smaller balance homogenous loans 
quantitative reserves relative to each loan pool are established as follows for all loan segments detailed above an allocation equaling of the respective pool s average month historical net loan charge off rate determined based upon the most recent twelve quarters is applied to the aggregate recorded investment in the pool of loans 
qualitative reserve for loans collectively evaluated third  we consider the necessity to adjust our average historical net loan charge off rates relative to each of the above ten loan pools for potential risks factors that could result in actual losses deviating from prior loss experience 
for example  if we observe a significant increase in delinquencies within the conventional mortgage loan pool above historical trends  an additional allocation to the average historical loan charge off rate is applied 
such qualitative risk factors considered are levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and term of loans  effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards  and other changes in lending policies  procedures  and practice  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff  national and local economic trends and conditions  industry conditions  and effects of changes in credit concentrations 
fluctuations in components of the allowance over the past year the components of the allowance have remained consistent 
the specific reserve for loans individually evaluated for impairment was  at december  compared to  at december  the fas asc topic contingencies or pool reserve totaled  as of december  compared to  as of december  relationship between allowance for loan losses  net charge offs and nonperforming loans in analyzing the relationship between the allowance for loan losses  net loan charge offs and nonperforming loans  it is helpful to understand the process of how loans are treated as they deteriorate over time 
reserves for loans are established at origination through the quantitative and qualitative reserve process discussed above 
charge offs  if necessary  are typically recognized in a period after the reserves were established 
if the previously established reserves exceed that needed to satisfactorily resolve the problem credit  a reduction in the overall level of the reserve could be recognized 
in summary  if loan quality deteriorates  the typical credit sequence is periods of reserve building  followed by periods of higher net charge offs 
consumer loans are generally charged off to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency  in accordance with the federal financial institutions examination council policy 
for example  credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes days past due or within days from receiving notification about a specified event eg  bankruptcy of the borrower  whichever is earlier 
residential mortgage loans are generally charged off to net realizable value no later than when the account becomes days past due 
other consumer loans  if collateralized  are generally charged off to net realizable value at days past due 

table of contents commercial related loans which are risk rated are charged off to the allowance for loan losses when the loss has been confirmed 
this determination includes many factors  including the prioritization of our claim in bankruptcy  expectations of the workout restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower s equity 
substantially all of our nonperforming loans are secured by real estate 
the substantial majority of these loans were underwritten in accordance with our loan to value policy guidelines which range from at the time of origination 
although property values have deteriorated across our market areas  the fair values of the underlying collateral value remains in excess of the recorded investment in many of our nonperforming loans  and therefore  no specific reserve allocation is required  as of december   approximately of our impaired loans required no reserves or have been charged down to their fair value 
accordingly  our allowance for loan losses has not increased proportionately as our nonperforming loans have increased 
the allowance for loan loss will  however  increase as a result of an increase in net loan charge offs due to the incremental higher historical net charge off rate applied to the loans which are collectively evaluated for impairment 
at december  and  our allowance for loan losses totaled  or of total loans and  or of total loans  respectively  and is considered adequate to cover our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio

although foreclosed property is recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell  the prices ultimately realized upon their sale may or may not result in us recognizing loss 
liquidity and capital resources bank liquidity liquidity reflects our ability to ensure the availability of adequate funds to meet loan commitments and deposit withdrawals  as well as provide for other transactional requirements 
liquidity is provided primarily by funds invested in cash and due from banks net of float and reserves  federal funds sold  non pledged securities  and available lines of credit with the federal home loan bank  which totaled approximately  or of total consolidated assets at december  our liquidity strategy is to fund loan growth with deposits and other borrowed funds while maintaining an adequate level of short and medium term investments to meet normal daily loan and deposit activity 
core deposits increased million in  while loans decreased approximately million 
this allowed us to pay down long term fhlb borrowings  and to reduce our brokered certificates of deposit by not renewing them at maturity 
as a member of the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  we have access to approximately million 
as of december  and  these advances totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
at december   we had additional borrowing capacity of million through fhlb programs 
we have established a line with the federal reserve bank to be used as a contingency liquidity vehicle 
the amount available on this line at december  was approximately million  which is secured by a pledge of our consumer and commercial and industrial loan portfolios 
also  we classify all of our securities as available for sale to enable us to liquidate them if the need arises 
liquidity risk represents the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external market issues  customer or creditor perception of financial strength  and events unrelated to summit such as war  terrorism  or financial institution market specific issues 
the asset liability management committee alco  comprised of members of senior management and certain members of the board of directors  oversees our liquidity risk management process 
the alco develops and recommends policies and limits governing our liquidity to the board of directors for approval with the objective of ensuring that we can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations  as well as maintain sufficient levels of on hand liquidity  under both normal and stressed circumstances 
one aspect of our liquidity management process is establishing contingency liquidity funding plans under various scenarios in order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages or events 
the following represents three stressed liquidity circumstances and our related contingency plans with respect to each 
scenario summit community s capital status becomes less than well capitalized 
banks which are less than well capitalized in accordance with regulatory capital guidelines are prohibited from issuing new brokered deposits without first obtaining a waiver from the fdic to do so 
in the event summit community s capital status were to fall below well capitalized and was not successful in obtaining the fdic s waiver to issue new brokered deposits  summit community would have limited amounts of maturing brokered deposits to replace in the short term  as we have limited our brokered deposits maturing in any one quarter to no more than million 
presently has million in available sources of liquid funds which could be drawn upon to fund maturing brokered deposits until summit community had restored its capital to well capitalized status 
would first seek to restore its capital to well capitalized status through capital contributions from summit  its parent holding company 
summit has present cash reserves in excess of million available for capital infusion into summit community 
would generally have no more than million in brokered deposits maturing in any one year time frame  which is well within its presently available sources of liquid funds  if in the event summit does not have the capital resources to restore summit community s capital to well capitalized status 
one year would give summit community ample time to raise alternative funds either through retail deposits or the sale of assets  and obtain capital resources to restore it to well capitalized status 
scenario summit community s credit quality deteriorates such that the fhlb restricts further advances 
if in the event that the bank s credit quality deteriorated to the point that further advances under its line with the fhlb were restricted  summit community would severely curtail lending and other growth activities until such time as access to this line could be restored  thus eliminating the need for net new advances 
would still have available current liquid funding sources totaling million aside from its fhlb line and  in addition  would have available currently almost million unpledged government agency securities debentures and mortgage backed securities that are available for use in repurchase arrangements with institutional broker and would result in a funding source of at least million to meet unforeseen liquidity needs 

table of contents scenario a competitive financial institution offers a retail deposit program at interest rates significantly above current market rates in the summit community s market areas 
if a competitive financial institution offered a retail deposit program at rates well in excess of current market rates in the summit community s market area  the bank presently has million in available sources of liquid funds which could be drawn upon immediately to fund any net run off of deposits from this activity 
would severely curtail lending and other growth activities so as to preserve the availability of as much contingency funds as possible 
would begin offering its own competitive deposit program when deemed prudent so as to restore the retail deposits lost to the competition 
we continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that day to day as well as anticipated funding needs are met 
we are not aware of any trends  commitments  events or uncertainties that have resulted in or are reasonably likely to result in a material change to our liquidity 
growth and expansion during  we spent approximately million on capital expenditures for premises and equipment 
we expect our capital expenditures to approximate million in  primarily for equipment upgrades 
management anticipates that the company s near term level of assets will remain stable or even decline slightly in comparison with that of recent prior years due to the present recessionary economic environment 
capital compliance our capital position has significantly improved 
this is primarily attributable to an increase in retained earnings due to our return to profitability in  a decline in total assets  and various capital raises over the past three years 
stated as a percentage of total assets  our equity ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
at december   we had tier risk based  total risk based and tier leverage capital in excess of the minimum levels required to be considered well capitalized of million  million  and million  respectively 
our subsidiary bank  summit community bank  had tier risk based  total risk based and tier leverage capital in excess of the minimum well capitalized levels of million  million  and million  respectively 
we intend to maintain both summit s and its subsidiary bank s capital ratios at levels that would be considered to be well capitalized in accordance with regulatory capital guidelines 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our regulatory capital 
during  we issued million in subordinated debentures  of which million was issued to an affiliate of a director of summit 
we also issued million and million to two unrelated parties 
these three issuances bear an interest rate of percent per annum  have a term of years  and are not prepayable by us within the first five years 
during  we issued million of subordinated debentures 
this debt has an interest rate of month libor plus basis points  a term of years  and is not prepayable by us within the first two and a half years 
these subordinated debentures qualify as tier capital until they are within years of maturity  thereafter the amount qualifying as tier capital is reduced by percent each year until maturity 
on september   we issued million of non cumulative convertible preferred stock and during fourth quarter  we issued an additional million of non cumulative convertible preferred stock 
issuance of trust preferred securities under federal reserve board guidelines  we had the ability to issue an additional million of trust preferred securities as of december  that would qualify as tier regulatory capital to support our future growth 
trust preferred securities issuances in excess of this limit generally may be included in tier capital 
dividends there were no cash dividends paid on common shares in or future cash dividends will depend on the earnings  and financial condition of our subsidiary bank and our capital adequacy as well as general economic conditions 
as discussed below under regulatory matters  we are presently restricted from paying cash dividends on our common stock 
the primary source of funds for the dividends paid to our shareholders is dividends received from our subsidiary bank 
dividends paid by our subsidiary bank are subject to restrictions by banking law and regulations and require approval by the bank s regulatory agency if dividends declared in any year exceed the bank s current year s net income  as defined  plus its retained net profits of the two preceding years 
presently  as a result of the current bank mou  the bank is required to give days prior written notice of its intent to pay any cash dividends to its regulatory authorities to give regulatory authorities an opportunity to object 
regulatory matters summit and the bank have entered into informal memoranda of understanding mou s with their respective regulatory authorities 
a memorandum of understanding is characterized by the regulatory authorities as an informal action that is not published or publicly available and that is used when circumstances warrant a milder form of action than a formal supervisory action  such as a formal written agreement or order 
among other things  under the mou s  summit s management team has agreed to 
table of contents the bank achieving and maintaining a minimum tier leverage capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least the bank providing days prior notice of any declaration of intent to pay cash dividends to provide the bank s regulatory authorities an opportunity to object  summit suspending all cash dividends on its common stock until further notice 
dividends on all preferred stock  as well as interest payments on subordinated notes underlying summit s trust preferred securities  continue to be permissible  and  summit not incurring any additional debt  other than trade payables  without the prior written consent of the principal banking regulators 
the bank mou was amended effective february   to include additional requirements that management review overall liquidity objectives and develop and submit to regulatory authorities plans and procedures aimed to improve liquidity and reduce reliance on volatile liabilities  and perform a risk segmentation analysis of concentrations of credit and develop plan to reduce any segment of the portfolio which regulatory authorities deem to be an undue concentration of credit 
management presently believes summit and the bank are in compliance with all provisions of the mous 
contractual cash obligations during our normal course of business  we incur contractual cash obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december  table xiii contractual cash obligations dollars in thousands long term debt and subordinated debentures operating leases thereafter total off balance sheet arrangements we are involved with some off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition  liquidity  or capital

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
interest rate risk is our primary market risk and results from timing differences in the repricing of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  changes in relationships between rate indices and the potential exercise of embedded options 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to minimize interest rate risk and our actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of our asset liability management committee alco 
the alco is comprised of members of senior management and members of the board of directors 
the alco actively formulates the economic assumptions that we use in our financial planning and budgeting process and establishes policies which control and monitor our sources  uses and prices of funds 
some amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate to the banking business 
our net income is affected by changes in the absolute level of interest rates 
at december   our interest rate risk position was liability sensitive 
that is  liabilities are likely to reprice faster than assets  resulting in a decrease in net interest income in a rising rate environment  while a falling interest rate environment would produce an increase in net interest income 
net interest income is also subject to changes in the shape of the yield curve 
in general  a flat yield curve results in a decline in our earnings due to the compression of earning asset yields and funding rates  while a steepening would result in increased earnings as margins widen 
several techniques are available to monitor and control the level of interest rate risk 
we primarily use earnings simulations modeling to monitor interest rate risk 
the earnings simulation model forecasts the effects on net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
each increase or decrease in rates is assumed to gradually take place over a month period  and then remain stable  except for the up scenario  which assumes a gradual increase in rates over months 
assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits are derived from historical analysis 
securities portfolio maturities and prepayments are reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry estimates of prepayment speeds 
noncontractual deposit repricings are modeled on historical patterns 
the following table presents the estimated sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in interest rates  as measured by our earnings simulation model as of december  the sensitivity is measured as a percentage change in net interest income given the stated changes in interest rates gradual change over months  stable thereafter for the up and down and the up scenarios  and gradual change over months for the up scenario compared to net interest income with rates unchanged in the same period 
the estimated changes set forth below are dependent on the assumptions discussed above and are well within our alco policy limit  which is a reduction in net interest income over the ensuing twelve month period 
change in estimated change in net interest rates interest income over basis points months months down up up up assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve over months assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve over months
