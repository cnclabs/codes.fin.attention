all estimates referred to in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to the company s estimates as of november  executive overview consolidated net sales increased million  or  to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal replacement driven demand in the access equipment segment  coupled with a slow economic recovery in the united states  resulted in a significant increase in sales in both the access equipment and commercial segments  which more than offset an expected decrease in defense sales as us defense spending for tactical wheeled vehicles declined and is expected to continue to decline for the next few years 
while sales were higher  consolidated operating income in fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal to million  or of sales 
the decrease in consolidated operating income was primarily attributable to the defense segment  which experienced a shift from higher margin family of heavy tactical vehicles fhtv and mrap all terrain vehicle m atv parts sales to lower margin family of medium tactical vehicles fmtv sales

despite efforts by numerous dedicated individuals and teams  the business continued to operate at a loss and it became apparent that the medtec product line would not achieve profitability in a reasonable time frame  if at all  and as a result  the company made a decision to exit the business 
upon completion of on hand medtec orders  the company will exit the ambulance business and reclassify medtec historical operating results to discontinued operations 
with the decision made to exit these businesses  the company was able to focus on improving operational performance of its principal product lines  which drove the fire emergency segment to operating income of million  or of sales  in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  the company completed a comprehensive strategic planning process to  among other things  assess the outlook for each of its markets  consider strategic alternatives and develop strategic initiatives to address the current difficult market forces then facing the company 
those difficult market forces involved non defense markets  which were down to more than from peak  an uncertain economic recovery and a likely sharp downturn in us defense spending beginning in the study culminated in the creation of the company s planned roadmap to deliver superior long term earnings growth and increased shareholder value over the next business cycle and beyond 
the company s roadmap  named move  entails aggressive cost reduction and prudent organic growth initiatives until a market recovery provides an opportunity for both significant earnings leverage and cash flow at which time the company s strategic options could expand 
by focusing on its move strategy  the company is targeting earnings per share of to in fiscal the move strategy consists of four key strategic initiatives market recovery and growth the company believes that the recovery in certain of its non defense markets began in fiscal the company has plans to capture or improve its historical share of a market recovery

the company is targeting basis points of operating income improvement between fiscal and through this initiative 
the company achieved an eight basis point improvement in operating income margins in fiscal from this initiative and expects that the actions implemented in fiscal will result in basis points of a targeted basis point operating income margin improvement for all of fiscal from this initiative 
the company has also announced a prudent capital allocation strategy to be implemented over the next several years  which the company expects to incrementally benefit earnings as well as returns for shareholders 
to this effect  the company repurchased  shares of common stock during the fourth quarter of fiscal at a cost of million 
on november   the company s board of directors increased the company s stock repurchase authorization such that the company had authority to repurchase  shares of common stock after the board action 
the company is targeting spending million to repurchase shares over the to months following that date and expects to spend at least million to repurchase shares over the three months following that date 
value innovation the company plans to further strengthen its multi generational product plans  which incorporate its newest technologies  to drive increased demand for the company s products and increased penetration into new markets globally 
the company is targeting million of incremental annual revenue by fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of this initiative 
emerging market expansion the company plans to drive expansion in international targeted geographies where it believes that there are significant opportunities for growth 
the company is targeting to derive more than of its revenues from outside the us by fiscal 
table of contents the company is in the early stages of implementing many of its move initiatives 
the company expects the investments that it made in its move strategy in fiscal to drive an improved cost structure  support the company s drive for continued product innovation leadership and expand the company s international sales in future years 
as a result of the move strategy  in fiscal the company was able to capture a larger portion of the access equipment recovery  turn the fmtv contract to profitability in all four fiscal quarters  exit underperforming businesses and increase international sales by compared to fiscal to of consolidated sales 
these actions led to oshkosh significantly beating wall street consensus earnings estimates for each quarter of fiscal over the next few years  the company believes the effective execution of its move strategy will permit the company to overcome the impact of lower us defense spending for tactical wheeled vehicles on its defense segment and report strong earnings growth and improved returns for shareholders 
the benefits of the move strategy are evident in the company s outlook for fiscal  as despite a projected decrease in consolidated sales of to as compared to fiscal  the company expects operating income margins to improve basis points 
the company s sales estimate assumes stable to slightly higher sales in its non defense segments  as a result of a slow economic recovery in the united states  coupled with an approximate decline in defense segment sales 
the improved operating income margins lead the company to believe that earnings from continuing operations will be to per share in fiscal this estimate does not consider any costs  which may be substantial  associated with the offer as defined below and related threatened proxy contest discussed below 
the company believes its first quarter of fiscal will be the lowest quarter of the year in terms of sales and earnings per share  driven by seasonality of the company s non defense businesses and the expectation that the company will not begin to recognize revenue from m atv sales to the uae until the second fiscal quarter

table of contents fiscal outlook the company believes that consolidated sales will decrease to in fiscal compared to fiscal this estimate assumes stable to slightly higher sales in the company s non defense segments  as a result of a slow economic recovery in the united states  coupled with an approximate decline in defense segment sales 
the company is confident that its move strategy will be a significant contributor to its results in fiscal  leading to a consolidated operating income margin approximately basis points higher in fiscal than in fiscal the company believes that earnings from continuing operations will be to per share in fiscal this estimate does not consider any costs  which may be substantial  associated with the offer and related threatened proxy contest that were launched in october the company believes access equipment segment sales will be between billion and billion in fiscal in spite of orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal that were lower than the prior year quarter  customer equipment utilization rates and fleet ages  as well as used equipment values  remain high for access equipment 
the company expects operating income margins in the access equipment segment will be in the to range  reflecting the progress this segment is making in recovering from the depths of the great recession 
the company expects sales in its defense segment to be between billion and billion in fiscal as a result of lower fmtv and aftermarket part sales 
the company expects operating income margins for this segment to be to  reflecting the decrease in sales on a relatively fixed cost base 
the company believes fire emergency segment sales will be between million and million in fiscal  reflecting the expected bottoming of the united states fire apparatus market 
the company believes operating income margins in the fire emergency segment will be between and in fiscal  reflecting the exit of the ambulance business and continued improved performance  offset by investments in the company s move strategy 
the company expects sales in the commercial segment will also be in the range of million to million in fiscal  largely driven by expected higher concrete mixer sales as housing starts appear to be gaining momentum 
the company believes operating income margins in the segment will be approximately to in fiscal  reflecting the benefit of higher sales volumes largely offset by investments in the move strategy 
the company believes that corporate expenses in fiscal will be up slightly as compared to fiscal due to further investments in information technology 
the company estimates its effective income tax rate for fiscal will be 
the company believes its first quarter of fiscal will be the lowest quarter of the year in terms of sales and earnings per share  driven by seasonality of the company s non defense businesses and the expectation that the company will not begin to recognize revenue from m atv sales to the uae until the second fiscal quarter 
the company believes that it will generate free cash flow of million to million in fiscal this estimate includes the company s expectation of strong free cash flow in the access equipment segment and cash usage in the remaining three segments 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue on equipment and parts sales when contract terms are met  collectability is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer 
revenue from service agreements is recognized as earned  when services have been rendered 
appropriate provisions are made for discounts  returns and sales allowances 
sales are recorded net of amounts invoiced for taxes imposed on the customer such as excise or value added taxes 

table of contents sales to the us government of non commercial products manufactured to the government s specifications are recognized using the units of delivery measure under the percentage of completion accounting method as units are accepted by the government 
the company includes amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
the company charges anticipated losses on contracts or programs in progress to earnings when identified 
approximately of the company s revenues for fiscal were recognized under the percentage of completion accounting method 
the company accounts for certain equipment lease contracts as sales type leases 
the present value of all payments  net of executory costs such as legal fees  is recorded as revenue  the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales  certain profit is deferred in accordance with lease accounting rules and interest income is recognized over the terms of the leases using the effective interest method 
the company enters into rental purchase guarantee agreements with some of its customers 
these agreements are normally for a term of no greater than twelve months and provide for rental payments with a guaranteed purchase at the end of the agreement 
at the inception of the agreement  the company records the full amount due under the agreement as revenue and the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales 
sales incentives 
the terms for sales transactions with some of the company s distributors and customers may include specific volume based incentives  which are calculated and paid or credited on account as a percentage of actual sales 
the company accounts for these incentives as sales discounts at the time of revenue recognition  which are recorded as a direct reduction of sales 
the company reviews its accrual for sales incentives on a quarterly basis and any adjustments are reflected in current earnings 
impairment of long lived and amortized intangible assets 
the company performs impairment evaluations of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the long lived assets  the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the company performs its annual review at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the fair value of the businesses to which the goodwill relates 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or  under certain circumstances  a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business 
when the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  a further analysis is performed to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
impairment losses  limited to the carrying value of goodwill  represent the excess of the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the company evaluates the recoverability of indefinite lived trade names  based upon a relief from royalty method 
this methodology determines the fair value of each trade name through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate the company would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular trade name 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  the company considers projected future sales  a fair market royalty rate for each applicable trade name and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
such events may include  but are not limited to  the impact of the economic environment  a material negative change in relationships with significant customers  or strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions 
see critical accounting estimates 
guarantees of the indebtedness of others 
the company enters into agreements with finance companies whereby the company will guarantee the indebtedness of third party end users to whom the finance company lends to purchase the company s equipment 
in some instances  the company retains an obligation to the finance companies in the event the customer defaults on the financing 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  guarantees  the company recognizes the greater of the fair value of the guarantee or the contingent liability required by fasb asc topic  contingencies 
reserves are initially established related to these guarantees at the fair value of the guarantee based upon the company s understanding of the current financial 
table of contents position of the underlying customers and based on estimates and judgments made from information available at that time 
if the company becomes aware of deterioration in the financial condition of the customer borrower or of any impairment of the customer borrower s ability to make payments  additional allowances are considered 
although the company may be liable for the entire amount of a customer borrower s financial obligation under guarantees  its losses would generally be mitigated by the value of any underlying collateral including financed equipment  the finance company s inability to provide clear title of foreclosed equipment to the company  loss pools established in accordance with the agreements and other conditions 
during periods of economic downturn  the value of the underlying collateral supporting these guarantees can decline sharply to further increase losses in the event of a customer borrower s default 
critical accounting estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management of the company has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosures relating to such estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
definitization of undefinitized contracts 
the company recognizes revenue on undefinitized contracts with the dod to the extent that it can reasonably and reliably estimate the expected final contract price and when collectability is reasonably assured 
undefinitized contracts are used when the company and the dod have not agreed upon all contract terms before the company begins performance under the contracts 
at september   the company had recorded million in revenue on contracts that remain undefinitized 
to the extent that contract definitization results in changes or adjustments to previously recognized revenues or estimated or incurred costs  including charges from subcontractors  the company records those adjustments as a change in estimate in the period of change 
the company definitized certain defense segment contracts during fiscal and recorded operating income of million related to previously recorded revenue 
as the costs associated with these contracts had been previously expensed  the change increased net income by million or per share 
in fiscal  the company updated its estimated costs under several undefinitized change orders and recorded million of operating income related to such updates 
as all costs associated with these contracts had been previously expensed  the change increased net income by million or per share 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to estimate a customer s ability to satisfy its obligations 
the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is particularly critical in the company s access equipment segment where the majority of the company s trade receivables are recorded 
the company evaluates the collectability of receivables based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
additional reserves are established based upon the company s perception of the quality of the current receivables  including the length of time the receivables are past due  past experience of collectability and underlying economic conditions 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional reserves would be required 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  it is necessary to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the estimate of the fair value of the reporting units is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows and a market approach 
in estimating the fair value  management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows  future revenues  future earnings and other factors 
the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
the rate used to discount estimated cash flows is a rate corresponding to the company s cost of capital  adjusted for risk where appropriate  and is dependent upon interest rates at a point in time 
the company weighted the income approach more heavily as the income approach uses long term estimates that consider the expected operating profit of each reporting unit during periods where residential and non residential construction and other macroeconomic indicators are nearer historical averages 
the company believes the income approach more accurately considers the expected recovery in the us and european construction markets than the market approach 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
it is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner to cause further impairment of goodwill  which could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 

table of contents at july   approximately of the company s recorded goodwill and indefinite lived purchased intangibles were concentrated within the jlg reporting unit in the access equipment segment 
the impairment model assumes that the us economy and construction spending and hence access equipment demand will continue its slow improvement 
assumptions utilized in the impairment analysis are highly judgmental  especially given the severity and global scale of the most recent recession and the subjective assumptions regarding a recovery 
changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could have produced significantly different results 
while the company currently believes that an impairment of intangible assets at jlg is unlikely  events and conditions that could result in the impairment of intangibles at jlg include a sharp decline in economic conditions  pricing pressure on jlg s margins or other factors leading to reductions in expected long term sales or profitability at jlg 
at july   approximately of the company s recorded goodwill and indefinite lived purchased intangibles were concentrated within the pierce reporting unit in the fire emergency segment 
this reporting unit has been severely impacted by the decrease in municipal revenue during the past two years 
the company believes that municipal demand is stabilizing as its municipal orders increased in fiscal the company expects pierce sales to decline in fiscal as federal demand is expected to bottom and that pierce sales will begin a slow recovery starting in fiscal as municipal demand continues to rebound 
the impairment model assumes that the us economy will continue its slow improvement  reversing the recent trend of decreasing municipal tax revenues 
assumptions utilized in the impairment analysis are highly judgmental  especially given the severity and global scale of the most recent recession and the subjective assumptions regarding a recovery 
changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could have produced significantly different results 
while the company currently believes that an impairment of intangible assets at pierce is unlikely  events and conditions that could result in the impairment of intangibles at pierce include a further decline in economic conditions or other factors leading to reductions in expected long term sales or profitability at pierce 
the company has no other reporting units that have material amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets that are at risk of impairment 
guarantees of the indebtedness of others 
the reserve for guarantees of the indebtedness of others requires management to estimate a customer s ability to satisfy its obligations 
the estimate is particularly critical in the company s access equipment segment where the majority of the company s guarantees are granted 
the company evaluates the reserve based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded in accordance with fasb asc topic  contingencies 
in most cases  the financing company is required to provide clear title to the equipment under the financing program 
the company considers the residual value of the equipment to reduce the amount of exposure 
residual values are estimated based upon recent auctions  used equipment sales and periodic studies performed by a third party 
additional reserves  based upon historical loss percentages  are established at the time of sale of the equipment based upon the requirement of fasb asc topic  guarantees 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional reserves would be required 
product liability 
due to the nature of the company s products  the company is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business 
a substantial portion of these claims and lawsuits involve the company s access equipment  concrete placement and refuse collection vehicle businesses  while such lawsuits in the company s defense and fire emergency businesses have historically been limited 
to the extent permitted under applicable law  the company maintains insurance to reduce or eliminate risk to the company 
most insurance coverage includes self insured retentions that vary by business segment and by year 
as of september   the company was generally self insured for future claims up to million per claim 
the company establishes product liability reserves for its self insured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and the company s ability to reasonably estimate such loss 
there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation 
the company makes estimates based on available information and the company s best judgment after consultation with appropriate experts 
the company periodically revises estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances 
the company also utilizes actuarial methodologies to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of the adverse development of claims over time 

table of contents warranty 
sales of the company s products generally carry typical explicit manufacturers warranties based on terms that are generally accepted in the company s marketplaces 
the company records provisions for estimated warranty and other related costs at the time of sale based on historical warranty loss experience and periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience 
certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
at times  warranty issues arise that are beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
the company provides for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable 
it is reasonably possible that from time to time additional warranty and other related claims could arise from disputes or other matters beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
the company s products generally carry explicit warranties that extend from six months to five years  based on terms that are generally accepted in the marketplace 
selected components included in the company s end products such as engines  transmissions  tires  etc 
may include manufacturers warranties 
these manufacturers warranties are generally passed on to the end customer of the company s products and the customer would generally deal directly with the component manufacturer 
the company s policy is to record a liability for the expected cost of warranty related claims at the time of the sale 
the amount of warranty liability accrued reflects management s best estimate of the expected future cost of honoring the company s obligations under the warranty plans 
the company believes that the warranty accounting estimate is a critical accounting estimate because changes in the warranty provision can materially affect net income  the estimate requires management to forecast estimated product usage levels by customers  in the case of new models  components or technology may be different  resulting in higher levels of warranty claims experience than with existing  mature products  and certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
the estimate for warranty obligations is a critical accounting estimate for each of the company s operating segments 
historically  the cost of fulfilling the company s warranty obligations has principally involved replacement parts  labor and sometimes travel for any field retrofit campaigns 
over the past three fiscal years  the company s warranty cost as a percentage of sales has ranged from of sales to of sales 
warranty costs tend to be higher shortly after new product introductions  especially those introductions involving new technologies  when field warranty campaigns may be necessary to correct or retrofit certain items 
accordingly  the company must make assumptions about the number and cost of anticipated field warranty campaigns 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience  the extent of pre production testing  the number of units involved and the extent of new features components included in new product models 
each quarter  the company reviews actual warranty claims experience to determine if there are any systemic defects that would require a field campaign 
also  based upon historical experience  warranty provision rates on new product introductions are established at higher than standard rates to reflect increased expected warranty costs associated with any new product introduction 
at times  warranty issues can arise which are beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
if the estimate of warranty costs in fiscal increased or decreased by basis points  the company s accrued warranty costs  costs of sales and operating income would each change by million or  and  respectively 
benefit plans 
the pension benefit obligation and related pension income are calculated in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation retirement benefits  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
the company s benefit plan assumptions are determined by using a benchmark approach as well as currently available actuarial data 
these rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance 
actuarial valuations at september  used a weighted average discount rate of and an expected return on plan assets of 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase annual pension expense by million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the company s annual pension expense by million 
the company s other postretirement benefits obligation and related expenses are calculated in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation retirement benefits  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including health care trend rates 
an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and would increase the annual service and interest cost by million 
a corresponding decrease of one percentage point would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and decrease the annual service and interest cost by million 

table of contents income taxes 
the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets 
the company records a valuation allowance  when appropriate  to adjust deferred tax asset balances to the amount management expects to realize 
management considers  as applicable  the amount of taxable income available in carryback years  future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes 
asc topic prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
asc topic also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  disclosure and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with asc topic is a two step process 
the first step is recognition  where the company evaluates whether an individual tax position has a likelihood of greater than of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are currently estimated to have a less than likelihood of being sustained  zero tax benefit is recorded 
for tax positions that have met the recognition threshold in the first step  the company performs the second step of measuring the benefit to be recorded 
the actual benefits ultimately realized may differ from the company s estimates 
in future periods  changes in facts and circumstances and new information may require the company to change the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions 
changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recorded in results of operations and financial position in the period in which such changes occur 
as of september   the company had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to uncertain tax positions totaling million 
new accounting standards refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting standards on the company s consolidated financial statements 
customers and backlog sales to the us government comprised approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal no other single customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales for this period 
a substantial majority of the company s net sales are derived from customer orders prior to commencing production 
the company s backlog as of september  decreased to billion compared to billion at september  access equipment segment backlog decreased to million at september  compared to million at september  backlog at september  included a very large  early cycle order and was also favorably impacted by anticipated capacity constraints in the industry 
defense segment backlog decreased to billion at september  compared to billion at september  due largely to the fulfillment of fhtv and fmtv orders and the delay in finalizing the fiscal us federal budget  which has delayed receipt of orders for the company s products 
fire emergency segment backlog decreased to million at september  compared to million at september  due in large part to the company no longer taking orders for medtec ambulances in connection with its decision to exit the medtec business 
commercial segment backlog increased to million at september  compared to million at september  unit backlog for concrete mixers was up compared to september  the company believes that aged fleets and recent increases in housing starts contributed to recent larger  multiple unit orders 
unit backlog for refuse collection vehicles was down at september  compared to september  prior year orders and backlog were positively impacted as customers scheduled delivery of units prior to the december  expiration of a us bonus tax depreciation deduction 
reported backlog excludes purchase options and announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed 
additionally  backlog excludes unfunded portions of the fhtv and fmtv contracts 
backlog information and comparisons thereof as of different dates may not be accurate indicators of future sales or the ratio of the company s future sales to the dod versus its sales to other customers 
approximately of the company s september  backlog is not expected to be filled in fiscal 
table of contents financial market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  certain commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
to reduce the risk from changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates  the company selectively uses financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
the company s earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to short term market interest rates 
the company  as needed  uses interest rate swaps to modify its exposure to interest rate movements 
the company did not have any outstanding interest rate swaps as of september  the portion of the company s interest expense not effectively fixed in the interest rate swap remains sensitive to changes in the interest rates in the us and off shore markets 
in this regard  changes in us and off shore interest rates affect interest payable on the company s borrowings under its credit agreement 
based on debt outstanding at september   a basis point increase or decrease in the average cost of the company s variable rate debt would increase or decrease annual pre tax interest expense by approximately million 
the table below provides information about the company s debt obligations  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates dollars in millions expected maturity date thereafter total fair value liabilities long term debt variable rate us average interest rate fixed rate us average interest rate the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
commodity price risk 
the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  including steel  aluminum and composites 
in addition  the company is a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities  including steel  aluminum  rubber and others which are integrated into the company s end products 
the company generally buys these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
the company does not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
the company generally obtains firm quotations from its suppliers for a significant portion of its orders under firm  fixed price contracts in its defense segment 
in the company s access equipment  fire emergency and commercial segments  the company generally attempts to obtain firm pricing from most of its suppliers  consistent with backlog requirements and or forecasted annual sales 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing from its suppliers  or its suppliers are not able to honor such prices  then the company may experience margin declines to the extent it is not able to increase selling prices of its products 

table of contents foreign currency risk 
the company s operations consist of manufacturing in the us  belgium  canada  france  australia  romania and china and sales and limited vehicle body mounting activities on six continents 
in addition  the company manufactures products through investments in joint ventures in mexico and brazil 
international sales comprised approximately of overall net sales in fiscal  of which approximately involved exports from the us the majority of export sales in fiscal were denominated in us dollars 
as a result of the manufacture and sale of the company s products in foreign markets  the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar  as compared to foreign currencies in which certain of the company s transactions in foreign markets are denominated 
the company s operating results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the european currencies  primarily the euro and the uk pound sterling  changes between the us dollar and the australian dollar  changes between the us dollar and the brazilian real and changes between the us dollar and the chinese renminbi 
through the company s foreign currency hedging activities  the company seeks to minimize the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of the company s products will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
the company enters into certain forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the company s foreign currency exchange risk 
these contracts qualify as derivative instruments under fasb asc topic  derivatives and hedging  however  the company has not designated all of these instruments as hedge transactions under asc topic accordingly  the mark to market impact of these derivatives is recorded each period to current earnings along with the offsetting foreign currency transaction gain loss recognized on the related balance sheet exposure 
at september   the company was managing million notional of foreign currency contracts  none of which were designated as accounting hedges and all of which settle within days 
the following table quantifies outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge non us dollar denominated cash  receivables and payables and the corresponding impact on the value of these instruments assuming a appreciation depreciation of the us dollar relative to all other currencies on september  dollars in millions foreign exchange gain loss from notional amount average contractual exchange rate fair value appreciation of us dollar depreciation of us dollar sell euro buy usd sell aud buy usd sell usd buy gbp sell gbp buy euro as previously noted  the company s policy prohibits the trading of financial instruments for speculative purposes or the use of leveraged instruments 
it is important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would be offset by gains and losses on the underlying receivables and payables
