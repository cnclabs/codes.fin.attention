item a 
risk factors 
our business  financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including the risk factors we have identified below 
these factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance 
we may amend or supplement the risk factors from time to time by other reports that we file with the sec in the future 
our industry is subject to intense competitive pressures 
we operate in markets that are highly competitive 
we compete on the basis of price  quality  service and or brand name across the industries and markets we serve 
competitive pressures could affect the prices we are able to charge our customers or the demand for our products 
we may not always be able to compete on price  particularly when compared to manufacturers with lower cost structures 
some of our competitors have substantially greater sales  financial and manufacturing resources and may have greater access to capital than littelfuse 
as other companies enter our markets or develop new products  competition may further intensify 
our failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to manufacture and deliver products in a manner that is responsive to our customers needs 
the end markets for our products are characterized by technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research  development and commercialization expenses on capital investments 
furthermore  the life cycles of our products may change and are difficult to estimate 
our future success will depend upon our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a manner that is responsive to our customers needs 
we will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address increasingly sophisticated requirements of our customers 
we invest heavily in research and development without knowing that we will recover these costs 
our competitors may develop products or technologies that will render our products non competitive or obsolete 
if we cannot develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost effective manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our business may be interrupted by labor disputes or other interruptions of supplies 
a work stoppage could occur at certain of our facilities  most likely as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements or in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements 
in addition  we may experience a shortage of supplies for various reasons  such as financial distress  work stoppages  natural disasters or production difficulties that may affect one of our suppliers 
a significant work stoppage  or an interruption or shortage of supplies for any reason  if protracted  could substantially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the transfer of our manufacturing operations and changes in our distribution model could disrupt operations for a limited time 
our revenues may vary significantly from period to period 
our revenues may vary significantly from one accounting period to another due to a variety of factors including changes in our customers buying decisions  changes in demand for our products  our product mix  our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes  costs and timing of our component purchases  the effectiveness of our inventory control  the degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity  our ability to meet delivery schedules  general economic and industry conditions  local conditions and events that may affect our production volumes  such as labor conditions and political instability  and seasonality of certain product lines 
the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could adversely affect us 
the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could result in lower sales revenue and cause a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major us auto manufacturer or significant supplier likely could lead to substantial disruptions in the automotive supply base  resulting in lower demand for our products  which likely would cause a decrease in sales revenue and have a substantial adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to manage currency or commodity price fluctuations or shortages is limited 
as a resource intensive manufacturing operation  we are exposed to a variety of market and asset risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
we have multiple sources of supply for the majority of our commodity requirements 
however  significant shortages that disrupt the supply of raw materials or result in price increases could affect prices we charge our customers  our product costs  and the competitive position of our products and services 
we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects on our results 
nevertheless  changes in currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates cannot always be predicted 
in addition  because of intense price competition and our high level of fixed costs  we may not be able to address such changes even if they are foreseeable 
substantial changes in these rates and prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for additional discussion of interest rate  currency or commodity price risk  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 
operations and supply sources located outside the united states  particularly in emerging markets  are subject to greater risks 
our operating activities outside the united states contribute significantly to our revenues and earnings 
serving a global customer base and remaining competitive in the global marketplace requires the company to place our production in countries outside the united states  including emerging markets  to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a cost efficient structure 
in addition  we source a significant amount of raw materials and other components from third party suppliers in low cost countries 
our international operating activities are subject to a number of risks generally associated with international operations  including risks relating to the following general economic conditions  currency fluctuations and exchange restrictions  import and export duties and restrictions  the imposition of tariffs and other import or export barriers  compliance with regulations governing import and export activities  current and changing regulatory requirements  political and economic instability  potentially adverse income tax consequences  transportation delays and interruptions  labor unrest  natural disasters  terrorist activities  public health concerns  difficulties in staffing and managing multi national operations  and limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are in the process of relocating our manufacturing operations and changing our distribution and customer service model 
we are a company that  from time to time  seeks to optimize its manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies through restructurings  consolidations  plant closings or asset sales 
we may make further specific determinations to consolidate  close or sell additional facilities 
possible adverse consequences related to such actions may include various charges for such items as idle capacity  disposition costs  severance costs  impairments of goodwill and possibly an immediate loss of revenues  in addition to normal or attendant risks and uncertainties 
we may be unsuccessful in any of our current or future efforts to restructure or consolidate our business 
our plans to minimize or eliminate any loss of revenues during restructuring or consolidation may not be achieved 
these activities may have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we engage in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses 
we are a company that  from time to time  seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions 
we have in the past acquired a number of businesses or companies and additional product lines and assets 
we intend to continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions 
the success of these transactions depends on our ability to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in these acquisitions 
we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and may not realize the degree or timing of the benefits that we anticipated from an acquisition 
environmental liabilities could adversely impact our financial position 
federal  state and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials  chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes or in our finished goods 
these environmental regulations have required us to expend a portion of our resources and capital on relevant compliance programs 
under these laws and regulations  we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our current or former properties are contaminated or if we send waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated  even if we did not cause the contamination 
we may be subject to additional common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties 
in addition  future changes in environmental laws or regulations may require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs 
any failure to comply with new or existing environmental laws or regulations could subject us to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in the conduct of our manufacturing operations  we have handled and do handle materials that are considered hazardous  toxic or volatile under federal  state and local laws 
the risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in addition  we operate or own facilities located on or near real property that was formerly owned and operated by others 
certain of these properties were used in ways that involved hazardous materials 
contaminants may migrate from  within or through these properties 
these releases or migrations may give rise to claims 
where third parties are responsible for contamination  the third parties may not have funds  or not make funds available when needed  to pay remediation costs imposed upon us under environmental laws and regulations 
the company is responsible for the maintenance of discontinued coal mining operations in germany 
the risk of environmental remediation exists and the company is in the process of remediating the mines considered to be the most at risk 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the automotive  consumer electronics and communications industries  and we are susceptible to trends and factors affecting those industries as well as the success of our customers products 
net sales to the automotive  consumer electronics and communications industries represent a substantial portion of our revenues 
factors negatively affecting these industries and the demand for products also negatively affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
any adverse occurrence  including industry slowdown  recession  political instability  costly or constraining regulations  armed hostilities  terrorism  excessive inflation  prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers production schedules or labor disturbances  that results in significant decline in the volume of sales in these industries  or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
for example  the automotive industry as well as the consumer electronics market is highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions  consumer preferences and interest rates 
in addition  the global automotive and electronic industries have overall manufacturing capacity far exceeding demand 
to the extent that demand for certain of our customers products declines  the demand for our products may decline 
reduced demand relating to general economic conditions  consumer preferences  interest rates or industry over capacity may have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the inability to maintain access to capital markets may adversely affect our business and financial results 
our ability to invest in our businesses  make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations may require access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short term borrowings 
if we are unable to access the capital markets or bank credit facilities  we could experience a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fixed costs may reduce operating results if our sales fall below expectations 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations for future sales 
many of our expenses  particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead  are relatively fixed 
we might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales 
accordingly  shortfalls in sales could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
the volatility of our stock price could affect the value of an investment in our stock and our future financial position 
the market price of our stock has fluctuated widely 
between january  and december   the closing sale price of our common stock ranged between a low of and a high of  experiencing greater volatility over that time than the broader markets 
the volatility of our stock price may be related to any number of factors  such as general economic conditions  industry conditions  analysts expectations concerning our results of operations  or the volatility of our revenues as discussed above under our revenues may vary significantly from period to period 
the historic market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices 
we may not be able to sustain or increase the value of our common stock 
declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to retain personnel with stock incentives  to acquire businesses or assets in exchange for stock and or to conduct future financing activities with or involving our common stock 
customer demands and new regulations related to conflict free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act requires disclosure of use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and efforts to prevent the use of such minerals 
in the semiconductor industry  these minerals are most commonly found in metals 
as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free metals  we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices 
also  we may face challenges with our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free

recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance that provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the new guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
the new guidance will be effective for the company as of january  and will be applied prospectively 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the guidance does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  because this guidance impacts presentation only  it will have no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
under the revised guidance  entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit ie  step of the goodwill impairment test 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount  the two step impairment test would be required 
the guidance does not change how goodwill is calculated or assigned to reporting units  nor does it revise the requirement to test goodwill annually for impairment 
in addition  the guidance does not amend the requirement to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events or circumstances warrant  however  it does revise the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  however the company did not adopt this guidance early 
the company is evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance but currently believes there will be no material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
goodwill testing was completed in october using the previous methodology  as permitted 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain of the accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate estimates and assumptions for calculating amounts to record in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions  impacting the reported results of operations and financial position 
significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
certain accounting policies  however  are considered to be critical in that they are most important to the depiction of the company s financial condition and results of operations and their application requires management s subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results  as they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of its board of directors 
net sales revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped fob origin to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale  the risk of loss has been transferred  collectability is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable 
at the end of each period  for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer  the company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer 
the company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third party distributors 
revenue and billing the company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements 
contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors  costs and competition 
pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment premium or discount from the company s published price lists 
the customer is invoiced when the company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement 
returns and credits some of the terms of the company s sales agreements and normal business conditions provide customers distributors the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced 
this practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program 
this program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions 
under certain circumstances usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity  a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer 
if the company approves such a reduction  the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price 
the company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue 
the company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with previous authorization from littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit 
the company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity 
sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns 
the company properly meets all of the criteria for recognizing revenue when the right of return exists 
specifically  the company meets those requirements because the company s selling price is fixed or determinable at the date of the sale 
the company has policies and procedures to accept only credit worthy customers with the ability to pay the company 
the company s customers are obligated to pay the company under the contract and the obligation is not contingent on the resale of the product 
all ship and debit and returns to stock require specific circumstances and authorization 
the risk ownership transfers to the company s customers upon shipment and is not changed in the event of theft  physical destruction or damage of the product 
the company bills at the ship date and establishes a reserve to reduce revenue from the in transit time until the product is delivered for fob destination sales 
the company s customers acquiring the product for resale have economic substance apart from that provided by littelfuse 
all distributors are independent of the company 
the company does not have any obligations for future performance to bring about resale of the product by its customers 
the company can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns 
volume rebates the company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets 
if customers achieve their sales targets  they are entitled to rebates 
the company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
the company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and  when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible 
the company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  macroeconomic considerations and past experience 
historically  the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventory the company performs regular detailed assessments of inventory  which include a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  shelf life and quality issues 
based on the analysis  the company records adjustments to inventory for excess quantities  obsolescence or impairment when appropriate to reflect inventory at net realizable value 
historically  inventory reserves have been adequate to reflect inventory at net realizable values 
during and  the company was required to step up the value of inventory acquired in business combinations to its selling prices less the cost to sell under business combination accounting 
this was aproximately million in for cole hersee and million in for selco a s 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or at an interim date if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired 
the company has seven reporting units for goodwill testing purposes 
management determines the fair value of each of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow model which includes forecasted five year income statement and working capital projections  a market based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years to estimate market value 
in addition  the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization as of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole 
as of the most recent annual test conducted on october   the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore  no potential goodwill impairment existed 
specifically  the company noted that its headroom  defined as the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital  was       and for its electronics non silicon  electronics silicon  automotive excluding cole hersee  cole hersee  relay  custom products  and fuse reporting units  respectively  at october  certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of for all reporting units except for cole hersee and a discount rate of for cole hersee 
a long term growth rate of was used for all seven reporting units 
in addition  the company performed a sensitivity test at october  that showed either a basis point increase in its discount rate or a basis point decrease in the long term growth rate for each reporting unit would not have changed the company s conclusion that no potential goodwill impairment existed at october  the company will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis  if certain conditions exist 
factors the company considers important  which could result in changes to its estimates  include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples 
due to the diverse end user base and non discretionary product demand  the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results 
long lived assets the company evaluates long lived asset groups on an ongoing basis 
long lived asset groups are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the related asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if it is determined to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company s estimates of future cash flows from such assets could be impacted if it underperforms relative to historical or projected future operating results 
the company recorded asset impairment charges of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended  and respectively 
further information regarding asset impairments is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
environmental liabilities environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of the probability of potential future environmental exposure 
expenses related to on going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred 
if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims  it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
pension and supplemental executive retirement plan littelfuse has a number of company sponsored defined benefit plans primarily in north america  europe and the asia pacific region 
the company recognizes the full unfunded status of these plans on the balance sheet 
actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company 
certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations 
these assumptions include the discount rate  salary scales and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract
