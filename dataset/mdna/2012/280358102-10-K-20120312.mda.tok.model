headquartered in wakefield  massachusetts  as of december   our company employed approximately consulting professionals excluding contractors and total professionals excluding contractors 
factors influencing our results of operations revenue 
the company derives its service revenue from time and materials based contracts  fixed price contracts and retainer based arrangements 
time and materials based contracts represented of service revenue for the year ended december  revenue under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are rendered and performed at contractually agreed upon rates 
fixed price contracts represented of service revenue for the year ended december  revenue pursuant to fixed price contracts is recognized under the proportional performance method of accounting

provisions for estimated profits or losses on incomplete projects are made on a contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such profits or losses are determined 
the company did not recognize any loss contracts during the years ended december   and  respectively 
on many projects  we are reimbursed for out of pocket expenses such as airfare  lodging and meals 
these reimbursements are included as a component of revenue and cost of revenue 
the aggregate amount of reimbursed expenses will fluctuate depending on the location of our customers  the total number of our projects that require travel and whether our arrangements with our customer provide for the reimbursement of travel and other project related expenses 
our quarterly and annual operating results were significantly impacted by a dramatic slowdown in the it consulting services business environment 
however  we proactively responded to these challenges through a systematic reorientation of the company s strategic direction  service offerings and resources  which we believe has positioned the company to respond to and capitalize upon the changing needs of the marketplace 
each of the strategic initiatives we have implemented the development of new service offerings  the cross disciplinary training of our billable consultant resources and focusing our sales efforts on new technologies was undertaken with the specific goal of transforming the company s it service offerings towards a product based consulting model 
in connection with our migration to more of a product based consulting model  software revenue will continue to be a significant portion of our revenues 
software revenue  driven by resales of microsoft dynamics

software and maintenance revenue are recognized upon delivery  except in the infrequent situation where the company provides maintenance services  in which case the related maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance period while the software revenue is recognized upon delivery 
software revenue is expected to fluctuate between quarters  dependent on our customers demand for such third party off the shelf software 
fluctuations in software revenue may have an impact upon our periodic operating performance  including gross margin 
operating expenses 
the largest portion of our operating expenses consists of cash and non cash compensation and benefits associated with our project consulting personnel and related expenses 
non cash compensation includes stock compensation expense arising from restricted stock and option grants to employees 
project personnel expenses also consist of payroll costs and related benefits associated with our professional staff 
other related expenses include travel  subcontracting costs  third party vendor payments and non billable expenses associated with the delivery of services to our customers 
we consider the relationship between project personnel expenses and revenue to be an important measure of our operating performance 
the relationship between project personnel expenses and revenue is driven largely by the chargeability of our consultant base  the prices we charge our customers and the non billable costs associated with securing new customer engagements and developing new service offerings 
the remainder of our recurring operating expense consists of expenses associated with the development of our business and the support of our customer serving professionals  such as professional development and recruiting  marketing and sales  and management and administrative support 
professional development and recruiting expenses consist primarily of recruiting and training content development and delivery costs 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with the development and maintenance of our marketing materials and programs 
management and administrative support expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with operations including finance  information systems  human resources  facilities including the rent of office space and other administrative support for project personnel 
we regularly review our fees for services  professional compensation and overhead costs to ensure that our services and compensation are competitive within the industry  and that our overhead costs are balanced with our revenue levels 
in addition  we monitor the progress of customer projects with customer senior management 
we manage the activities of our professionals by closely monitoring engagement schedules and staffing requirements 
however  a rapid decline in the demand for the professional services that we provide could result in lower utilization of our professionals than we planned 
in addition  because most of our customer engagements are terminable by our customers without penalty  an unanticipated termination of a customer project could require us to maintain underutilized employees 
while professional staff levels must be adjusted to reflect active engagements  we must also maintain a sufficient number of consulting professionals to oversee existing customer engagements and to participate in sales activities to secure new customer assignments 
adjustments to fair value of contingent consideration 
during the years ended december  and  we reported changes in the estimated fair value of certain acquisition related  contingent consideration liabilities 
we remeasure the estimated carrying value of contingent consideration each quarter  with any changes income or expense in the estimated fair value recorded as an operating expense 
changes in the carrying value of contingent consideration liabilities may fluctuate significantly in future periods depending on changes in estimates  including probabilities associated with achieving the milestones and the period in which we estimate these milestones will be achieved 
in  the company recorded an expense  related to the change in fair value of the contingent earnout accrual  of million within selling  general and administrative expense on the consolidated statement of operations as a result of the performance of fullscope s process contracts during the company settled the liability in the amount of million during the fourth quarter of and no further contingent earnout may be earned by the former fullscope stockholders 

table of contents in may  meridian completed its first twelve month earnout period  during which the required performance measurements were not achieved 
the former meridian stockholders did not receive any additional contingent consideration related to the first earnout period 
the company  as of december   has accrued thousand in potential future contingent earnout consideration payable to the former meridian stockholders related to the completion of the second and third twelve month earnout periods 
as of december   the maximum amount of contingent earnout consideration that the former stockholders of meridian can earn during the final two earnout periods is capped at million 
non routine professional services related expenses 
during the years ended december  and  we incurred certain non routine professional service related expenses associated with our identification of embezzlement activities at fullscope  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries the fullscope embezzlement issue 
we incurred the majority of our embezzlement related expenses during fiscal in connection with our identification and investigation of the embezzlement activity 
while embezzlement related expenses decreased in  we anticipate that we may continue to incur additional expenses associated with the fullscope embezzlement issue as we intend to aggressively pursue recovery through all possible avenues  including a claim against the escrow account established in connection with the fullscope acquisition and reimbursement under insurance policies 
we anticipate that we will be able to recover some  if not all  of the receivable amounts embezzled during  the professional service expenses we have incurred to date  or will incur in the future  addressing this situation  and any amounts paid to settle any of the identified sales and use tax liability amounts 
amounts recovered  if any  will be recorded during the period in which settlement is determined to be certain 
acquisition related costs 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately thousand in professional service related expenses directly associated with our acquisitions of fullscope  inc the fullscope acquisition and meridian consulting international the meridian acquisition 
our stated goal is to continue to pursue strategic growth initiatives focused upon making our company a leading provider of specialty information technology consulting services 
our strategic growth initiatives may be based upon the expansion of our existing core service offerings or through the acquisition of new and or complementary service or product based offerings 
pursuing either of these growth avenues may cause the company to incur non routine operating expenses in connection with our investment in a particular growth initiative 
increase to deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we have net deferred tax assets that have arisen primarily as a result of timing differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
our ability to realize a deferred tax asset is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income within the applicable carryforward period and subject to any applicable limitations 
we assess  on a routine periodic basis  the estimated future realizability of the gross carrying value of our deferred tax assets on a more likely than not basis 
our periodic assessments take into consideration both positive evidence future profitability projections for example and negative evidence recent and historical financial performance for example as it relates to evaluating the future recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
during the third quarter of  the company performed a review of the more than likely recovery of the net carrying value of its deferred tax assets in connection with its historical financial performance and to a lesser extent  forecasts and projections 
as a result of the operating loss in the quarter ended september   our assessment of our adjusted and cumulative loss positions and uncertainty as to the timing of profitability in future periods  we determined that it was not more likely than not that the company would be able to realize future economic benefit from its net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we increased our deferred tax valuation allowance by million  providing for a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of september  the impairment charge is more fully described in
