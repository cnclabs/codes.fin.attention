overview we develop and distribute educational entertainment for children 
our product portfolio consists of multimedia learning platforms and related content and learning toys 
we have developed a number of learning platforms  including the leappad  the leapster family of multimedia learning platforms and the tag and tag junior reading systems  which support a broad library of content titles 
we have created hundreds of interactive content titles for our platforms  covering subjects such as phonics  reading  writing and math 
in addition  we have a broad line of stand alone learning toys that do not require the separate purchase of content 
our products are available in four languages including queen s english and are sold globally through retailers  distributors and directly to consumers via our leapfrog 
com online store and our app center 
we generate revenue from selling our multimedia learning platforms and a range of learning toys 
we also generate revenue from the sale of a wide range of cartridge based and digitally downloadable content and books for our platforms that we develop based on licensed characters or our leapfrog owned characters 
our multimedia platforms and certain other products connect to our proprietary online leapfrog learning path  which provides parents personalized feedback on their child s learning progress and offers product recommendations to enhance their child s learning experience 
parents are able to see the learning and gain personalized insight into their child s learning progress 
our app center  launched in  gives our consumers access to a variety of downloadable content for our multimedia platforms 
we also began distributing third party video content for use on our multimedia platforms through the app center near the end of  including popular titles such as dora the explorer  spongebob squarepants and thomas the tank engine 
although our multimedia platform products compete in the electronic learning aids category in the us and in selected international markets  we increasingly compete in a broader arena with a variety of electronic products including tablet computers  ebook readers and mobile devices 
our multimedia platforms  such as our leappad learning tablet and leapster explorer platform  compete against handheld gaming platforms from sony and nintendo and against mobile devices such as apple s iphone  itouch and ipad and android based tablets 
our learning toys compete in the preschool toy category of the toy industry in the us and selected international markets  in which competition is significant 
we invest in r d of existing and new lines of business that we believe will contribute to our long term growth and profitability 
we continue to invest in developing new multimedia platforms  related content and online services based on the latest relevant technologies and consumer trends 
for example  in we introduced leappad  a kid tough  personalized learning tablet for children with a built in camera and video recorder 
leappad includes art  story  and photo studio applications and two gigabytes of memory on board and can be used with both cartridges and digital content from our app center  which was also launched in we believe delivering high value  innovative  educational experiences that are fun for children and engage parents is the key to our future growth 
our business is highly seasonal with a significant portion of our revenue occurring in the second half of the year 
given relatively low sales volumes in the first half of the year and the relatively fixed nature of many of our operating expenses  which occur fairly evenly throughout the year  our results of operations have historically been stronger in our third and fourth quarters relative to our first and second quarters 
sales in the fourth quarter have historically been higher than all other quarters 
in  and  fourth quarter net sales made up  and of total net sales for the years  respectively 
conversely  our cash flow from operations tends to be highest in the first quarter of the year when we collect the majority of our accounts receivable related to sales made in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
cash flow from operations generally tends to be lowest in our third quarter  as accounts receivables collections taper off and we build our inventory levels in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season 
the reduction in cash flow in the third quarter generally means that our available cash is at its lowest point for the year in the first month of the fourth quarter 
in  we achieved significant net sales growth and returned to profitability for the first time in several years due to the successful launch of several new products 
however  weaker than expected consumer demand of our products in the fourth quarter of resulted in higher end of the year retail inventory levels  which contributed to a decrease in net sales in the first half of in the second half of the year  the successful launch of the leappad learning tablet contributed significantly to overall year over year growth in net sales in however  despite the modest economic recovery  we still face significant risk associated with consumer spending  especially in light of sustained low levels of consumer confidence 
total operating expenses decreased in over  and were down nearly points as a percentage of net sales 
this is the lowest level of annual spend we have achieved since in and  we benefitted from reduced selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses as a result of actions taken in and during the fourth quarter of  we terminated several employees in the us and terminated the lease of a portion of our headquarter facilities in emeryville  california prior to the end of the contracted term 
as a result  we benefited from a further decline in sg a expenses in  offset in part by an increase in compensation expenses due to exceeding the financial performance targets included in our employee bonus programs 
in addition  our advertising expense was well managed  down year over year given the effectiveness of our social media and direct marketing efforts 
we significantly expanded our profitability in with income from operations up threefold and net income up fourfold over the prior year with earnings per share of  an improvement of compared to this is the highest income from operations  net income and earnings per share that we have reported since our ending cash and equivalents balance was million which represents an increase of million compared to a year ago and is the largest year over year increase in our cash balance since and importantly  operating cash flow was million for  an improvement of million 
lastly  we ended the year with both our inventory and retail inventory at more appropriate levels 
we organize  operate and assess our business in two primary operating segments us and international

outlook the year ahead will present challenges including continuing global economic volatility  key platform launches  product transitions  and increased competition in the children s tablet space 
despite these challenges  we are encouraged by the progress we made in and enter with momentum 
we believe we are well positioned to achieve higher levels of profitability in we expect earnings improvement to be driven by net sales growth  modest margin expansion  and disciplined growth and expense management 
we believe net sales growth will be much stronger in the seasonally less significant first half of compared to the second half of the year 
the first half of should benefit from continued leappad momentum and healthier retail inventory levels entering the year  while the second half growth may moderate compared to the second half of  given the comparison to the year which featured the successful leappad launch  managing through key platform transitions  and uncertainty around the global economy 
our expectations for results are subject to many uncertainties  including the timing and strength of any economic recovery and many other factors described in the risk factors set forth in part i risk factors in item a of this form k  there can be no assurance that consumer demand for our products will improve in compared to operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses consist primarily of salaries and related employee benefits  including stock based compensation expense and other headcount related expenses associated with executive management  finance  information technology  supply chain  facilities  human resources  other administrative headcount  legal and other professional fees  indirect selling expenses  systems costs  rent  office equipment and supplies

the us dollar strengthened significantly against several of our foreign currencies late in the third quarter of resulting in a million realized foreign currency translation loss and a million unrealized foreign currency translation loss for the third quarter of we generally enter into short term foreign exchange forward contracts  typically based on day forward spot rates  to minimize certain foreign exposures 
however  during the third quarter of  an operational error caused us to enter into forward hedging contracts that differed from what we had intended 
as a result of this error  we recorded a million realized loss on foreign exchange forward contracts in our us segment for the third quarter of we subsequently made improvements to our foreign currency hedging program to provide greater assurance of accurate execution of our hedging determinations which performed as expected during the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to fiscal year interest income decreased during as compared to reflecting a reduction in the average balance of interest bearing investments as well as lower interest rates in as compared to the improvement in the other  net category was primarily due to the stabilization of the fair values of our investment in auction rate securities ars  we recorded a gain on sale of million in as compared to a net impairment charge of million in this improvement was offset by an increase in the amortization of fees related to the amended asset based revolving credit facility entered into on august  income taxes our provision for benefit from income taxes and effective tax rates were as follows dollars in millions provision for benefit from income taxes income loss before income taxes effective tax rate our tax rate is affected by recurring items  such as tax expense relative to the amount of income earned in our foreign jurisdictions

gross margin for decreased percentage points as compared to the decrease was primarily driven by higher shipping costs and an increased use of discounts  partially offset by higher sales relative to fixed warehousing expense 
in addition  the gross margin in benefited from an inventory related adjustment resulting in a higher than usual gross margin 
income from operations for increased as compared to the increase was primarily driven by an increase in net sales  partially offset by lower gross margin for as compared to liquidity and capital resources financial condition cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash balance was due to an increase in net sales as well as timelier cash collection from our customers 
in line with our investment policy  all cash equivalents were invested in high grade money market funds at december  as of december   we held million  stated at fair value  in long term investments in ars 
due to the illiquidity of these investments  we have not included and do not intend  for the foreseeable future  to include them as potential sources of liquidity in our future cash flow projections 
thus  we do not anticipate that future declines in value  if any  will have an adverse impact on our future ability to support operations and meet our obligations as they come due 
we have an asset backed revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  which is discussed in more detail below  with a potential borrowing availability of million 
there were no borrowings outstanding on this line of credit at december  we do not expect our accumulated deficit of million at december  to be indicative of our future ability to generate cash flow  given our anticipated cash flows from operations and the availability of our revolving credit facility 
future capital expenditures are primarily planned for new product development and purchases related to the upgrading of our information technology capabilities 
we expect that capital expenditures in  including those for capitalized content and website development costs  will be funded with cash flows generated by operations 
capital expenditures were million for  million for including a million purchase of intangible assets  and million for  which included a million purchase of intangible assets 
we believe that cash on hand  cash flow from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will provide adequate funds for our foreseeable working capital needs and planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
our ability to fund our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures  as well as our ability to comply with all of the financial covenants of our revolving credit facility  depend on our future operating performance and cash flows  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions

increase in net income and improved accounts receivable collection efforts also contributed to the increase in cash flow provided by operations for net cash used in investing activities for decreased million compared to  primarily due to a million purchase of intangible assets in  partially offset by an increase in hardware and software purchases in as well as the cash generated from sales of investments in  of which there were zero in net cash provided by financing activities for increased million as compared to primarily due to an increase in employee option exercises  partially offset by higher payroll taxes related to an increase in employee restricted stock units released in the as compared to fiscal year compared to fiscal year net cash used in operating activities for increased million  as compared to  primarily due to a significantly higher inventory level purchased to support expected sales demand  and a decrease in associated accounts payable due to timelier payments  offset partially by increased cash collected from our accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities increased million  or  for as compared to  primarily due to the purchase of million of intangible assets related to the technology used in our tag reading system 
the remaining increase is primarily related to various computer hardware and software upgrades and maintenance  as well as new software purchases to further automate processes and better support operations 
net cash provided by financing activities improved million for as compared to  primarily due to an increase in employee stock option exercises in response to a higher average company stock price during as compared to seasonal patterns of cash provided by used in operations the table below shows our seasonal patterns of cash flow provided by used in operations by quarter for the fiscal years ended december   and dollars in millions st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter total  net for fiscal year with the exception of  our cash flow from operations is generally highest in the first quarter of each year when we collect a majority of our accounts receivable booked in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
in  quarterly cash flows did not conform to this general pattern as a result of our tightened cash management practices in response to the global economic crisis  leading to higher accounts payable balances 
thus  cash flow provided by operations was higher in the fourth quarter of than in the first quarter of cash flow used in operations tends to be highest in our third quarter  as collections from prior accounts receivables taper off and we invest heavily in inventory in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season 
historically  cash flow generally turns positive again in the fourth quarter as we begin to collect on the accounts receivables associated with the holiday season 
based on the shift in ordering patterns by retailers beginning in  which resulted in orders being placed significantly later in the year  cash flows from operations in the fourth quarter of were significantly lower than has historically been the case in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
as a result  cash flows from operations in the first quarter of were higher than in previous years 
these seasonal patterns may vary depending upon general economic conditions and other factors 
line of credit and borrowing availability on august   we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement for a million asset based revolving credit facility with bank of america  na and certain other financial institutions 
we have granted a security interest in substantially all of our assets to the lenders as security for our obligations under the revolving credit facility 
provided there is no default under the revolving credit facility  we may elect  without the consent of any of the lenders  to increase the size of the revolving credit facility up to an aggregate of million 
the borrowing availability varies according to the levels of our accounts receivable and cash and investment securities deposited in secured accounts with the lenders 
subject to the level of this borrowing base  we may make and repay borrowings from time to time until the maturity of the facility 
the interest rate is  at our election  bank of america  na s prime rate or base rate or a libor rate defined in the loan agreement  plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the applicable margin for a loan depends on the average daily availability for the most recent fiscal quarter and the type of loan 
borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility was million as of december  the revolving credit facility contains customary events of default  including for payment failures  failure to comply with covenants  failure to satisfy other obligations under the revolving credit facility or related documents  defaults in respect of other indebtedness  bankruptcy  insolvency and inability to pay debts when due  change in control provisions  and the invalidity of guaranty or security agreements 
if any event of default occurs  the lenders may terminate their respective commitments  declare immediately due all borrowings under the revolving credit facility and foreclose on the collateral 
a cross default provision applies if a default occurs on other indebtedness in excess of million and the applicable grace period in respect of the indebtedness has expired  such that the lender of  or trustee for  the defaulted indebtedness has the right to accelerate 
we are also required to maintain a ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  to fixed charges  as defined in the revolving credit facility  of at least to when the covenant is required to be tested 
the ratio is measured only if certain borrowing availability thresholds are not met 
on january   we entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility that  among other things i extends the maturity date to august   ii reduces  starting january   the applicable interest rate margins to a range of to above the applicable base rate for base rate loans  as compared to above the applicable base rate in the original agreement  and to above the applicable libor rate for libor rate loans  as compared to above the applicable libor rate in the original agreement  in each case depending on our borrowing availability  and iii reduces  starting january   the unused line fee to per year if utilization of the line is greater than or equal to  and to per year if utilization of the line is less than  as compared to per year in the original agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  we drew down million on the revolving credit facility 
this borrowing was a libor rate loan  with an initial interest rate per annum of  provided that  in accordance with the loan agreement  such rate may adjust on a monthly basis 
we repaid the full amount during the same quarter with cash provided by operations and had no borrowings outstanding under this agreement at december  contractual obligations and commitments we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
we conduct our corporate operations from leased facilities under operating leases 
generally  these have initial lease periods of three to twelve years and contain provisions for renewal options of five years at market rates 
we account for rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
in addition  we are obligated to pay certain minimum royalties in connection with license agreements to which it is a party 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations at december  payments due in less than more than total year years years years dollars in millions operating leases royalty guarantees total in addition  at december   we had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under our revolving credit facility with at december   and had million of potential availability on the line 
in addition  we had commitments to purchase inventory under normal supply arrangements totaling approximately million at december  critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
we believe that certain accounting policies  which we refer to as critical accounting policies  are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the use of significant estimates and the application of significant judgment by our management 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  particularly those related to our critical accounting policies 
the following discussion highlights those policies and the underlying estimates and assumptions  which we consider critical to an understanding of the financial information in this report 
revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and other accounts receivables and revenue reserves we derived the majority of our revenue from sales of our technology based learning products and related proprietary content 
revenue is recognized when products are shipped and title passes to the customer  provided that there is evidence of a commercial arrangement  delivery has occurred  there is a fixed or determinable fee and collection is reasonably assured 
we sell app center cards to retailers and directly to end customers  which are redeemable on our app center for content downloads 
we record proceeds from the initial sale of the card to deferred revenue which is relieved when the right to download content is granted to the customer upon redemption of the card 
for content purchased by the customer with a personal credit card directly through our app center  we recognize revenue when the right to download content is granted 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs are recognized as revenue 
costs incurred to ship merchandise from warehouse facilities are recorded in cost of sales 
net sales represent gross sales less estimated sales returns  allowances for defective products  promotional markdowns  charge backs and price changes  and cooperative promotional arrangements 
correspondingly  these allowances are recorded as reductions of gross accounts receivable 
we reduce our gross accounts receivable balance by an allowance for amounts we believe may become uncollectible 
this allowance is an estimate based primarily on management s evaluation of the customer s financial condition in the context of current economic conditions  past collection history and aging of the accounts receivable balances 
determining such allowance requires judgment  the result of which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported in accounts receivable 
if changes in the economic climate or in the financial condition of any of our customers impair or improve their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowances may be required 
we also provide estimated allowances against revenue and accounts receivable for sales returns  defective products  promotional markdowns  charge backs and price changes  and cooperative promotional arrangements in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the allowances are estimated utilizing historical information  maximum known exposures and other available information including current retailer inventory levels  sell through of its retailers and distributors  current trends in retail for its products  changes in customer demand for its products and other related factors 
accounts receivable are reported on the balance sheet net of all provided allowances  which included the allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value  on a first in  first out basis 
we record inventory costs on the balance sheet based on third party contract manufacturer invoices  which include the contract manufacturers costs for materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to our products 
inventory valuation primarily requires estimation of slow moving  obsolete or excess products 
our estimate of the write downs for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories is based on management s review of on hand inventories compared to their product demand forecast  anticipated product selling prices  the expected product lifecycle  and products planned for discontinuation 
if actual future demand for our products and anticipated product selling prices were less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write downs would be required resulting in a negative impact on our gross margin 
we monitor the estimates of inventory write downs on a quarterly basis 
when considered necessary  we make additional adjustments to reduce inventory to its net realizable value  with corresponding increases to cost of sales 
inventories included write downs for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories of million and million at december  and  respectively 
capitalization of product costs we capitalize certain external costs related to the development of content for our learning products  including design  artwork  animation  layout  editing  voice  audio and apps included in the learning products 
such costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of the product is established and costs are determined to be recoverable 
amortization of these costs begins when the products are initially released for sale and continues over a two year life using the straight line method  and is included in cost of sales 
we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized amounts periodically and recognize write downs in the statements of operations as needed 
capitalized content costs that are cancelled  abandoned or otherwise deemed impaired are charged to cost of sales in the period of cancellation 
write downs of capitalized costs related to platforms being discontinued or non performing titles resulted in an increase in cost of sales in the us segment of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we also capitalize external website development costs website costs  which primarily include third party costs related to developing applications that are integral components of certain products we market  costs incurred to develop or acquire and customize code for web applications  costs to develop html web pages or develop templates  and costs to create initial graphics for the website that included the design or layout of each page 
website costs are amortized on a straight line basis over two years 
we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized website costs periodically and if an impairment loss is considered to have occurred during the period  we accelerate the amortization and record it in depreciation and amortization in the statement of operations in the same period 
our evaluations of capitalized content development costs and website costs require us to make complex and subjective judgments  using currently available data as well as projections about the potential impact of possible future events and conditions  which judgments and projections are inherently uncertain 
if future events and conditions do not meet expectations  we make additional adjustments to reduce the expected realizable value of the assets  with corresponding increases to cost of sales 
capitalized content development costs and website costs are both included in capitalized product costs on the balance sheet  net of accumulated amortization 
goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment at least annually  and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that warrant a review 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors or operating performance indicators 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
under this guidance  if an entity determines  after assessing such qualitative factors  that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
we early adopted this guidance for our december  annual goodwill impairment test 
our qualitative assessment includes consideration of relevant events and circumstances that may impact the carrying amount of the reporting unit to which our goodwill is allocated 
the identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting unit s fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgment and assumptions 
relevant events and circumstances identified include  but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  leapfrog specific events  share price trends 
additional judgment is required to determine relative importance and impact of each factor 
if the qualitative assessment concludes that it is probable that there is impairment  then a quantitative assessment must be performed 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment  including identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  and projections of future net cash flows  which projections are inherently uncertain 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow methodology 
the market approach requires considerable judgment in selecting comparable companies and estimating the multiples of revenue implied by their market values 
the discounted cash flow methodology requires management to exercise judgment in selecting an appropriate discount rate and to make numerous assumptions in order to develop future business and financial forecasts and the related estimates of future net cash flows 
future net cash flows depend primarily on future sales of our products  which are inherently difficult to predict 
this is especially true when a significant portion of our future net sales is expected to be generated by both mature products as well as products introduced in and planned to be introduced in after analyzing our goodwill at december  and  we concluded no impairment charge was required in either period 
at december  and  we had million and million of goodwill and other intangible assets  respectively 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
we calculate our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions 
the determination of our income tax assets  liabilities and expense requires us to make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax benefits  tax credits and deductions 
significant changes in these estimates or variations in the actual outcome of expected future tax consequences may result in material increases or decreases in the tax provision or benefit in subsequent periods 
we provide valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
determination of whether or not a valuation allowance is warranted requires consideration of all available positive and negative evidence  including prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
our financial statements also include accruals for the estimated amounts of probable future assessments that may result from the examination of federal  state or international tax returns 
our tax accruals  tax provision  deferred tax assets or income tax liabilities may be adjusted if there are changes in circumstances  such as changes in tax law  tax audits or other factors  which may cause management to revise its estimates 
the amounts ultimately paid on any future assessments may differ from the amounts accrued and may result in an increase or reduction to the effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
such adjustments could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award generally four years using the straight line method 
determining the fair value of stock based compensation awards at grant date requires significant judgment and estimates regarding valuation variables such as volatility  expected forfeiture rates and the expected term of the awards 
stock based compensation expense may be significantly affected by changes in our stock price  our actual forfeiture rates and the extent of future grants of equity awards 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
recently adopted accounting guidance in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
we early adopted this guidance for the year ended december  and applied retrospectively as required to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income in two separate consecutive statements 
the adoption of this guidance did not result in any material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic 
this guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
under this guidance  if an entity determines  after assessing such qualitative factors  that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
we early adopted this guidance for our december  annual goodwill impairment test  which did not result in any material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting guidance not yet adopted in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this guidance represents the converged guidance of the fasb and the international accounting standards board on fair value measurement  which resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements  including a consistent meaning of the term fair value 
for public entities  this guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   and is to be applied prospectively 
we do not anticipate material impact to our consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this guidance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the us and market our products primarily in north america and  to a lesser extent  in europe and the rest of the world 
we are billed by and pay our third party manufacturers in us dollars usd 
sales to our international customers are transacted primarily in the country s local currency 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
we manage our foreign currency transaction exposure by entering into short term forward contracts 
the purpose of this hedging program is to minimize the foreign currency exchange gain or loss reported in our financial statements  but the program  when properly executed  may not always eliminate our exposure to movements of currency exchange rates 
the results of our hedging program for the fiscal years ended december   and are summarized in the table below years ended december  dollars in thousands gains losses on foreign exchange forward contracts  gains losses on underlying transactions denomincated in foreign currency  net gains losses  amount includes a million realized loss on foreign exchange forward hedging contracts in our us segment due to an operational error 
the united states dollar strengthened significantly against several of our foreign currencies late in the third quarter of resulting in a million realized foreign currency translation loss and a million unrealized foreign currency translation loss for the three month period ended september  in addition  we enter into short term foreign exchange forward contracts  typically based on day forward spot rates to minimize certain foreign exposures 
during the third quarter of  an operational error caused us to enter into forward hedging contracts that differed from what we had intended 
as a result of this error  we recorded a million realized loss on foreign exchange forward contracts in our u 
s 
segment for the three month period ended september  we subsequently made improvements to our foreign currency hedging program to provide greater assurance of accurate execution of our hedging determinations 
our foreign exchange forward contracts generally have original maturities of one month or less 
a summary of all foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of december  and is as follows average forward exchange rate notional amount in local currency fair value of instruments in usd average forward exchange rate notional amount in local currency fair value of instruments in usd currencies british pound gbp usd  euro euro usd   canadian dollar usd cad  mexican peso usd mxp  total fair value of instruments in usd in thousands of local currency in thousands of usd cash equivalents and short term and long term investments are presented at fair value on our balance sheet 
we invest our excess cash in accordance with our investment policy 
any adverse changes in interest rates or securities prices may decrease the value of our investments and operating results 
as of december   our excess cash was invested only in money market funds 
at december   we did not hold any cash equivalents 
we experience interest rate risk and impairment risk only on our long term investment in ars as we have no long term borrowings 
we evaluate this investment on a quarterly basis and will continue to recognize impairment losses in the statements of operations  if and when they occur
