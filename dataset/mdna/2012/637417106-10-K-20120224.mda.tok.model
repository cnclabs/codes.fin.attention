governmental regulations affecting properties property environmental considerations 
subject to a determination of the level of risk and potential cost of remediation  nnn may acquire a property where some level of contamination may exist 
investments in real property create a potential for substantial environmental liability for the owner of such property from the presence or discharge of hazardous materials on the property or the improper disposal of hazardous materials emanating from the property  regardless of fault

item a 
risk factors carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form k  including the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
if any of the events or developments described below were actually to occur  nnn s business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
current financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on nnn  its tenants  and commercial real estate in general 
current financial and economic conditions continue to be challenging and volatile and any worsening of such conditions  including any disruption in the capital markets  could adversely affect nnn s business and results of operations and the financial condition of nnn s tenants  developers  borrowers  lenders or the institutions that hold nnn s cash balances and short term investments  which may expose nnn to increased risks of default by these parties 
there can be no assurance that actions of the united states government  federal reserve or other government and regulatory bodies intended to stabilize the economy or financial markets will achieve their intended effect 
additionally  some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions  capital providers  retailers  consumers or nnn s financial condition  results of operations or the trading price of nnn s shares 

table of contents potential consequences of the current financial and economic conditions include the financial condition of nnn s tenants may be adversely affected  which may result in tenant defaults under the leases due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failures or for other reasons  the ability to borrow on terms and conditions that nnn finds acceptable may be limited or unavailable  which could reduce nnn s ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt  reduce nnn s returns from acquisition and development activities  reduce nnn s ability to make cash distributions to its shareholders and increase nnn s future interest expense  the recognition of impairment charges on or reduced values of nnn s properties  which may adversely affect nnn s results of operations or limit nnn s ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices and may reduce the availability of buyer financing  the value and liquidity of nnn s short term investments and cash deposits could be reduced as a result of a deterioration of the financial condition of the institutions that hold nnn s cash deposits or the institutions or assets in which nnn has made short term investments  the dislocation of the markets for nnn s short term investments  increased volatility in market rates for such investments or other factors  and one or more lenders under the credit facility could fail and nnn may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms  or at all 
nnn may be unable to obtain debt or equity capital on favorable terms  if at all 
nnn may be unable to obtain capital on favorable terms  if at all  to further its business objectives or meet its existing obligations 
nearly all of nnn s debt  including the credit facility  is subject to balloon principal payments due at maturity 
these maturities range between and nnn s ability to make these scheduled principal payments may be adversely impacted by nnn s inability to extend or refinance the credit facility  the inability to dispose of assets at an attractive price or the inability to obtain additional debt or equity capital 
capital that may be available may be materially more expensive or available under terms that are materially more restrictive than nnn s existing capital which would have an adverse impact on nnn s business  financial condition or results of operations 
loss of revenues from tenants would reduce nnn s cash flow 
nnn s tenants encounter significant macroeconomic  governmental and competitive forces 
adverse changes in consumer spending or consumer preferences for particular goods  services or store based retailing could severely impact their ability to pay rent 
the default  financial distress  bankruptcy or liquidation of one or more of nnn s tenants could cause substantial vacancies among nnn s property portfolio 
vacancies reduce nnn s revenues  increase property expenses and could decrease the ultimate sale value of each such vacant property 
upon the expiration of a lease  the tenant may choose not to renew the lease and or nnn may not be able to re lease the vacant property at a comparable lease rate or without incurring additional expenditures in connection with such renewal or re leasing 
a significant portion of the source of nnn s property portfolio annual base rent is concentrated in specific industry classifications  tenants and in specific geographic locations 
as of december   approximately  percent of nnn s property portfolio annual base rent is generated from five retail lines of trade  including convenience stores percent and full service restaurants nine percent  percent of nnn s property portfolio annual base rent is generated from five tenants  including the pantry  inc seven percent and susser holdings corp 
six percent  and percent of nnn s property portfolio annual base rent is generated from five states  including texas percent and florida nine percent 
any financial hardship and or economic changes in these lines of trade  tenants or states could have an adverse effect on nnn s results of operations 

table of contents owning real estate and indirect interests in real estate carries inherent risks 
nnn s economic performance and the value of its real estate assets are subject to the risk that if nnn s properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet its operating expenses  including debt service  nnn s cash flow and ability to pay distributions to its shareholders will be adversely affected 
as a real estate company  nnn is susceptible to the following real estate industry risks  which are beyond its control changes in national  regional and local economic conditions and outlook  decreases in consumer spending and retail sales or adverse changes in consumer preferences for particular goods  services or store based retailing  economic downturns in the areas where nnn s properties are located  adverse changes in local real estate market conditions  such as an oversupply of space  reduction in demand for space  intense competition for tenants  or a geographic shift in the market away from nnn s properties  changes in tenant or consumer preferences that reduce the attractiveness of nnn s properties to tenants  changes in zoning  regulatory restrictions  or tax laws  and changes in interest rates or availability of financing 
all of these factors could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates  which could adversely affect nnn s results of operations 
nnn s real estate investments are illiquid 
because real estate investments are relatively illiquid  nnn s ability to adjust the portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions is limited 
certain significant expenditures generally do not change in response to economic or other conditions  including i debt service if any  ii real estate taxes  and iii operating and maintenance costs 
this combination of variable revenue and relatively fixed expenditures may result  under certain market conditions  in reduced earnings and could have an adverse effect on nnn s financial condition 
costs of complying with changes in governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect nnn s results of operations 
nnn cannot predict what other laws or regulations will be enacted in the future  how future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted  or how future laws or regulations will affect nnn s properties  including  but not limited to environmental laws and regulations 
compliance with new laws or regulations  or stricter interpretation of existing laws  may require nnn  its retail tenants  or consumers to incur significant expenditures  impose significant liability  restrict or prohibit business activities and could cause a material adverse effect on nnn s results of operation 
nnn may be subject to known or unknown environmental liabilities and hazardous materials on properties owned by nnn 
there may be known or unknown environmental liabilities associated with properties owned or acquired in the future by nnn 
certain particular uses of some properties may also have a heightened risk of environmental liability because of the hazardous materials used in performing services on those properties  such as convenience stores with underground petroleum storage tanks or auto parts and auto service businesses using petroleum products  paint and machine solvents 
some of nnn s properties may contain asbestos or asbestos containing materials  or may contain or may develop mold or other bio contaminants 
asbestos containing materials must be handled  managed and removed in accordance with applicable governmental laws  rules and regulations 
mold and other bio contaminants can produce airborne toxins  may cause a variety of health issues in individuals and must be remediated in accordance with applicable governmental laws  rules and regulations 
as part of its due diligence process  nnn generally obtains an environmental site assessment for each property it acquires 
in cases where nnn intends to acquire real estate where some level of contamination may exist  nnn generally requires the seller or tenant to i remediate the contamination in accordance with applicable laws  rules and regulations  ii indemnify nnn for environmental liabilities  and or iii agree to other arrangements deemed appropriate by nnn  including  under certain circumstances  the purchase of environmental insurance 
although sellers or tenants may be contractually responsible for remediating hazardous materials on a property and may be responsible for indemnifying nnn for any liability resulting from the use of a property and for any failure to comply with any applicable environmental laws  rules or regulations  nnn has no assurance that sellers or tenants shall be able to meet their remediation and indemnity obligations to nnn 
a tenant or seller may not have the financial ability to meet its remediation and indemnity obligations to nnn when required 
furthermore  nnn may have strict liability to governmental agencies or third parties as a result of the existence of hazardous materials on properties  whether or not nnn knew about or caused such hazardous materials to exist 

table of contents as of february  nnn has properties currently under some level of environmental remediation 
in general  the seller  a previous owner  the tenant or an adjacent land owner is responsible for the cost of the environmental remediation for each of these properties 
if nnn is responsible for hazardous materials located on its properties  nnn s liability may include investigation and remediation costs  property damage to third parties  personal injury to third parties  and governmental fines and penalties 
furthermore  the presence of hazardous materials on a property may adversely impact the property value or nnn s ability to sell the property 
significant environmental liability could impact nnn s results of operations  ability to make distributions to shareholders  and its ability to meet its debt obligations 
in order to mitigate exposure to environmental liability  nnn has an environmental insurance policy on certain of its convenience store and travel plaza properties which expires in august however  the policy is subject to exclusions and limitations and does not cover all of the properties owned by nnn  and for those properties covered under the policy  insurance may not fully compensate nnn for any environmental liability 
nnn has no assurance that the insurer on its environmental insurance policy will be able to meet its obligations under the policy 
nnn may not desire to renew the environmental insurance policy in place upon expiration or a replacement policy may not be available at a reasonable cost  if at all 
nnn may not be able to successfully execute its acquisition or development strategies 
nnn may not be able to implement its investment strategies successfully 
additionally  nnn cannot assure that its property portfolio will expand at all  or if it will expand at any specified rate or to any specified size 
in addition  investment in additional real estate assets is subject to a number of risks 
because nnn expects to invest in markets other than the ones in which its current properties are located or properties which may be leased to tenants other than those to which nnn has historically leased properties  nnn will also be subject to the risks associated with investment in new markets or with new tenants that may be relatively unfamiliar to nnn s management team 
nnn s development activities are subject to  without limitation  risks relating to the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory approvals  the cost and timely completion of construction including risks from factors beyond nnn s control  such as weather or labor conditions or material shortages  the risk of finding tenants for the properties and the ability to obtain both construction and permanent financing on favorable terms 
these risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and  under certain circumstances  could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken or provide a tenant the opportunity to terminate a lease 
any of these situations may delay or eliminate proceeds or cash flows nnn expects from these projects  which could have an adverse effect on nnn s financial condition 
nnn may not be able to dispose of properties consistent with its operating strategy 
nnn may be unable to sell properties targeted for disposition due to adverse market conditions 
this may adversely affect  among other things  nnn s ability to sell under favorable terms  execute its operating strategy  achieve target earnings or returns  retire or repay debt or pay dividends 
a change in the assumptions used to determine the value of commercial mortgage residual interests could adversely affect nnn s financial position 
as of december   the residuals had a carrying value of  the value of these residuals is based on assumptions made by nnn to determine their value 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  discount rate  loan loss  prepayment speed and interest rate assumptions made by nnn to determine their value 
if actual experience differs materially from these assumptions  the actual future cash flow could be less than expected and the value of the residuals  as well as nnn s earnings  could decline 
nnn may suffer a loss in the event of a default or bankruptcy of a borrower 
if a borrower defaults on a mortgage  structured finance loan or other loan made by nnn  and does not have sufficient assets to satisfy the loan  nnn may suffer a loss of principal and interest 
in the event of the bankruptcy of a borrower  nnn may not be able to recover against all or any of the assets of the borrower  or the assets of the borrower may not be sufficient to satisfy the balance due on the loan 
in addition  certain of nnn s loans may be subordinate to other debt of a borrower 
these investments are typically loans secured by a borrower s pledge of its ownership interests in the entity that owns the real estate or other assets 
these agreements are typically subordinated to senior loans secured by other loans encumbering the underlying real estate or assets 
subordinated positions are generally subject to a higher risk of nonpayment of principal and interest than the more senior loans 
as of december   mortgages and notes receivables had an outstanding principal balance of  if a borrower defaults on the debt senior to nnn s loan  or in the event of the bankruptcy of a borrower  nnn s loan will be satisfied only after the borrower s senior creditors claims are satisfied 
where debt senior to nnn s loans exists  
table of contents the presence of intercreditor arrangements may limit nnn s ability to amend loan documents  assign the loans  accept prepayments  exercise remedies and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers 
bankruptcy proceedings and litigation can significantly increase the time needed for nnn to acquire underlying collateral  if any  in the event of a default  during which time the collateral may decline in value 
in addition  there are significant costs and delays associated with the foreclosure process 
certain provisions of nnn s leases or loan agreements may be unenforceable 
nnn s rights and obligations with respect to its leases  structured finance loans  mortgage loans or other loans are governed by written agreements 
a court could determine that one or more provisions of such an agreement are unenforceable  such as a particular remedy  a loan prepayment provision or a provision governing nnn s security interest in the underlying collateral of a borrower or lessee 
nnn could be adversely impacted if this were to happen with respect to an asset or group of assets 
property ownership through joint ventures and partnerships could limit nnn s control of those investments 
joint ventures or partnerships involve risks not otherwise present for direct investments by nnn 
it is possible that nnn s co venturers or partners may have different interests or goals than nnn at any time and they may take actions contrary to nnn s requests  policies or objectives  including nnn s policy with respect to maintaining its qualification as a reit 
other risks of joint venture or partnership investments include impasses on decisions because in some instances no single co venturer or partner has full control over the joint venture or partnership  respectively  or the co venturer or partner may become insolvent  bankrupt or otherwise unable to contribute to the joint venture or partnership  respectively 
further  disputes may develop with a co venturer or partner over decisions affecting the property  joint venture or partnership that may result in litigation  arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution 
competition with numerous other reits  commercial developers  real estate limited partnerships and other investors may impede nnn s ability to grow 
nnn may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to complete suitable property acquisitions or developments on advantageous terms due to competition for such properties with others engaged in real estate investment activities 
nnn s inability to successfully acquire or develop new properties may affect nnn s ability to achieve anticipated return on investment or realize its investment strategy  which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 
nnn s loss of key management could adversely affect performance and the value of its common stock 
nnn is dependent on the efforts of its key management 
competition for senior management personnel can be intense and nnn may not be able to retain its key management 
although nnn believes qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key management  the loss of their services could adversely affect nnn s performance and the value of its common stock 
operating losses from retail operations on certain properties may adversely impact nnn s results of operations 
in june  nnn acquired the operations of an auto service business that was operated on certain properties 
a third party manages and staffs these operations on behalf of nnn 
the results of business operations from these properties are subject to the typical execution risks inherent with many retail operations including merchandising  pricing  customer service  competition  consumer preferences and behavior  safety  compliance with various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  environmental contamination  weather conditions  or other trends in the markets they serve 
these factors could negatively impact nnn s results of operations from these certain properties 
uninsured losses may adversely affect nnn s ability to pay outstanding indebtedness 
nnn s properties are generally covered by comprehensive liability  fire  and extended insurance coverage 
nnn believes that the insurance carried on its properties is adequate and in accordance with industry standards 
there are  however  types of losses such as from hurricanes  earthquakes or other types of natural disasters or wars or other acts of violence which may be uninsurable  or the cost of insuring against these losses may not be economically justifiable 
if an uninsured loss occurs or a loss exceeds policy limits  nnn could lose both its invested capital and anticipated revenues from the property  thereby reducing nnn s cash flow and asset value 

table of contents acts of violence  terrorist attacks or war may affect the markets in which nnn operates and nnn s results of operations 
terrorist attacks or other acts of violence may negatively affect nnn s operations 
there can be no assurance that there will not be terrorist attacks against businesses within the united states 
these attacks may directly impact nnn s physical facilities or the businesses or the financial condition of its tenants  developers  borrowers  lenders or financial institutions with which nnn has a relationship 
the united states is engaged in armed conflict  which could have an impact on these parties 
the consequences of armed conflict are unpredictable  and nnn may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on its business 
more generally  any of these events or threats of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economies 
they also could result in  or cause a deepening of  economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have an adverse impact on nnn s financial condition or results of operations 
vacant properties or bankrupt tenants could adversely affect nnn s business or financial condition 
as of december   nnn owned vacant  un leased properties  which accounted for approximately three percent of total properties held in nnn s property portfolio 
nnn is actively marketing these properties for sale or lease but may not be able to sell or lease these properties on favorable terms or at all 
the lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from the rejection by any bankrupt tenant of any of their respective leases with nnn could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations of nnn if nnn is unable to re lease the properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner 
as of january   less than one percent of the total gross leasable area of nnn s property portfolio was leased to four tenants that have filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code and have the right to reject or affirm their leases with nnn 
the amount of debt nnn has and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect nnn s business and financial condition 
as of december   nnn had total mortgage debt outstanding of approximately  total unsecured notes payable of  and  outstanding on the credit facility 
nnn s organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that it may incur 
if nnn incurs additional indebtedness and permits a higher degree of leverage  debt service requirements would increase and could adversely affect nnn s financial condition and results of operations  as well as nnn s ability to pay principal and interest on the outstanding indebtedness or cash dividends to its stockholders 
in addition  increased leverage could increase the risk that nnn may default on its debt obligations 
the amount of debt outstanding at any time could have important consequences to nnn s stockholders 
for example  it could require nnn to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its debt  thereby reducing funds available for operations  real estate investments and other business opportunities that may arise in the future  increase nnn s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit nnn s ability to obtain any additional financing it may need in the future for working capital  debt refinancing  capital expenditures  real estate investments  development or other general corporate purposes  make it difficult to satisfy nnn s debt service requirements  limit nnn s ability to pay dividends in cash on its outstanding common and preferred stock  limit nnn s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and the factors that affect the profitability of its business  and limit nnn s flexibility in conducting its business  which may place nnn at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt or debt with less restrictive terms 
nnn s ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on its debt  or to retire or refinance such debt will depend primarily on its future performance  which to a certain extent is subject to the creditworthiness of its tenants  competition  and economic  financial  and other factors beyond its control 
there can be no assurance that nnn s business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt or meet its other cash needs 
if nnn is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from its business  it may be required to refinance all or a portion of its existing debt  sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet its debt obligations and other cash needs 
nnn cannot assure stockholders that any such refinancing  sale of assets or additional financing would be possible or  if possible  on terms and conditions  including but not limited to the interest rate  which nnn would find acceptable or would not result in a material decline in earnings 

table of contents nnn is obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in its debt instruments that could restrict its operating activities  and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate the payment of such debt 
as of december   nnn had approximately  of outstanding indebtedness  of which approximately  was secured indebtedness 
nnn s unsecured debt instruments contains various restrictive covenants which include  among others  provisions restricting nnn s ability to incur or guarantee additional debt  make certain distributions  investments and other restricted payments  enter into transactions with certain affiliates  create certain liens  consolidate  merge or sell nnn s assets  and pre pay debt 
nnn s secured debt instruments generally contains customary covenants  including  among others  provisions relating to the maintenance of the property securing the debt  restricting its ability to sell  assign or further encumber the properties securing the debt  restricting its ability to incur additional debt  restricting its ability to amend or modify existing leases  and relating to certain prepayment restrictions 
nnn s ability to meet some of its debt covenants  including covenants related to the condition of the property or payment of real estate taxes  may be dependent on the performance by nnn s tenants under their leases 
in addition  certain covenants in nnn s debt instruments  including its credit facility  require nnn  among other things  to limit certain leverage ratios  maintain certain minimum interest and debt service coverage ratios  and limit investments in certain types of assets 
nnn s failure to comply with certain of its debt covenants could result in defaults that accelerate the payment under such debt and limit the dividends paid to nnn s common and preferred stockholders which would likely have a material adverse impact on nnn s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  these defaults could impair its access to the debt and equity markets 
the market value of nnn s equity and debt securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility 
as with other publicly traded securities  the market price of nnn s equity and debt securities depends on various factors  which may change from time to time and or may be unrelated to nnn s financial condition  operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices 
these factors  among others  include general economic and financial market conditions including the weak economic environment  level and trend of interest rates  nnn s ability to access the capital markets to raise additional capital  the issuance of additional equity or debt securities  changes in nnn s funds from operations or earnings estimates  changes in nnn s debt ratings or analyst ratings  nnn s financial condition and performance  market perception of nnn compared to other reits  and market perception of reits compared to other investment sectors 

table of contents nnn s failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes could result in significant tax liability 
nnn intends to operate in a manner that will allow nnn to continue to qualify as a reit 
nnn believes it has been organized as  and its past and present operations qualify nnn as a reit 
however  the internal revenue service irs could successfully assert that nnn is not qualified as such 
in addition  nnn may not remain qualified as a reit in the future 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within nnn s control 
furthermore  new tax legislation  administrative guidance or court decisions  in each instance potentially with retroactive effect  could make it more difficult or impossible for nnn to qualify as a reit or avoid significant tax liability 
if nnn fails to qualify as a reit  it would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing taxable income and would become subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
in this event  nnn could be subject to potentially significant tax liabilities and penalties 
unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  nnn would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost 
even if nnn remains qualified as a reit  nnn may face other tax liabilities that reduce operating results and cash flow 
even if nnn remains qualified for taxation as a reit  nnn may be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on its income and assets  including taxes on any undistributed income  tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure  and state or local income  property and transfer taxes  such as mortgage recording taxes 
any of these taxes would decrease earnings and cash available for distribution to stockholders 
in addition  in order to meet the reit qualification requirements  nnn holds some of its assets through the trs 
adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes could reduce nnn s earnings  cash flow and market price of nnn s common stock 
at any time  the federal and state income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may change 
any such changes may have retroactive effect  and could adversely affect nnn or its stockholders 
for example  legislation enacted in and extended in generally reduced the federal income tax rate on most dividends paid by corporations to individual investors to a maximum of percent through 
reit dividends  with limited exceptions  will not benefit from the rate reduction  because a reit s income generally is not subject to corporate level tax 
as such  this legislation could cause shares in non reit corporations to be a more attractive investment to individual investors than shares in reits  and could have an adverse effect on the value of nnn s common stock 
compliance with reit requirements  including distribution requirements  may limit nnn s flexibility and negatively affect nnn s operating decisions 
to maintain its status as a reit for us federal income tax purposes  nnn must meet certain requirements on an on going basis  including requirements regarding its sources of income  the nature and diversification of its assets  the amounts nnn distributes to its stockholders and the ownership of its shares 
nnn may also be required to make distributions to its stockholders when it does not have funds readily available for distribution or at times when nnn s funds are otherwise needed to fund capital expenditures or debt service requirements 
nnn generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on amounts distributed to stockholders  providing it distributes percent of its reit taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a reit 
for each of the years in the three year period ended december   nnn believes it has qualified as a reit 
notwithstanding nnn s qualification for taxation as a reit  nnn is subject to certain state taxes on its income and real estate 
changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely impact nnn s or nnn s tenants reported financial performance 
accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how nnn records and reports its financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time the financial accounting standards board fasb and the commission  who create and interpret appropriate accounting standards  may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of nnn s financial statements 
these changes could have a material impact on nnn s reported financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  nnn could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in restating prior period financial statements 
similarly  these changes could have a material impact on nnn s tenants reported financial condition or results of operations and affect their preferences regarding leasing real estate

the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit developed funds from operations ffo as a relative non gaap financial measure of performance of a reit in order to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
ffo is defined by nareit and is used by nnn as follows net earnings computed in accordance with gaap plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  excluding gains or including losses on the disposition of certain assets  any impairment charges on a depreciable real estate asset and nnn s share of these items from nnn s unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is generally considered by industry analysts to be an appropriate measure of operating performance of real estate companies 
ffo does not necessarily represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of nnn s operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
management considers ffo an appropriate measure of operating performance of an equity reit because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  and because industry analysts have accepted it as an operating performance measure 
nnn s 
table of contents computation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo used by other equity reits  and therefore  may not be comparable to such other reits 
all revenue generating property dispositions and revenue generating properties held for sale at december  from nnn s property portfolio are classified as discontinued operations 
these properties have not historically been classified as discontinued operations  therefore  prior period comparable consolidated financial statements have been restated to include these properties in its earnings from discontinued operations 
these adjustments resulted in a decrease in nnn s reported total revenues and total and per share earnings from continuing operations and an increase in nnn s earnings from discontinued operations

the term nnn or the company refers to national retail properties  inc and all of its consolidated subsidiaries 
nnn has elected to treat certain subsidiaries as taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries and their majority owned and controlled subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the trs 
overview nnn  a maryland corporation  is a fully integrated real estate investment trust reit formed in nnn assets include real estate assets  mortgages and notes receivable  and commercial mortgage residual interests 
nnn acquires  owns  invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long term net leases and primarily held for investment properties or property portfolio 
prior to december   nnn reported its operations in two primary business segments  investment assets and inventory assets 
as a result of a continued reduction of investments in real estate acquired for the purpose of resale  the previously reported segment of inventory assets no longer meets the criteria for significance for separate segment reporting 
currently  nnn s operations are reported within one business segment in the financial statements and all properties are considered part of the properties or property portfolio 
as such  property counts and calculations involving property counts reflect all nnn properties 
as of december   nnn owned  properties including properties with retail operations that nnn operates  with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately  square feet  located in states 
approximately percent of total properties in the property portfolio was leased or operated as of december  nnn s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of nnn 
the key indicators for nnn include items such as the composition of the property portfolio such as tenant  geographic and line of trade diversification  the occupancy rate of the property portfolio  certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures  and industry trends and performance compared to that of nnn 
nnn continues to maintain its diversification by tenant  geography and tenant s line of trade 
nnn s highest lines of trade concentrations are the convenience store and restaurant including full and limited service sectors 
these sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and nnn s management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities 
nnn s property portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast united states  which are regions of historically above average population growth 
given these concentrations  any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic locations  respectively  could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of nnn 
as of years end december   and  properties have remained at least percent leased 
nnn s property portfolio s average remaining lease term of years has remained fairly constant over the past three years which  coupled with its net lease structure  provides enhanced probability of maintaining occupancy and operating earnings 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of nnn s consolidated financial statements in conformance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments on assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as other disclosures in the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions  which in turn could have a material impact on nnn s financial statements 
a summary of nnn s accounting policies and procedures are included in note of nnn s consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of nnn s consolidated financial statements 
real estate portfolio 
nnn records the acquisition of real estate at cost  including acquisition and closing costs 
the cost of properties developed by nnn includes direct and indirect costs of construction  property taxes  interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy 

table of contents purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate subject to a lease 
in accordance with the fasb guidance on business combinations  the fair value of the real estate acquired with in place leases is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and tenant improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  value of in place leases  and value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their relative fair values 
nnn s real estate is generally leased to tenants on a net lease basis  whereby the tenant is responsible for all operating expenses relating to the property  generally including property taxes  insurance  maintenance and repairs 
the leases are accounted for using either the operating or the direct financing method 
such methods are described below operating method properties with leases accounted for using the operating method are recorded at the cost of the real estate 
revenue is recognized as rentals are earned and expenses including depreciation are charged to operations as incurred 
buildings are depreciated on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
leasehold interests are amortized on the straight line method over the terms of their respective leases 
when scheduled rental revenue varies during the lease term  income is recognized on a straight line basis so as to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the lease 
accrued rental income is the aggregate difference between the scheduled rents which vary during the lease term and the income recognized on a straight line basis 
direct financing method properties with leases accounted for using the direct financing method are recorded at their net investment which at the inception of the lease generally represents the cost of the property 
unearned income is deferred and amortized into income over the lease terms so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on nnn s net investment in the leases 
impairment real estate 
based upon the events or changes in certain circumstances  management periodically assesses its properties for possible impairment indicating that the carrying value of the asset  including accrued rental income  may not be recoverable through operations 
events or circumstances that may occur include significant changes in real estate market condition or the ability of nnn to re lease or sell properties that are vacant or become vacant 
management determines whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  including the residual value of the real estate  with the carrying cost of the individual asset 
if an impairment is indicated  a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
commercial mortgage residual interests  at fair value 
commercial mortgage residual interests  classified as available for sale  are reported at their market values with unrealized gains and losses reported as other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
nnn recognizes the excess of all cash flows attributable to the commercial mortgage residual interests estimated at the acquisition transaction date over the initial investment the accretable yield as interest income over the life of the beneficial interest using the effective yield method 
losses are considered other than temporary valuation impairments if and when there has been a change in the timing or amount of estimated cash flows  exclusive of changes in interest rates  that leads to a loss in value 
in  nnn acquired the non controlling interest in its majority owned and controlled subsidiary  orange avenue mortgage investments  inc oami  for  pursuant to which oami became a wholly owned subsidiary of nnn 
nnn accounted for the transaction as an equity transaction in accordance with the fasb guidance on consolidation 
revenue recognition 
rental revenues for non development real estate assets are recognized when earned in accordance with the fasb guidance on accounting for leases  based on the terms of the lease at the time of acquisition of the leased asset 
rental revenues for properties under construction commence upon completion of construction of the leased asset and delivery of the leased asset to the tenant 
new accounting pronouncements 
refer to note of the december   consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
additional critical accounting policies of nnn include management s estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
additional critical accounting policies include management s estimates of the useful lives used in calculating depreciation expense relating to real estate assets  the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  including the commercial mortgage residual interests  the recoverability of the income tax benefit  and the collectibility of receivables from tenants  including accrued rental income 
actual results could differ from those estimates

table of contents impact of inflation nnn s leases typically contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on nnn s results of operations 
tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases  increases in the consumer price index  and or  to a lesser extent  increases in the tenant s sales volume 
during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent  rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 
properties are leased to tenants under long term  net leases which typically require the tenant to pay certain operating expenses for a property  thus  nnn s exposure to inflation is reduced 
inflation may have an adverse impact on nnn s tenants 
liquidity general 
nnn s demand for funds has been and will continue to be primarily for i payment of operating expenses and cash dividends  ii property acquisitions and development  iii origination of mortgages and notes receivable  iv capital expenditures  v payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness  and vi other investments

table of contents financing strategy 
nnn s financing objective is to manage its capital structure effectively in order to provide sufficient capital to execute its operating strategy while servicing its debt requirements and providing value to nnn s stockholders 
nnn generally utilizes debt and equity security offerings  bank borrowings  the sale of properties  and to a lesser extent  internally generated funds to meet its capital needs 
nnn typically funds its short term liquidity requirements  including investments in additional properties  with cash from its credit facility 
as of december    was outstanding and  was available for future borrowings under the credit facility  excluding undrawn letters of credit totaling  for the year ended december   nnn s ratio of total liabilities to total gross assets before accumulated depreciation was approximately percent and the ratio of secured indebtedness to total gross assets was approximately one percent 
the ratio of total debt to total market capitalization was approximately percent 
certain financial agreements to which nnn is a party contain covenants that limit nnn s ability to incur debt under certain circumstances 
the organizational documents of nnn do not limit the absolute amount or percentage of indebtedness that nnn may incur 
additionally  nnn may change its financing strategy 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the information in the following table summarizes nnn s contractual obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of december  the table presents principal cash flows by year end of the expected maturity for debt obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of december  expected maturity date dollars in thousands total thereafter long term debt credit facility operating leases total contractual cash obligations includes amounts outstanding under mortgages payable  convertible notes payable and notes payable and excludes unamortized note discounts 
excludes  of accrued interest payable 
maturity dates are based on put option dates under nnn s convertible notes

in addition to items reflected in the table  nnn has issued preferred stock with cumulative preferential cash distributions  as described below under dividends 
management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of nnn s cash provided from operations  current capital resources on hand  its credit facility  debt or equity financings and asset dispositions 
generally the properties are leased under long term net leases 
therefore  management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital 
certain of nnn s properties are subject to leases under which nnn retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the property 
management anticipates the costs associated with nnn s vacant properties or those properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital 
nnn may be required to borrow under its credit facility or use other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures 
the lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant properties or uncollectibility of lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if nnn is unable to release the properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner 
as of december   nnn owned vacant  un leased properties which accounted for approximately three percent of total properties held in nnn s property portfolio 
additionally  as of january   less 
table of contents than one percent of the total gross leasable area of nnn s property portfolio was leased to four tenants that filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code
