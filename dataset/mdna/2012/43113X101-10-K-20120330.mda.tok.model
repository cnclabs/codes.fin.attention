critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  actuarial valuations and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while for any given estimate or assumption made by our management there may be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable  we believe that  given the current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements 
the accounting principles we utilized in preparing our consolidated financial statements conform in all material respects to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  revenues  the allowance for doubtful receivables  recoverability of the carrying amount of inventory  fair values of financial instruments  and the assessment of deferred tax assets or liabilities 
these estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are stated at original amount less allowance made for doubtful receivables  if any  based on a review of all outstanding amounts at the period end 
an allowance is also made when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to original terms of receivables 
bad debts are written off when identified 
the company extend unsecured credit to customers in the normal course of business and believe all accounts receivable in excess of the allowances for doubtful receivables to be fully collectible

costs are determined on a weighted average method 
inventory includes raw materials  packing materials  work in progress and finished goods 
the variable production overhead is allocated to each unit of production on the basis of the actual use of the production facilities 
the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion is based on the normal capacity of the production facilities where there is evidence that the utility of inventories  in their disposal in the ordinary course of business  will be less than cost  whether due to physical deterioration  obsolescence  changes in price levels  or other causes  the inventories is written down to their fair value for the difference with charges to cost of sales 
an aggregate of  and  was written down for inventories as of december  and  respectively 
income taxes

the increase was due to a million increase in net sales of our lithium batteries resulting from a increase in the average selling price and an increase in the volume of batteries sold and an increase in revenues from our material business from million in to million in  which was partly offset by a million decrease in net sales of our ni mh battery units resulting from a decrease in the number of ni mh battery units sold partially offset by a increase in the average selling price of such batteries 
the increase in the number of lithium battery units sold in was primarily attributable to increased orders from our new and existing customers 
the increase in the average selling price of our lithium battery units was due to our sale of higher quality and higher capacity battery products  which we sold at higher selling prices 
cost of sales consists of the cost of nickel and other materials  labor  and overhead

gross profit margins are usually a factor of cost of sales  product mix and demand for products 
the decrease in our gross profit margin for the year ended december  is primarily due to a increase in the average unit cost of our ni mh batteries sold and a increase in the average unit cost of our lithium batteries sold 
in addition  gross profit from our materials business  which has lower gross profit margins than our other business operations decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  to cope with pressure on our gross margins we intend to control production costs by preparing budgets for each department and comparing actual costs with our budgeted figures monthly and quarterly 
additionally  we have reorganized the company s production structure and have focused more attention on employee training to enhance efficiency 
we also intend to expand our market share by investing in greater promotion of our products in regions such as the us  russia  europe and india  and by expanding our sales team with more experienced sales personnel

research and development expenses were million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   as compared to million for the comparable period in the increase was due to the expansion of our workforce to expand our research and development and management functions 
we experienced losses on the exchange rate difference between the us dollar and the rmb of  and  respectively  in the years ended december  and  due to the devaluation of the us dollar relative to the rmb over the respective periods 
in and  to cope with devaluation of the us dollar relative to the rmb  we engaged in currency forward and adjusted the selling price of batteries to vary with the us dollar exchange rate relative to the rmb 
other income consists of subsidy income  bank interest income and sundry income 
other income was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due to an increase of  of subsidy income from the government  an increase of  in bank interest income  and an increase of  in sundry income 
interest expenses were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the respective comparable period in the increase was primarily due to an increase in both our weighted average bank borrowings and the weighted average bank loan interest on our outstanding borrowings

net loss for the year ended december  was million  compared to net income of million for the comparable period in  a decrease of 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million as of december   as compared to million as of december  our funds are kept in financial institutions located in the prc  which do not provide insurance for amounts on deposit 
moreover  we are subject to the regulations of the prc which restrict the transfer of cash from the prc  except under certain specific circumstances 
accordingly  such funds may not be readily available to us to satisfy obligations which have been incurred outside the prc 
to provide liquidity and flexibility in funding our operations  we borrow amounts under bank facilities and other external sources of financing 
as of december   we had in place general banking facilities with nine financial institutions aggregating million 
the maturity of these facilities is generally less than two years 
the facilities are subject to annual review and approval 
certain of these banking facilities are guaranteed by our chief executive officer  mr 
dang yu pan  and contain customary affirmative and negative covenants for secured credit facilities of this type 
however  these covenants do not have any impact on our ability to undertake additional debt or equity financing 
interest rates are generally based on the banks reference lending rates 
no significant commitment fees are required to be paid for the banking facilities 
as of december   we had utilized approximately million under such general credit facilities and had available unused credit facilities of million 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the comparable period in the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to the increase in prepayments and other receivables and accounts payable which was significantly offset by the decrease of accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in the net increase of million in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in the acquisition of plant and equipment in for the new factory under construction in huizhou  which we expect will be operational in june we are equipping the factory with new machines with more advanced manufacturing capabilities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the comparable period in the net decrease of million is primarily attributable to an increase of million in the repayment of short term bank loans  an increase of million in the repayment of notes payable  an increase of million in the repayment of letter of credit  and a significant increase of million in restricted cash  which was partly offset by an increase of million in proceeds from bank borrowings  an increase of million in proceeds from notes payable and an increase of million in proceeds from letters of credit 
the increase in repayment of bank borrowings  notes payable and letter of credit are due to their maturity  and the increase in restricted cash resulted from the increase in proceeds from bank borrowings 
the increases in proceeds from bank borrowings  notes payable and letters of credit are due to the expansion of our business and our need for more operating funds 
for fiscal year and  our inventory turnover was and times  respectively 
the average days outstanding of our accounts receivable at december  were days  as compared to days at december  inventory turnover and average days outstanding are key operating measures that management relies on to monitor our business 
in the next months  we expect to expand our research  development and manufacturing of lithium based batteries and anticipate additional capital expenditures of approximately million  which will be paid out of cash on hand 
we are required to contribute a portion of our employees total salaries to the chinese government s social insurance funds  including retirement pension  medical insurance  unemployment insurance and job injuries insurance  and a housing assistance fund  in accordance with relevant regulations 
we expect these contributions will contribute to administrative and other operating expenses in an amount of approximately  per month based on the size of our current workforce 
we expect the amount of our contribution to the government s social insurance funds to increase in the future as we expand our workforce and operations 
based upon our present plans  we believe that cash on hand  cash flows from operations and funds available under our bank facilities will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for the next months 
however  our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity depends partially on our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue  while continuing to control costs 
if we did not have sufficient available cash  we would have to seek additional debt or equity financing through other external sources  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to maintain financing arrangements on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the use of working capital is primarily for the maintenance of our accounts receivable and inventory 
we provide our major customers with payment terms ranging from to days 
additionally  our production lead time is approximately to days  from the inspection of incoming materials  to production  testing and packaging 
we need to keep a large supply of raw materials and work in process and finished goods inventory on hand to ensure timely delivery of our products to our customers 
we use two methods to support our working capital needs paying our suppliers under payment terms ranging from to days  and using short term bank loans 
we use accounts receivable as collateral for our loans 
upon receiving payment for accounts receivable  we pay our short term loans 
our working capital management practices are designed to ensure that we maintain sufficient working capital 
guarantees of bank loans mr 
dang yu pan  our chairman and chief executive officer  has provided personal guarantees under our outstanding banking facilities 
sz highpower  sz springpower and hkhtc also provided guarantees for fellow subsidiaries 
the following table shows the amount outstanding on each of our bank loans as of december  and the guarantors of each loan 
name of bank amount granted amount outstanding under loan guaranteed by standard chartered bank hong kong million million cash rmb in bank shenzhen development bank co  ltd million million dang yu pan and sz springpower industrial and commercial bank of china million million dang yu pan  sz springpower and hkhtc citibank hong kong co  ltd 
million million sz highpower standard chartered bank shenzhen branch million million dang yu pan and sz springpower china everbright bank million million xiamen tungsten co  ltd wing lung bank hong kong million total million million we did not and do not intend to pay any compensation to the guarantor for the guarantees 
inflation and seasonality inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the last two fiscal years 
however  the volatile nickel prices affect our cost of sales constantly 
in times of economic downturn  nickel prices tend to decline  and our gross margin tends to be higher than the periods when of economy growth  which usually brings higher metal prices 
the first quarter of each fiscal year tend to be our slow season due to the chinese new year holidays 
our factories  according to our order backlog  usually shut down for weeks 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet debt  nor do we have any transactions  arrangements or relationships with any special purpose entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk credit risk we are exposed to credit risk from our cash at bank  fixed deposits and contract receivables 
the credit risk on cash at bank and fixed deposits is limited because the counterparts are recognized financial institutions 
contract receivables are subject to credit evaluations 
we periodically record a provision for doubtful collections based on an evaluation of the collectability of contract receivables by assessing  among other factors  the customer s willingness or ability to pay  repayment history  general economic conditions and our ongoing relationship with the customers 
foreign currency and exchange risk the company maintains its financial statements in the functional currency of renminbi rmb 
substantially all of our operations are conducted in the prc and we pay the majority of expenses in rmb 
approximately of our sales are made in us dollars 
during the year ended december   the exchange rate of the rmb to the us dollar increased approximately from the level at the end of december  this fluctuation resulted in a slight increase in our material costs during the year ended december  a future appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar would increase our costs when translated into us dollars and could adversely affect our margins unless we make sufficient offsetting sales 
conversion of rmb into foreign currencies is regulated by the people s bank of china through a unified floating exchange rate system 
although the prc government has stated its intention to support the value of the rmb  there can be no assurance that such exchange rate will not continue to appreciate significantly against the us dollar 
exchange rate fluctuations may also affect the value  in us dollar terms  of our net assets 
in addition  the rmb is not freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions 
due to the volatility of the us dollar to our functional currency the company put into place a hedging program to attempt to protect it from significant changes to the us dollar which affects the value of its us dollar receivables and sales 
as of december   the company had a series of currency forwards totaling a notional amount million expiring from january to april the terms of these derivative contracts are generally for months or less 
changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts are recorded in earnings to offset the impact of loss on derivative instruments 
the net gains of  attributable to these activities are included in loss on derivative instruments for the year ended december  country risk the substantial portion of our business  assets and operations are located and conducted in hong kong and china 
while these economies have experienced significant growth in the past twenty years  growth has been uneven  both geographically and among various sectors of the economy 
the chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources 
some of these measures benefit the overall economy of hong kong and china  but may also have a negative effect on highpower international 
for example  highpower international s operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations applicable to highpower international 
if there are any changes in any policies by the chinese government and highpower international s business is negatively affected as a result  then highpower international s financial results  including our ability to generate revenues and profits  will also be negatively affected
