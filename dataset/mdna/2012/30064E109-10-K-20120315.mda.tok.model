other expenses  net of other income  decreased to million in from million in  as interest expense decreased due to lower interest rates during the year  as well as a gain on foreign currency transactions 
looking forward  we expect other expenses  net of other income  to increase as interest expense is incurred on increased average borrowings outstanding under our line of credit for the full year 
taxes and net income income before provision for income taxes decreased in from the effective income tax rate  as a percentage of income before taxes  for was  as compared to in the decrease in the effective rate during was primarily due to a larger percentage of our sales and profits being in tax jurisdictions outside the us with lower effective tax rates 
income before provision for income taxes increased in from the effective income tax rate  as a percentage of income before taxes  for was  as compared to in the increase in the effective rate during was primarily the result of losses incurred in the direct sales operations that did not result in effective tax rate benefit during in  we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately based on the expected mix of international sales and profits

our non gaap financial results and metrics of sales and operating expenses on a constant currency basis are provided to assist investors in the comparison of our operating performance without the impact of currency exchange fluctuations related to our operations where the functional currency is not in us dollars  or usd 
financial results and metrics that are adjusted for constant currency are calculated by restating current period activity into usd using the comparable prior period s foreign currency exchange rates 
our non gaap financial measures of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the charges we incurred in relation to the doj inquiry in and the dpa related monitorship and enhanced hcp compliance program costs in  less the tax effect of the charges 
because the doj inquiry and dpa related monitorship costs are unique events  not directly related to our normal operations  we believe these non gaap financial measures may help investors better understand and compare our operating results and trends by eliminating the unusual components included in gaap financial measures

liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations through a combination of commercial debt financing  sales of equity securities and cash flows from operating activities 
at december   we had working capital of million  an increase of from million at the end of working capital in increased due to the increased accounts receivable resulting from our sales increase during we expect that cash flows from operating activities and borrowing under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our commitments and cash requirements in the following twelve months and for the foreseeable future 
if not  we will seek additional funding options with any number of possible combinations of additional debt  additional equity or convertible debt 
see item a 
risk factors for discussion on the capital markets 
operating activities operating activities provided net cash of million for  as compared to million in  partially as a result of a decrease in total inventory of million as compared to an increase in inventory of million in looking forward  we anticipate the inventory balance to be relatively stable during the first quarter of and then increase during the second and third quarters of due to new product releases and inventory increases in our distribution subsidiaries and then stabilize again by year end 

table of contents in our total accounts receivable balances increased to million from million in and the total days sales outstanding dso ratio  based on average accounts receivable balances  increased from for to for as we continue to expand our operations internationally  our dso ratio could continue to increase  as international credit terms tend to be longer than the credit terms in the united states 
our allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return allowance at december   increased to million as compared to million at december   principally as a result of the overall increase in total accounts receivable outstanding 
we cannot give assurances that the transitioning to direct sales outside the united states will not result in a larger amount of bad debt expense and a corresponding increase in this allowance 
there have not been any significant changes in our credit terms and policies and we anticipate accounts receivable to continue to increase based on sales growth 
litigation there are various claims  lawsuits  and disputes with third parties and pending actions involving various allegations against us incident to the operation of our business  principally product liability cases 
we are currently a party to a products liability suit related to the products distributed by us on behalf of rti biologics  inc  or rti 
pursuant to our license and distribution agreement with rti  we have tendered the case to rti 
while we believe that the claim is without merit  we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this and other such litigation 
we therefore maintain insurance  subject to self insured retention limits  for all such claims  and establish accruals for product liability and other claims based upon our experience with similar past claims  advice of counsel and the best information available 
at december   we had  accrued for product liability claims and as of december   we did not have any accruals for product liability claims 
these matters are subject to various uncertainties  and it is possible that they may be resolved unfavorably to us 
however  while it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of the various cases  it is the opinion of management that  upon ultimate resolution  the cases will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our insurance policies covering product liability claims must be renewed annually 
although we have been able to obtain insurance coverage concerning product liability claims at a cost and on other terms and conditions that are acceptable to us  we may not be able to procure acceptable policies in the future 
on december   we entered into a twelve month deferred prosecution agreement  or dpa  with the united states attorney s office for the district of new jersey  or the usao  and a five year corporate integrity agreement  or cia  with the office of the inspector general of the united states department of health and human services 
pursuant to a related civil settlement agreement csa  we settled civil and administrative claims relating to the matter for a payment of million  without any admission by the company 
we previously accrued approximately million for an anticipated settlement and legal expenses related to this investigation  and therefore  these agreements did not materially impact our results of operations 
the foregoing agreements  together with a related settlement agreement  resolve the investigation commenced by the usao in december into our consulting arrangements with orthopaedic surgeons relating to our hip and knee products in the united states  which we refer to as the subject matter 
as set forth in the dpa  the usao specifically acknowledges that it does not allege that our conduct adversely affected patient health or patient care 
pursuant to the dpa  the usao has agreed not to prosecute us in connection with the subject matter provided that we comply with our obligations under the dpa during its term

on march   upon the recommendation of the monitor and the agreement of the usao  the company successfully concluded the dpa 
we continue to enhance and apply our corporate compliance program  and we monitor our practices on an ongoing basis to ensure that we have in place proper controls necessary to comply with applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business

additionally  the new credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring that we maintain a leverage ratio of not greater than to and a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the new credit agreement of not less than to 
as of december   our cash and short term investments held in jurisdictions outside of the us were million  and are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for use in foreign operations 
cash balances held in the us are swept into our swing line note  as discussed above  to reduce any outstanding balances due under that debt instrument 
other commitments and contingencies at december   we had outstanding commitments for the purchase of inventory  raw materials and supplies of million and outstanding commitments for the purchase of capital equipment of million 
purchases under our distribution agreements were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
as of december   we recorded a contingent liability of million based on the estimated weighted probability of the outcome of a claim by the state of florida for sales and use tax  based on the state s audit of such tax dating back to may  which was assessed by the state of florida for the value of surgical instruments removed from inventory and capitalized as property and equipment worldwide 
in consultation with counsel  management protested the assessment 
in evaluating the liability  management followed the fasb guidance on contingencies  and concluded that the contingent liability was probable  based on verbal assertions by florida department of revenue personnel  and could be reasonably estimated  however if we are unsuccessful in our protest against the state of florida  we could have a maximum potential liability of million for the tax period audited through december  any use tax determined to be due and payable to the florida department of revenue will increase the basis of the surgical instruments and this amount will be amortized over the remaining useful life of the instruments 
during march we received an unfavorable decision on our protest of the assessment for million for use tax and interest through the year we are currently evaluating administrative hearing and legal options to contest this decision  however  there can be no assurances that we will ultimately prevail in our approach against the decision 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth our contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter commercial construction loan commercial real estate loan line of credit interest on long term debt operating leases capital lease minimum lease payments other long term obligations purchase obligations based on outstanding balances  term dates and interest rates on our variable rate debt at december   we have made certain estimates to forecast our payments of interest on our outstanding debt 
we assume relatively stable interest rates  full payment of our debt instruments by due dates  and no additional lending other than under our line of credit 
this estimate is subject to uncertainty due to the variable nature of the interest rates and revolving nature of our line of credit 
should interest rates vary significantly  our estimate could be materially different from actual results 
other long term obligations include long term liabilities assumed as a part of our acquisitions during during the first quarter of  we entered into the new credit agreement and paid in full the outstanding debt obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or any unconsolidated  special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this annual report on form k is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in management s opinion  our critical accounting policies include allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventories  intangible assets  subsidiary consolidation  accrued liabilities  stock based compensation  and provision for income taxes 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns our accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from hospitals  international government healthcare agencies and international distributors 
amounts due from international distributors carry longer payment terms than domestic customers  typically due in days 
we typically perform credit evaluations on our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we generally invoice sales to international distributors in us dollars and we are not subject to significant currency exchange rate risk on accounts receivable from international distributors although we do have exchange rate risk in receivables of our international subsidiaries 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to estimate the losses due to the inability to collect required payment from our customers for products and services rendered 
in calculating the allowance  we utilize a model that ages the accounts receivable and applies a progressively higher allowance percentage  based upon our historical 
table of contents experience with balances written off as uncollectible  to each tier of receivables past due terms 
should the financial condition of our customers deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required which would affect our future operating results due to increased expenses for the resulting uncollectible bad debt 
we grant sales returns on a case by case basis 
we calculate an allowance for returns based upon an analysis of our historical sales return experience 
at december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million as compared to million at december   which increased in correlation with our increase in sales and the extended payment time frame for certain subsidiaries customers 
as a percentage of accounts receivable  the allowance increased to as compared to at the prior year end 
included in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both and  was an allowance for the uncollectible amount of  of accounts receivable due from our prior spanish independent distributor 
at december   our allowance for sales returns was million compared to million at december   as a result of our international sales growth and an additional estimated sales return  net of cost of goods sold  of  related to the nonrenewal of our agreement with our spanish independent distributor 
as of december   the estimated sales return  net of cost of goods sold  related to the spanish independent distributor was million 
we cannot give assurances that the transitioning to direct sales outside the us will not result in a larger amount of returned products with a corresponding increase in this allowance 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on our domestic sales and sales from our international subsidiaries upon notification from our sales agents that a product or service has been implanted in a patient customer 
as this implantation represents delivery of our products and services without any right of return  we do not maintain an allowance for sales returns 
for sales to international independent distributors  revenue is recognized upon shipment as title  risk and rewards of ownership pass to the buyer and there typically are no contractual rights of return granted or post shipment obligations 
we estimate an allowance for sales returns on our international customers based upon an analysis of our prior returns experience 
we continually evaluate new and current customers for collectability based on various factors including  past history with the customer  evaluation of their credit worthiness  and current economic conditions 
excess and obsolete inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include implants consigned to customers and agents 
we also provide significant loaned implant inventory to non distributor customers 
the consigned or loaned inventory remains our inventory until we are notified of the implantation 
we are also required to maintain substantial levels of inventory as it is necessary to maintain all sizes of each component to fill customer orders 
the size of the component to be used for a specific patient is typically not known with certainty until the time of surgery 
due to this uncertainty  a minimum of one of each size of each component in the system to be used must be available to each sales representative at the time of surgery 
as a result of the need to maintain substantial levels of inventory  we are subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence 
in the event that a substantial portion of our inventory becomes obsolete  it would have a material adverse effect on the company 
charges for obsolete and slow moving inventories are recorded based upon an analysis of specific identification of obsolete inventory items and quantification of slow moving inventory items 
for slow moving inventory  this analysis compares the quantity of inventory on hand to the projected sales of such inventory items 
as a result of this analysis  we record an estimated charge for slow moving inventory in the form of an inventory impairment that increases cost of goods sold and decreases gross profit 
in circumstances  when the obsolete or slow moving inventory subsequently experiences increased sales and inventory that was previously impaired is sold  cost of goods sold is decreased and gross profit is increased 
charges for the years ended december    and were   and  respectively 
we also test our inventory levels for the amount of inventory that would be sold within one year 
at certain times  as we stock new subsidiaries  add consignment locations  and launch new products  the level of inventory can exceed the forecasted level of cost of goods sold for the next twelve months 
as of december   we determined that million of inventory should be classified as non current 
as of december   we determined that million of inventory should be classified as non current 
goodwill and other intangible assets we assess the value of goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with guidance from the financial accounting standards board  or fasb 
goodwill is not 
table of contents amortized but is evaluated for impairment  as of october each year  or sooner if an event occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit 
in testing goodwill for impairment  we compare the carrying value of goodwill to its fair value  using a discounted cash flow method of valuation 
in determining the fair value of goodwill  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows based on our estimated future net sales and operating expenses  as well as our estimated growth  as a result of projected market penetration and general economic conditions 
we initially allocate goodwill to the reporting units based on estimated future sales of the reporting units 
we allocate and test goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit level  which is aligned with our product lines and the way that our management analyzes and reviews the discrete financial information 
changes to these estimates could cause an impairment of goodwill to occur 
in assessing the value of other intangible assets  we make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows  economic life and other factors to determine fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge for these assets 
we analyze our other intangible assets for impairment issues on a quarterly and annual basis  if required 
subsidiary consolidation our wholly owned subsidiaries  exactech asia  exactech uk  ltd  exactech japan  france medica  exactech iberica  exactech deutschland  exactech taiwan  and exactech international operations  ltd are fully consolidated after all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 
accrued liabilities we are subject to various claims  lawsuits  disputes with third parties and actions involving various allegations against us incident to the operation of our business  principally product liability claims 
we accrue liabilities for such claims that are deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable based upon our experience with similar past claims  advice of counsel and the best information available 
if one or both of these criteria are not met  we disclose the loss contingency if it is reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred 
should the outcome of any pending  threatened  or future litigation have an outcome unfavorable to us  it may affect future operating results due to the resulting increases in operating expenses associated with such litigation 
as of december   we have accrued charges of approximately million for an estimate of the outcome of a claim by the state of florida for sales and use tax  based on the state s audit of such tax dating back to may  of which  has been assessed by the state of florida as of december   for the value of surgical instruments removed from inventory and capitalized as property and equipment worldwide 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the state of florida assessment 
provision for income taxes we must use estimates and professional judgment in calculating the provision for income taxes in determining the deductibility and technical merit of the positions taken on our tax returns 
in accordance with fasb guidance  we evaluate our tax positions each reporting period to determine if they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination  and measure the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
should any of our tax positions be determined to be uncertain  it may result in an increase in current and or future taxes due 
the fasb guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
as of december   we have recorded a contingent liability of  for management s estimate of federal and state taxes on an uncertain tax position as to the deductibility of a portion of the payment made for the settlement agreement with the doj 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on uncertain tax positions as part of interest and other expense 
for the year ended december   estimated interest of  was recognized for the uncertain tax positions 
we file income tax returns in the united states  various states  and foreign jurisdictions 
tax years and forward remain open to examination under united states statutes of limitation 
stock based compensation policies and estimates we account for stock based compensation granted to our directors and employees in accordance with guidance issued by the fasb  which requires 
table of contents companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we are required to recognize the compensation cost of the fair value of our stock based compensation granted to employees and directors 
for stock based compensation granted to non employees  we re measure the fair value of stock awards until a measurement date is achieved 
our executive incentive compensation plan provides for issuance of stock based compensation  including the grant of stock  stock appreciation rights  stock options  and other stock based compensation 
under the plan  the exercise price of option awards equals the market price of our stock on the date of grant 
at the discretion of the compensation committee of our board of directors  option awards granted to employees have typically vested in equal increments over a three to five year period starting on the first anniversary of the date of grant 
an option s maximum term is ten years 
the compensation cost that has been charged against income for the incentive compensation plans was million  million  and million and income tax benefit of   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively

for our debt instruments  changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest expense incurred 
the following table sets forth information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates

the functional currency of substantially all of our international subsidiaries is the local currency 
transactions are translated into us dollars and exchange gains and losses arising from translation are recognized in other comprehensive income loss 
fluctuations in exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations 
the majority of our foreign currency exposure is to the euro eur  pound sterling gbp  and japanese yen jpy 
during the year ended december   translation losses were million  which were primarily due to the fluctuation in exchange rates and the weakening of the eur during the last three months of during the year ended december   translation losses were million  which were primarily due to the fluctuation in exchange rates and the weakening of the eur in the first half of in connection with some agreements  we are subject to risk associated with international currency exchange rates on purchases of inventory payable in euros 
at present  we do not hedge our exposure or invest in international currency derivatives 
the us dollar is considered our primary currency  and transactions that are completed in an international currency are translated into us dollars and recorded in the financial statements 
we recognized currency transaction gains of   and  for  and  respectively  primarily due to the effect of our european expansion and the strengthening of the euro as compared to the us dollar 
we do not believe we are currently exposed to any material risk of loss due to exchange rate risk exposure
