overview in  the company continued to migrate to a more commercial profile balance sheet 
the commercial loan portfolio increased million  or  primarily in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans 
the growth in both its loan portfolio and net interest income was offset by additional non interest expenses associated with the first ipswich bancorp acquisition and an increase in professional service fees  including merger related costs  of million after tax associated with the pending acquisition of bancorp rhode island 
basic and fully diluted eps for increased to from in the company s operating income is driven by net interest income  which is driven by the net yield on interest earning assets net interest margin and the quality of the company s assets 
the company s net interest income represents the difference between its interest income and its cost of funds 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the year and the interest rates earned thereon 
cost of funds is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the year and the interest rates paid thereon 
net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin generally exceeds the net interest spread as a portion of interest earning assets are funded by various noninterest bearing sources primarily non interest bearing deposits and shareholders equity 
the increases decreases in the components of interest income and interest expense  expressed in terms of fluctuation in average volume and rate  are summarized in the rate volume analysis table shown on page information as to the components of interest income and interest expense and average rates is provided under results of operations average balances  net interest income  interest rate spread and net interest margins on page the quality of the company s assets can also influence its earnings 
loans that are not being paid on a timely basis and exhibit other weaknesses can result in the loss of principal and or interest income 

table of contents additionally  the company must make timely provisions to its allowance for loan losses based on estimates of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio  these additions  which are charged against earnings  are necessarily greater when greater probable losses are expected 
further  the company will incur expenses as a result of resolving troubled assets 
all of these form the credit risk that the company takes on in the ordinary course of its business and is further discussed under financial condition non performing assets on page from the beginning  the company s business strategy and focus have played a key role in growing the business and differentiating the company from its competitors 
through its full service banks  the company seeks to differentiate itself through building long term relationships with each customer  providing excellent customer service and by having the decision making process done by local management 
the company believes it is important for each bank to be able to make those decisions locally as each marketplace and customer base is different 
the strategic move to a more commercial profile is attractive  among other reasons  because these types of loans have higher yields 
similarly  transaction deposits are attractive because of their generally lower interest cost and because there is potential for fee income 
the competition for loans and deposits remains intense 
in additional to the competition  the economic recovery remains weak and the rate of unemployment high 
while the economy in massachusetts and  in particular  the greater boston metropolitan area has remained relatively stable  unemployment nonetheless rose to levels not seen in over the past thirty years 
the deterioration in the economy made it difficult for some of the company s loan customers to make their loan payments and  as a result  the company experienced loan losses that were higher than historic levels  particularly in its auto and equipment financing portfolios 
while there have been signs recently that the economy has started to gradually improve  the company expects the operating environment in to remain somewhat challenging 
the volume of loan originations and loan losses will depend  to a large extent  on how the economy functions 
loan and deposit growth is also greatly influenced by the rate setting actions of the federal open market committee the fomc of the federal reserve system 
the fomc lowered the rate for overnight federal fund borrowings between banks dramatically from in september to a target range between zero and in december  the rate currently in effect 
in and  the unusually low interest rate environment had a significant effect on deposit flows and yields earned on investments and loans 
rising rates in the future could cause changes in the mix and volume of the company s deposits and make it more difficult for certain borrowers to be eligible for new loans or to service their existing debt 
the future operating results of the company will depend on its ability to maintain net interest margin  while minimizing exposure to credit risk  along with increasing sources of non interest income  while controlling the growth of non interest or operating expenses 
critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are considered critical to understanding the company s financial condition and operating results 
such accounting policies are considered to be especially important because they involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in the company s operating results or financial condition 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
additions to the allowance are made through provisions for loan losses charged to 
table of contents operating earnings 
loan losses are charged off in the period loans  or portions thereof  are deemed uncollectible 
the determination of the loans on which full collectability is not reasonably assured  the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral  and the assessment of economic and other conditions are subject to assumptions and judgments by management 
valuation allowances could differ materially as a result of changes in  or different interpretations of  these assumptions and judgments 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis and reviews its conclusion as to the amount to be established with the executive committee and the audit committee 
the executive committee is comprised of four independent directors of the board of directors and the audit committee is comprised of four other independent directors 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein for additional information on how management determines the balance of the allowance for loan losses for each segment and class of loans 
goodwill impairment goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested at least annually for impairment 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
if fair value exceeds the carrying amount at the time of testing  goodwill is not considered impaired 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are considered to be used as the basis for measurement  when available 
other acceptable valuation methods include present value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues  or similar performance measures 
differences in valuation techniques could result in materially different evaluations of impairment 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update addressing the topic of testing goodwill for impairment 
the objective of the update is to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in the update permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
in reaching its conclusion about whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  an entity should consider the extent to which each of the adverse events or circumstances identified could affect the comparison of a reporting unit s fair value with its carrying amount 
an entity should place more weight on the events and circumstances that most affect a reporting unit s fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets  and may affect its determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the following qualitative factors have been assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill general economic conditions  regulatory environment  share price  real estate values  lending concentrations  interest rate environment  asset quality  capital  financial performance  integration of acquired companies and conversion to a new data processing system 
goodwill impairment testing was performed for the company  eastern funding and first ipswich 
the annual goodwill impairment test of the company was performed as of december  based on an evaluation of the qualitative factors mentioned above and assessing the effect identified adverse events or circumstances could have  the company has concluded there was no indication of goodwill impairment 

table of contents intangible assets identified intangible assets are assets resulting from acquisitions that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the recoverability of goodwill and identified intangible assets is evaluated for impairment at least annually 
if impairment is deemed to have occurred  the amount of impairment is charged to expense when identified 
investment securities securities classified as available for sale are carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
debt securities that the company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
the market values of the company s securities  particularly its fixed rate securities  are affected by changes in market interest rates 
in general  as interest rates rise  the fair value of fixed rate securities will decrease  as interest rates fall  the fair value of fixed rate securities will increase 
on a quarterly basis  the company reviews and evaluates fair value based on market data obtained from independent sources or  in the absence of active market data  from model derived valuations based on market assumptions 
if the company deems any decline to be other than temporary  the amount of impairment loss recorded in earnings for a debt security is the entire difference between the security s cost and its fair value if the company intends to sell the debt security prior to recovery or it is more likely than not that the company will have to sell the debt security prior to recovery 
if  however  the company does not intend to sell the debt security or it concludes that it is more likely than not that the company will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery  the credit loss component of an other than temporary impairment of a debt security is recognized as a charge to earnings and the remaining portion of the impairment loss is recognized as a reduction in comprehensive income 
the credit loss component of an other than temporary loss is determined based on the company s best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected 
impairment losses charged to earnings in  and were   and  respectively 
income taxes certain areas of accounting for income taxes require management s judgment  including determining the expected realization of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
judgments are made regarding various tax positions  which are often subjective and involve assumptions about items that are inherently uncertain 
if actual factors and conditions differ materially from estimates made by management  the actual realization of the net deferred tax assets or liabilities for uncertain tax positions could vary materially from the amounts previously recorded 
deferred tax assets arise from items that may be used as a tax deduction or credit in future income tax returns  for which a financial statement tax benefit has already been recognized 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years taxable income to which refund claims could be carried back 
valuation allowances are recorded against those deferred tax assets determined not likely to be realized 
deferred tax liabilities represent items that will require a future tax payment 
they generally represent tax expense recognized in the company s financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or a deduction taken on the company s tax return but not yet recognized as an expense in the company s financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities are also recognized for certain non cash items such as goodwill

the company also provides financing for construction and development projects  home equity and other consumer loans 
the company relies on community and business contacts as well as referrals from customers  attorneys and other professionals to generate loans 
in addition  existing borrowers are an important source of business since many of them have more than one loan outstanding with the company 
the company s ability to originate loans depends on the strength of the economy  trends in interest rates  customer demands and competition 
it is the company s current policy that the aggregate amount of loans outstanding to any one borrower or related entities may not exceed million unless approved by the executive committee 
table of contents of the board of directors 
at december   one borrower had aggregate loans outstanding of million that were approved by the executive committee of the board of directors 
including that borrower  there were borrowers each with aggregate loans outstanding of million or greater at december  the cumulative total of those loans was million or of loans outstanding in the commercial real estate and commercial loan segments excluding equipment financing loans 
the company has written underwriting policies to control the inherent risks in loan origination 
the policies address approval limits  loan to value ratios  appraisal requirements  debt service coverage ratios  loan concentration limits and other matters relevant to loan underwriting 
commercial real estate loans this segment  which is comprised of commercial real estate  multi family mortgage and construction loans  is the largest segment in the company s loan portfolio and represented of total loans outstanding excluding deferred loan origination costs at december  typically  commercial real estate loans are larger in size and involve a greater degree of risk than owner occupied residential mortgage loans 
loan repayment is usually dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties and the value of the properties securing the loans 
economic conditions can greatly affect cash flows and property values 
a number of factors are considered in originating commercial real estate and multi family mortgage loans 
the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower including credit history  as well as the potential income generation and the value and condition of the underlying property  are evaluated 
when evaluating the qualifications of the borrower  the company considers the financial resources of the borrower  the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower s payment history with the company and other financial institutions 
factors considered in evaluating the underlying property include the net operating income of the mortgaged premises before debt service and depreciation  the debt service coverage ratio the ratio of cash flow before debt service to debt service and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value 
generally  personal guarantees are obtained from commercial real estate loan borrowers 
frequently  commercial real estate and multi family mortgage loans are originated for terms of five to ten years with an amortization period of twenty to twenty five years 
many of the loans are priced at inception on a fixed rate basis generally for periods ranging from two to seven years 
to reduce interest rate risk  occasionally the company partially funds such loans by borrowings from the fhlbb on a fixed rate basis for periods that approximate the fixed rate terms of the loans 
generally  a yield maintenance fee is collected when a fixed rate loan is paid off prior to its maturity 
brookline bank s urban and suburban market area is characterized by a large number of apartment buildings  condominiums and office buildings 
as a result  multi family and commercial real estate mortgage lending has been a significant part of brookline bank s activities for many years 
these types of loans typically generate higher yields  but also involve greater credit risk 
many of brookline bank s borrowers have more than one multi family or commercial real estate loan outstanding with brookline bank 
over of the commercial real estate loans outstanding at december  were secured by properties located in new england 
the commercial real estate portfolio at that date was comprised primarily of loans secured by apartment buildings million  retail stores million  office buildings million  industrial properties million and mixed use properties million 
construction and development financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than long term financing on improved  occupied real estate 
risk of loss on a construction loan is 
table of contents largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of construction costs  the estimated time to sell or rent the completed property at an adequate price or rate of occupancy  and market conditions 
if the estimates and projections prove to be inaccurate  the company may be confronted with a project which  upon completion  has a value that is insufficient to assure full loan repayment 
criteria applied in underwriting construction loans for which the primary source of repayment is the sale of the property are different from the criteria applied in underwriting construction loans for which the primary source of repayment is the stabilized cash flow from the completed project 
for those loans where the primary source of repayment is from resale of the property  in addition to the normal credit analysis performed for other loans  the company also analyzes project costs  the attractiveness of the property in relation to the market in which it is located and demand within the market area 
for those construction loans where the source of repayment is the stabilized cash flow from the completed project  the company analyzes not only project costs but also how long it might take to achieve satisfactory occupancy and the reasonableness of projected rental rates in relation to market rental rates 
historically  construction and development lending has been a modest part of the company s loan originations 
at december   construction loans equaled million  or of total loans outstanding excluding deferred loan origination costs at that date 
commercial loans this segment is comprised of commercial loans  equipment financing loans and condominium association loans and represented of total loans outstanding excluding deferred loan origination costs at december  growth in commercial loans over the past few years has resulted from the hiring of officers with extensive experience in commercial lending 
the company provides commercial banking services to companies in its market area 
product offerings include lines of credit  term loans  letters of credit  deposit services and cash management 
these types of credit facilities have as their primary source of repayment cash flows from the operations of a business 
interest rates offered are available on a floating basis tied to the prime rate or a similar index or on a fixed rate basis referenced on the fhlbb index 
credit extensions are made to established businesses on the basis of an analysis of their financial statements  the nature of collateral to secure the credit extension and  in most instances  the personal guarantee of the owner of the business 
the company also participates in us government programs such as the small business administration the sba in both the a program and as a sba preferred lender 
the equipment financing portfolio is comprised primarily of loans to finance coin operated laundry  dry cleaning and convenience store equipment and businesses 
the borrowers are located primarily in the greater new york new jersey metropolitan area  although the customer base extends to locations throughout the united states of america 
typically  the loans are priced at a fixed rate of interest and require monthly payments over their three to seven year life 
in some instances  the life of a loan can extend to ten years 
eastern funding focuses on making loans to customers with business experience 
an important part of eastern funding s loan originations comes from existing customers as they expand their operations and acquire additional stores 
the size of loan that eastern funding is willing to make is determined by an analysis of cash flow and other characteristics pertaining to the store and equipment to be financed 
eastern funding has developed a base of data of the revenue and profitability of stores it has financed 
it has also accumulated data on the prices at which stores have sold 
eastern funding s loan policy contains limits on the multiples of revenues and earnings that can be applied to derive an estimate of the value of a store to be financed 

table of contents the yields earned on equipment financing loans are higher than those earned on commercial loans made by brookline bank because they involve a higher degree of credit risk 
its customers are typically small business owners who operate with limited financial resources and who are more at risk when the economy weakens or unforeseen adverse events arise 
because of these characteristics  personal guarantees of borrowers are usually obtained along with liens on available assets 
loans to condominium associations are for the purpose of funding capital improvements  are made for five to ten year terms and are secured by a general assignment of condominium association revenues 
among the factors considered in the underwriting of such loans are the level of owner occupancy  the financial condition and history of the condominium association  the attractiveness of the property in relation to the market in which it is located and the reasonableness of estimates of the cost of capital improvements to be made 
depending on loan size  funds are advanced as capital improvements are made and  in more complex situations  after completion of engineering inspections 
auto loans this loan segment represented of total loans outstanding excluding deferred loan origination costs at december  the reduction in auto loans in resulted from lower loan originations as the auto industry experienced lower sales and lenders affiliated with auto manufacturers offered loan terms at low rates which the company chose not to match 
the loans are for the purchase of automobiles both new and used and light duty trucks primarily to individuals  but also to corporations and other organizations 
the loans are originated through dealerships and assigned to the company 
the vice president responsible for auto lending must approve the application of any dealer with whom the company does business 
the company does business with over dealerships located primarily in massachusetts  but also in connecticut  rhode island and new hampshire 
dealer relationships are reviewed periodically for application quality  the ratio of loans approved to applications submitted and loan performance 
loan applications are generated by approved dealers and data are entered into an application processing system 
a credit bureau scorecard model is used in the underwriting process 
the model is based on data accumulated by nationally recognized credit bureaus and is a risk assessment tool that analyzes an individual s credit history and assigns a numeric credit score 
the model meets the requirements of the equal credit opportunity act 
the application processing system statistically grades each application according to score ranges 
depending on the data received  an application is either approved or denied automatically or submitted to a credit underwriter for review 
credit underwriters may override system designated approvals 
loans approved by the underwriters must meet criteria guidelines established in the company s loan policy 
credit profile measurements such as debt to income ratios  payment to income ratios and loan to value ratios are utilized in the underwriting process and to monitor the performance of loans falling within specified ratio ranges 
regarding loan to value ratios  the company considers auto loans to be essentially credits that are less than fully collateralized 
when borrowers cease to make required payments  repossession and sale of the vehicle financed usually results in insufficient funds to fully pay the remaining loan balance 
while the company s auto loan policy permits the aggregate amount of loans with credit scores of less than to comprise as much as of loans outstanding  at december   loans with credit scores below were in fact of loans outstanding 
the average dollar original weighted credit score of loans in the portfolio at that date was see the subsection provision for credit losses appearing elsewhere herein for further information regarding loan underwriting and the average credit scores of the borrowers to whom auto loans were made 
all loans require the purchase of single interest insurance by the borrower 
the insurance is designed to protect the company from 
table of contents loss when a loan is in default and the collateral value is impaired due to vehicle damage or the company is unable to take possession of the vehicle 
auto loans are assigned a particular tier based on the credit score determined by the credit bureau 
the tier is used for pricing purposes only so as to assure consistency in loan pricing 
tier rates can be modified if certain conditions exist as outlined in the company s loan policy 
the rate paid by a borrower usually differs with the buy rate earned by the company 
a significant part of the difference between the two rates is retained by the dealer in accordance with terms agreed to between the dealer and the company 
the difference is commonly referred to as the spread 
most of the spread is paid after the end of the month in which the loan is made and is comprised of the agreed upon rate differential multiplied by the expected average balance of the loan over its scheduled maturity 
if a loan is repaid in entirety within days of the loan origination date  the dealer must pay the remainder of unamortized spread to the company 
if a loan is repaid after days  the dealer is not obliged to repay any part of the spread amount previously received 
spread payments to dealers are amortized as a reduction of interest received from borrowers over the life of the related loans 
when loans are prepaid  any remaining unamortized balance is charged to expense at that time 
in certain instances  a fixed fee is paid to the dealer for each loan originated 
depending on the terms of the dealer s enrollment agreement with the company  the dealer earns a fee in its entirety days after the loan is originated or upon the borrower making at least three payments on the loan 
various reports are generated to monitor receipt of required loan documents  adherence to loan policy parameters  dealer performance  loan delinquencies and loan charge offs 
summary reports are submitted to the chief credit officer  the chief financial officer and the board of directors on a monthly basis 
consumer loans this segment is comprised of residential mortgage loans  home equity loans and other consumer loans and represented of total loans outstanding excluding deferred loan origination costs at december  residential mortgage loans equaled of total loans outstanding at that date 
in and  the company decided to reduce its origination of residential mortgage loans due to aggressive competitor pricing 
the company offers both fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans secured by one to four family residences 
generally  fixed rate residential mortgage loans with maturities beyond ten years are not maintained in the company s loan portfolio 
each residential mortgage loan granted is subject to a satisfactorily completed application  employment verification  credit history and a demonstrated ability to repay the debt 
appraisals are performed by outside independent fee appraisers 
in general  the company follows guidelines established by the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage association fnma 
underwriting guidelines for home equity loans and lines of credit are similar to those for residential mortgage loans 
home equity loans and lines of credit are limited to no more than of the appraised value of the property securing the loan less the amount of any existing first mortgage liens 
other consumer loans at december  equaled of all loans outstanding excluding deferred loan origination costs at that date

table of contents allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is management s estimate of probable known and inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio 
the manner in which the allowance is established is based on judgments  assumptions and estimates that are difficult  complex and subjective 
use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in the company s operating results or financial condition 
accordingly  the policies that govern the company s assessment of the allowance for loan losses are considered critical accounting policies and are discussed under that heading appearing elsewhere herein

restructured loans represent performing loans for which concessions such as reductions of interest rates to below market terms and or extension of repayment terms were granted due to a borrower s financial condition 
at december  and  loans past due days or more and still on accrual amounted to million and million  respectively 
the loans were comprised of commercial real estate loans  multi family mortgage loans and commercial loans that matured and the borrowers continued to make their regular principal and interest payments as if their loans had been renewed when  if fact  the renewals had not yet taken place 
it is expected that the loans will be renewed or paid in full without any loss 
non performing assets include other real estate owned resulting from foreclosures of properties securing mortgage loans or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure  repossessed vehicles resulting from non payment of amounts due under auto loans and repossessed equipment resulting from non payment of amounts due under equipment financing loans 
other real estate owned and repossessed vehicles and equipment are recorded at estimated fair value less costs to sell 

table of contents nonaccrual loans at december  included three multi family mortgage loans  five residential mortgage loans  and two home equity loans 
acquired loans on nonaccrual included one commercial real estate loan  one construction loan  one residential mortgage loan and one home equity loan 
loss exposure related to the loans on nonaccrual is not considered to be significant and has been recognized through the establishment of reserves included in the allowance for loan losses 
however  if the local and regional real estate market does not improve  additions to the allowance for loan losses could become necessary 
the equipment financing and auto loans on nonaccrual are comprised of several loans 
see the subsection provision for credit losses appearing elsewhere herein for information about delinquencies and net charge offs in the equipment financing and auto loan portfolios 
the decline in repossessed vehicles over the past three years was due primarily to improvements in the quality of the auto loan portfolio resulting from application of stricter underwriting criteria commencing in the second half of the increase in repossessed vehicles in was attributable to an increase in borrowers who were unable to make required loan payments and weaker demand for repossessed vehicles at dealer auctions 
the increases in repossessed equipment in and were attributable to a rise in the number of equipment financing borrowers who were unable to make required loan payments 
the decline in repossessed equipment in and resulted from more aggressive collection efforts 
at december   restructured loans included million of equipment financing loans and million of residential mortgage loans  at december   restructured loans included million of equipment financing loans and million of residential mortgage loans 
restructured loans are loans where the maturity date was extended and or interest rates were reduced to drop required monthly payments to more manageable amounts for the borrowers

securities available for sale are utilized as part of the company s asset liability management and may be sold in response to  or in anticipation of  factors such as changes in market conditions and interest rates  changes in security prepayment rates  liquidity concentrations and regulatory capital requirements 
the investment policy of the company  which is reviewed and approved by the board of directors on an annual basis  specifies the types of investments that are acceptable  required investment ratings by at least one nationally recognized rating agency  concentration limits and duration guidelines 
compliance with the investment policy is monitored on a regular basis 

table of contents us government sponsored enterprises debt securities of us government sponsored enterprises gses include obligations issued by fnma  the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac  the government national mortgage association gnma  the federal home loan banks and the federal farm credit bank 
none of those obligations is backed by the full faith and credit of the us government 
in  most of the company s investment purchases were debt securities issued by gses with maturities primarily in the month to month range 
the company concentrated on acquiring debt securities with short maturities to reduce interest rate risk during a period of uncertainty as to the direction of interest rates 
as gses experienced rising losses and capital erosion in  especially fnma and freddie mac  the company decided to stop purchasing debt securities issued by them 
in  the company recommenced the purchase of gse debt securities 
at december   issuers of gse debt securities with an estimated fair value of approximately million had the right to call or prepay the obligations 
municipal obligations and auction rate municipal obligations the company owned only one remaining municipal obligation at december   it was rated aa by a rating firm at that date and matures on august  auction rate municipal obligations are debt securities issued by municipal  county and state entities that are generally repaid from revenue sources such as hospitals  transportation systems  student education loans and property taxes 
the securities are not obligations of the issuing government entity 
the obligations are variable rate securities with long term maturities whose interest rates are set periodically through an auction process 
the auction period typically ranges from seven days to days 
the reduction in the amount invested in such obligations during the last three years resulted from redemptions at par by issuers 
the auction rate obligations owned by the company were rated aaa at the time of acquisition due  in part  to the guarantee of third party insurers who would have to pay the obligations if the issuers failed to pay the obligations when they become due 
in the first quarter  public disclosures indicated that certain third party insurers were experiencing financial difficulties and  therefore  might not be able to meet their contractual obligations 
as a result  auctions failed to attract a sufficient number of investors and created a liquidity problem for those investors who were relying on the obligations to be redeemed at auction 
since then  there has not been an active market for auction rate municipal obligations 
based on an evaluation of market factors  the estimated fair value of the auction rate municipal obligations owned by the company at december  was million  or  less than their face value 
full collection of the obligations is expected because the financial condition of the issuers is sound  none of the issuers has defaulted on scheduled payments  the obligations are rated investment grade and the company has the ability and intent to hold the obligations for a period of time to recover the unrealized losses 
corporate obligations in  the company increased its investment in corporate obligations in order to diversify its investment portfolio and improve the overall yield on investments 
the corporate debt securities owned at december  will mature primarily within one year 
trust preferred securities trust preferred securities pretsls that were acquired several years ago represent investment instruments comprised of a pool of trust preferred securities that are debt obligations issued by a 
table of contents number of financial institutions and insurance companies 
the investment instruments can be segregated into tranches segments that establish priority rights to cash flows from the underlying trust preferred securities 
at december   the company owned two pools of trust preferred securities  pretsl vi and pretsl xxviii ltd 
the book value of pretsl vi was  at december  two of the issuers  representing of the pool were in default and have deferred regularly scheduled interest payments 
due to the lack of an orderly market for this security  based on an analysis of projected cash flows   was charged to earnings in and an additional  was charged to earnings in as of december   the fair value of this security was estimated to be  based on analytical modeling taking into consideration a range of factors normally found in an orderly market 
the unrealized loss of  on this security was not considered to be an other than temporary impairment loss because projected cash flows exceeded the book value of the security 
the book value of pretsl xxviii was  at december  and the estimated fair value based on factors similar to those used to value the security mentioned in the preceding paragraph was  at that date 
the unrealized loss of  was not considered to be an other than temporary impairment loss because the security is rated investment grade  the company has first priority to future cash redemptions and over of the issuers in the pool would have to default before recovery of the company s investment could be in doubt 
none of the issuers comprising the pool represent more than of the entire pool 
eighteen issuers representing approximately of the remaining aggregate investment pool at december  were in default and have deferred regularly scheduled interest payments at that date 
at december   the aggregate book value of other trust preferred securities owned by the company was million and the aggregate market value was million 
the aggregate unrealized loss on these securities of  was not considered to be an other than temporary impairment loss because of the financial soundness and prospects of the issuers and the company s ability and intent to hold the securities for a period of time to recover the unrealized losses 
mortgage securities the company also invests in mortgage related securities  including collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
these securities are considered attractive investments because they a generate positive yields with minimal administrative expense  b impose minimal credit risk as a result of the guarantees usually provided  c can be utilized as collateral for borrowings  d generate cash flows useful for liquidity management and e are qualified thrift investments for purposes of the thrift lender test that the company is obliged to meet for regulatory purposes 
mortgage related securities are created by the pooling of mortgages and the issuance of a security with an interest rate that is less than the average interest rate on the underlying mortgages 
mortgage related securities purchased by the company generally are comprised of a pool of single family mortgages 
the issuers of such securities are generally us government sponsored enterprises such as fnma  freddie mac and gnma who pool and resell participation interests in the form of securities to investors and guarantee the payment of principal and interest to the investors 
investments in mortgage related securities issued and guaranteed by us government sponsored enterprises generally do not entail significant credit risk 
such investments  however  are susceptible to significant interest rate and cash flow risks when actual cash flows from the investments differ from cash flows estimated at the time of purchase 
additionally  the market value of such securities can be affected adversely by market changes in interest rates 
prepayments that are faster than anticipated may shorten the life of a security and result in the accelerated expensing of any premiums paid  thereby reducing the net yield earned on the security 
although prepayments of underlying mortgages depend on many factors  the difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and prevailing 
table of contents mortgage interest rates generally is the most significant determinant of the rate of prepayments 
during periods of declining interest rates  refinancing generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of underlying mortgages and the related security 
such an occurrence can also create reinvestment risk because of the unavailability of other investments with a comparable rate of return in relation to the nature and maturity of the alternative investment 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  prepayments may decline  thereby extending the estimated life of the security and depriving the company of the ability to reinvest cash flows at the higher market rates of interest 
cmos are a type of debt security issued by a special purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgages and mortgage related securities and creates different classes of cmo securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules as well as residual interest with each class possessing different risk characteristics 
the cash flows from the underlying collateral are generally divided into tranches  or classes  whereby tranches have descending priorities with respect to the distribution of principal and interest repayment of the underlying mortgages and mortgage related securities  as opposed to pass through mortgage backed securities where cash flows are distributed pro rata to all security holders 
in contrast to mortgage backed securities from which cash flow is received pro rata by all security holders and hence  prepayment risk is shared  the cash flow from the mortgages or mortgage related securities underlying cmos is paid in accordance with predetermined priority to investors holding various tranches of such securities 
a particular tranche of a cmo may therefore carry prepayment risk that differs from that of both the underlying collateral and other tranches 
generally  the company has invested in the first tranche of cmos 
mortgage securities acquired in and were purchased mostly because of their higher yield in relation to other investment possibilities and their guarantee by the issuing us government sponsored enterprises 
in  million of mortgage backed securities were sold to reduce the company s investment concentration in mortgage backed securities and to use the proceeds to prepay high rate funds borrowed from the fhlbb

deposits historically  deposits have been the company s primary source of funds 
the company offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms 
the company s deposit accounts consist of non interest bearing checking accounts and interest bearing now accounts  savings accounts and money market savings accounts referred to in the aggregate as transaction deposit accounts and certificate of deposit accounts 
the company offers individual retirement accounts iras and other qualified plan accounts 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in money market rates  prevailing interest rates and the relative attractiveness of competing deposit and investment alternatives 
deposits are obtained predominantly from customers in the communities in which the company s banking offices are located 
deposits are also gathered via the internet 
the company relies primarily on competitive pricing of its deposit products  customer service and long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits 
market interest rates and rates offered by competing financial institutions significantly affect the company s ability to attract and retain deposits 

table of contents the following table presents the deposit mix excluding brokered deposits of the company for the year ends indicated

in  transaction deposit accounts increased million  or  and certificates of deposit excluding brokered deposits decreased million  or 
in  transaction deposit accounts increased million  or  and certificates of deposit excluding brokered deposits increased million  or 
the company believes the growth in deposits and the shift in the mix of deposits in and were due in part to expansion of its cash management capabilities  more effort in seeking deposits from existing customer relationships and the desire of certain depositors to place their funds in a stronger capitalized financial institution and in more liquid accounts 
a rise in interest rates could cause a shift from transaction deposit accounts to certificates of deposit accounts with longer maturities 
generally  the rates paid on certificates of deposit are higher than those paid on transaction deposit accounts 
the company obtained million of brokered certificates of deposit in and used the funds primarily to pay off some of the higher rate borrowed funds of eastern funding that were outstanding at the time of the company s acquisition of a controlling interest in eastern funding 
brokered deposits were used as a source of funds because the interest rates payable on those deposits were lower than the interest rates the company would have had to pay if the company had obtained funds from other borrowing sources 
there have been no brokered deposits since the end of

the maximum amount that the fhlbb will advance to member institutions  including the company  fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the fhlbb

contractual obligations a summary of contractual obligations at december  by the expected payment period follows 
payment due by period less than one year one to three years three to five years over five years total in thousands borrowed funds from the fhlbb loan commitments occupancy lease commitments service provider contracts retirement benefit obligations these amounts represent commitments made by the company to extend credit to borrowers as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 

table of contents the leases contain escalation clauses for real estate taxes and other expenditures 
payments to service providers under most of the existing contracts are based on the volume of accounts served or transactions processed 
some contracts also call for higher required payments when there are increases in the consumer price index 
the expected payments shown in this table are based on an estimate of the number of accounts to be served or transactions to be processed  but do not include any projection of the effect of changes in the consumer price index 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is defined as the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
the company further defines liquidity as the ability to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers  as well as to earnings enhancement opportunities  in a changing marketplace 
the company s primary sources of funds are deposit inflows  principal and interest payments on loans and debt securities  sales of securities from the available for sale portfolio and borrowings from the fhlbb 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investments are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage loan prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rate trends  economic conditions and competition 
based on its monitoring of historic deposit trends and its current pricing strategy for deposits  management believes the company will retain a large portion of its existing deposit base 
while deposits grew significantly in and  growth in will depend on several factors  including the strength of the economy  the interest rate environment and competitor pricing 
the company utilizes advances from the fhlbb to fund growth and to manage part of the interest rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities 
generally  borrowings from the fhlbb result in more interest expense than would be incurred if growth was funded solely by deposits 
advances outstanding from the fhlbb increased to million at the end of as compared to million at the end of due to the inclusion of million in fhlbb advances from the first ipswich bancorp acquisition 
fhlbb advances decreased from million at the end of and million at the end of as the company used part of its deposit growth and proceeds from the sale of mortgage backed securities to pay off borrowings 
at december   the company had a combined capacity to borrow up to an additional million in from the fhlbb and frb 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and due from banks  short term investments and debt securities that generally mature within days 
at december   such assets amounted to million  or of total assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates 
since net interest income is the company s primary source of revenue  interest rate risk is the most significant non credit related market risk to which the company is exposed 
the company s asset liability committee  comprised of several members of senior management  is responsible for managing interest rate risk in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors regarding acceptable levels of interest rate risk  liquidity and capital 
the committee reviews with the board of directors on a quarterly basis its activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the company s operating results  the company s interest rate risk position and the effect subsequent changes in interest rates could have on the company s future net interest income 
the committee is involved in the planning process as well as in the monitoring of pricing for the company s loan and deposit products 

table of contents the committee manages interest rate risk through a variety of methods  including the use of both earnings simulation and gap analysis 
earnings simulation is based on actual cash flows and assumptions of management about future changes in interest rates over both short term and long term horizons  including levels of activity loan originations  loan prepayments and deposit flows 
the assumptions are inherently uncertain and  therefore  actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and strategies 
the net interest income projection resulting from use of actual cash flows and management s assumptions base case is compared to net interest income projections based on an immediate shift of basis points upward and only basis points downward due to current interest rate environment in the first year of the model interest rate shock 
the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income over a one year period under scenarios of a basis points change upward or basis point downward as a percentage of base case earnings projections 
changes in interest rates basis points estimated percentage change in future net interest income over one year over one year base case over one year the company s interest rate risk policy states that an immediate basis points change upward or downward should not negatively impact estimated net interest income over a one year period by more than 
the results shown above are based on the assumption that there are no significant changes in the company s operating environment and that short term interest rates will remain at current levels for all of further  in the case of the basis points downward adjustment  it was assumed that it would not be possible to reduce the rates paid on certain deposit accounts by basis points 
instead  it was assumed that now and savings accounts would remain at current levels  money markets would be reduced by to basis points and certificates of deposit would be reduced by to basis points 
there can be no assurance that the assumptions used will be validated in gap analysis measures the difference between the assets and liabilities repricing or maturing within specific time periods 
an asset sensitive position indicates that there are more rate sensitive assets than rate sensitive liabilities repricing or maturing within specific time horizons  which would generally imply a favorable impact on net interest income in periods of rising interest rates and a negative impact in periods of falling rates 
a liability sensitive position would generally imply a negative impact on net interest income in periods of rising rates and a positive impact in periods of falling rates 
gap analysis has limitations because it cannot measure the effect of interest rate movements and competitive pressures on the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
generally  it is the company s policy to reasonably match the rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time period

debt securities include all debt securities 
unrealized gains and losses on securities  all other marketable equity securities and restricted equity securities are excluded 
for purposes of the gap analysis  the allowance for loan losses  deferred loan origination costs and fair value adjustments are excluded 
interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rates paid on now accounts  savings accounts and money market savings accounts are subject to change at any time and such deposits are immediately withdrawable 
a review of rates paid on these deposit categories over the last several years indicated that the amount and timing of rate changes did not coincide with the amount and timing of rate changes on other deposits when the frb adjusted its benchmark federal funds rate 
because of this lack of correlation and the unlikelihood that such deposits would be withdrawn immediately  the company allocates money market savings accounts between the one year or less and the more than one year to two years columns and now 
table of contents accounts and savings accounts equally over those two columns and the more than two years to three years column in its gap position table 
at december   interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year amounted to billion and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year amounted to billion  resulting in a cumulative one year negative gap position of million  or of total assets 
at december   the company had a cumulative one year negative gap position of million  or of total assets 
the change in the cumulative one year gap position from the end of resulted primarily from the increase of money market savings accounts due to historically low interest rates and the shortening of maturities of borrowings from the fhlbb  as the company replaces them with core deposits 
the company s cumulative positive interest sensitivity gap of assets and liabilities with expected maturities of more than three years changed from approximately million  or  of total assets at december  to million  or  of total assets at december  other market risks included in the company s investment portfolio at december  were marketable equity securities with a market value of  that amount includes net unrealized gains of  movements in the market price of securities may affect the amount of gains or losses ultimately realized by the company from the sale of its equity securities
