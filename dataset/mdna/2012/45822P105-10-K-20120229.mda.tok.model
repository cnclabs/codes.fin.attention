regulated natural gas utility operations our regulated natural gas utilities provide service to approximately  residential  commercial and industrial  transportation  and other customers 
our customers are located in chicago and the northern suburbs of chicago  northeastern wisconsin and an adjacent portion of michigan s upper peninsula  various cities and communities throughout minnesota  and the southern portion of lower michigan 
facilities for information regarding our regulated natural gas facilities  see item  properties 
for our utility plant asset book value  see note  property  plant  and equipment 
natural gas supply our regulated natural gas utilities manage portfolios of natural gas supply contracts  storage services  and pipeline transportation services designed to meet varying customer use patterns at the lowest reasonable cost 
our regulated natural gas supply requirements are met through a combination of fixed price purchases  index price purchases  contracted and owned storage  peak shaving facilities  and natural gas supply call options 
our regulated natural gas subsidiaries contract for fixed term firm natural gas supply each year in the united states and canada to meet the demand of firm system sales customers 
to supplement natural gas supply and manage risk  our regulated natural gas utilities purchase additional natural gas supply on the monthly and daily spot markets 
for more information on our regulated natural gas utility supply and transportation contracts  see note  commitments and contingencies 
our regulated natural gas utilities own two storage fields and contract with various underground storage service providers for additional storage services 
storage allows us to manage significant changes in daily natural gas demand and to purchase steady levels of natural gas on a year round basis  thus providing a hedge against supply cost volatility 
our regulated natural gas utilities contract with local distribution companies and interstate pipelines to purchase firm transportation services 
we believe that having multiple pipelines that serve our regulated natural gas service territory benefits our customers by improving reliability  providing access to a diverse supply of natural gas  and fostering competition among these service providers which can lead to favorable conditions when negotiating new agreements for transportation and storage services 
in addition  our regulated natural gas utilities use financial instruments such as commodity futures  swaps  and options as part of their hedging program to further reduce supply cost volatility 
pgl owns and operates an underground natural gas storage reservoir in central illinois manlove field and a natural gas pipeline system that connects manlove field to chicago with eight major interstate pipelines 
these assets are directed primarily to serving rate regulated retail customers and are included in pgl s regulatory rate base 
pgl also uses a portion of these storage and pipeline assets as a natural gas hub  which consists of providing transportation and storage services in interstate commerce to its wholesale customers 
customers deliver natural gas to pgl through an injection  and pgl later returns the natural gas to the customers when needed through a withdrawal 
title to the natural gas does not transfer to pgl  therefore  all natural gas related only to the hub remains customer owned 
pgl recognizes service fees associated with the natural gas hub services provided to wholesale customers 
these service fees reduce the cost of natural gas and services charged to retail customers in rates 
set forth below is a rollforward of natural gas in storage balances related to the natural gas hub as well as natural gas hub service fees collected from wholesale customers thousands of dekatherms mdth beginning balance  january injections withdrawals ending balance  december millions natural gas hub service fees 
table of contents our regulated natural gas utilities had adequate capacity to meet all firm natural gas demand obligations during and expect to have adequate capacity to meet all firm obligations during our regulated natural gas utilities forecast design peak day throughput is  mdth for the through heating season 
the sources of our deliveries to customers including transportation customers in mdth for regulated natural gas utility operations were as follows mdth natural gas purchases natural gas purchases for electric generation customer owned natural gas received underground storage  net hub fuel in kind liquefied petroleum gas propane owned storage cushion injection contracted pipeline and storage compressor fuel  franchise requirements  and unaccounted for natural gas total this delivered natural gas was originally provided by hub customers whose contract requires them to provide additional natural gas to compensate for unaccounted for natural gas in future deliveries 
regulatory matters our regulated natural gas utility retail rates are regulated by the icc  pscw  mpsc  and mpuc 
these commissions have general supervisory and regulatory powers over public utilities in their respective jurisdictions 
sales are made and services are rendered by the regulated natural gas utilities pursuant to rate schedules on file with the respective commissions 
these rate schedules contain various service classifications  which largely reflect customers different uses and levels of consumption 
our regulated natural gas utilities bill customers for the distribution of natural gas as well as for a natural gas charge representing third party costs for purchasing  transporting  and storing natural gas 
this charge also includes gains  losses  and costs incurred under hedging programs  the amount of which is also subject to applicable commission authority 
prudently incurred natural gas costs are passed directly through to customers in rates and  therefore  have no impact on margins 
commissions in respective jurisdictions conduct annual proceedings regarding the reconciliation of revenues from the natural gas charge and related natural gas costs 
almost all of the natural gas our regulated natural gas utilities distribute is transported to our distribution systems by interstate pipelines 
the pipelines transportation and storage services  including pgl s natural gas hub  are regulated by the ferc under the natural gas act and the natural gas policy act of under united states department of transportation regulations  the state commissions are responsible for monitoring our regulated natural gas utilities safety compliance programs for our pipelines under code of federal regulations cfr part transportation of natural and other gas by pipeline minimum federal safety standards and cfr part transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline 
all of our regulated natural gas utility subsidiaries are required to provide service and grant credit with applicable deposit requirements to customers within their service territories 
our regulated natural gas utilities are generally not allowed to discontinue service during winter moratorium months to residential customers who do not pay their bills 
federal and certain state governments have legislation that provides for a limited amount of funding for assistance to low income customers of the utilities 
see note  regulatory environment  for information regarding rate cases  decoupling mechanisms  and bad debt recovery mechanisms in place at the regulated natural gas utilities 
other matters seasonality the natural gas throughput of our regulated natural gas utilities is generally higher during the winter months because the heating requirements of customers are temperature driven 
during  the regulated natural gas utility segment recorded approximately of its revenues in january  february  march  november  and december 

table of contents competition although our natural gas retail rates are regulated by various commissions  the utilities still face competition from other entities and forms of energy in varying degrees  particularly for large commercial and industrial customers who have the ability to switch between natural gas and alternate fuels 
due to the volatility of energy commodity prices  our regulated natural gas utilities have seen customers with dual fuel capability switch to alternate fuels for short periods of time  then switch back to natural gas as market rates change 
our regulated natural gas utilities offer natural gas transportation service and interruptible natural gas sales to enable customers to better manage their energy costs 
such transportation customers purchase natural gas directly from third party natural gas suppliers and use our regulated natural gas utilities distribution systems to transport the natural gas to their facilities 
our regulated natural gas utilities still earn a distribution charge for transporting the natural gas for these customers 
as such  the loss of revenue associated with the cost of natural gas our transportation customers now purchase from the third party suppliers has no impact on our regulated natural gas utilities segment net income  as it is offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs 
additionally  some customers have elected to purchase their natural gas directly from one of our regulated natural gas utilities on an interruptible basis  as a means to reduce their costs 
customers continue to switch between firm system supply  interruptible system supply  and transportation service each year as the economics and service options change 
working capital requirements the working capital needs of our regulated natural gas utility operations vary significantly over time due to volatility in levels of natural gas inventories and the price of natural gas 
our regulated natural gas utilities working capital needs are met by cash generated from operations and debt both long term and short term 
the seasonality of natural gas revenues causes the timing of cash collections to be concentrated from january through june 
a portion of the winter natural gas supply needs is typically purchased and stored from april through november 
also  planned capital spending on the regulated natural gas distribution facilities is concentrated in april through november 
because of these timing differences  the cash flow from customers is typically supplemented with temporary increases in short term borrowings from affiliates and external sources during the late summer and fall 
short term debt is typically reduced over the january through june period

regulated electric utility operations our regulated electric utility operations of wps and uppco provide service to approximately  residential  commercial and industrial  wholesale  and other customers 
wps s customers are located in northeastern wisconsin and an adjacent portion of michigan s upper peninsula 
uppco s customers are located in michigan s upper peninsula 
wholesale electric service is provided to various customers  including municipal utilities  electric cooperatives  energy marketers  other investor owned utilities  and municipal joint action agencies 
beginning in  uppco no longer provides service to any wholesale electric customers due to the expiration of its remaining wholesale electric contracts in in  retail electric revenues accounted for of total electric revenues  while wholesale electric revenues accounted for of total electric revenues 
in  wps reached a firm net design peak of  megawatts mw on july at the time of this summer peak  wps s total firm resources ie  generation plus firm purchases totaled  mw 
the summer period is the most relevant for wps s regulated electric utility capacity due to the air conditioning requirements of its customers 
the pscw requires wps to maintain a planning reserve margin above its projected annual peak demand forecast to help ensure reliability of electric service to its customers 
the pscw has a reserve margin requirement for long term planning planning years two through ten 
for short term planning planning year one  the pscw requires wisconsin utilities to follow the planning reserve margin established by miso under module e of its open access transmission and energy markets tariff 
miso has a reserve margin requirement from january through may   and for the remainder of the mpsc does not have minimum guidelines for future supply reserves 
in  uppco reached a firm net design peak of mw on february at the time of this peak  uppco s total firm resources totaled mw 
the mpsc does not have minimum guidelines for future supply reserves  however  the miso short term planning reserve margin requirements described above also apply to uppco 
wps and uppco expect future supply reserves to meet the minimum planning reserve margin requirements for wps and uppco had adequate capacity through company owned generation units and power purchase contracts to meet all firm electric demand obligations during and expect to have adequate capacity to meet all obligations during facilities for a complete list of our electric utility facilities  see item  properties 
for our utility plant asset book value  see note  property  plant  and equipment 

table of contents electric supply both wps and uppco are members of miso  a ferc approved  independent  non profit organization  which operates a financial and physical electric wholesale market in the midwest 
wps and uppco offer their generation and bid their customer load into the miso market 
miso evaluates wps s  uppco s  and other market participants energy offers into  and subsequent withdrawals from  the system to economically dispatch electricity within the system 
miso settles the participants offers and bids based on locational marginal prices  which are market driven values based on the specific time and location of the purchase and or sale of energy 
electric generation and supply mix the sources of our electric utility supply were as follows millions energy source kilowatt hours company owned generation units coal hydroelectric wind natural gas  fuel oil  and tire derived total company owned generation units power purchase contracts nuclear kewaunee power station natural gas fox energy center  llc and combined locks energy center  llc hydroelectric wind other total power purchase contracts purchased power from miso purchased power from other total purchased power opportunity sales sales to miso net sales to other total opportunity sales total electric utility supply fuel costs the cost of fuel per generation of one million british thermal units was as follows fuel type coal natural gas fuel oil coal supply coal is the primary fuel source for wps s electric generation facilities 
wps s regulated fuel portfolio strategy is to maintain a to day supply of coal at each plant site 
currently the coal supply is higher than the portfolio strategy due to lower coal burning rates as a result of decreased natural gas prices and economic conditions 
the majority of the coal is purchased from powder river basin mines located in wyoming 
this low sulfur coal has been wps s lowest cost coal source of any of the subbituminous coal producing regions in the united states 
historically  wps has purchased coal directly from the producer for its wholly owned plants 
wps also purchases the coal for the jointly owned weston plant and dairyland power cooperative reimburses wps for their share of the coal costs 
wisconsin power and light purchases coal for the jointly owned edgewater and columbia plants and is reimbursed by wps for its share of the coal costs 
at december   wps had coal transportation contracts in place for of its coal transportation requirements 
for more information on coal purchases and coal deliveries under contract  see note  commitments and contingencies 

table of contents power purchase agreements our electric utilities enter into short term and long term power purchase agreements to meet a portion of their electric energy supply needs 
for more information on power purchase obligations  see note  commitments and contingencies 
regulatory matters wps s retail electric rates are regulated by the pscw and the mpsc 
uppco s retail electric rates are regulated by the mpsc 
the ferc regulates wholesale electric rates for wps and uppco 
wps and uppco must also comply with mandatory electric system reliability standards developed by the north american electric reliability corporation nerc  the electric reliability organization certified by the ferc 
the midwest reliability organization is responsible for the enforcement of nerc s standards for wps and uppco 
the pscw sets rates through its ratemaking process  which is based on recovery of operating costs and a return on invested capital 
one of the cost recovery components is fuel and purchased power  which is governed by a fuel window mechanism  as described in note f  summary of significant accounting policies revenues and customer receivables 
the mpsc and the ferc ratemaking processes are similar to those of the pscw  with the exception of fuel and purchased power  which are recovered on a one for one basis 
see note  regulatory environment  for information regarding rate cases and decoupling mechanisms of our electric utilities 
hydroelectric licenses wps  uppco  and wrpc a company in which wps has ownership have long term licenses from the ferc for their hydroelectric facilities 
other matters seasonality our electric utility sales in wisconsin are generally higher during the summer months due to the air conditioning requirements of customers 
our regulated electric utility sales in michigan do not follow a significant seasonal trend due to cooler climate conditions in the upper peninsula of michigan 
competition the retail electric utility market in wisconsin is regulated by the pscw 
retail electric customers currently do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier 
in order to increase sales  utilities work to attract new customers into their service territories 
as a result  there is competition among utilities to keep energy rates low 
wisconsin utilities have continued to refine regulated tariffs in order to pass on the true cost of electricity to each class of customer by reducing or eliminating rate subsidies among different ratepayer classes 
although wisconsin electric energy markets are regulated  utilities still face competition from other energy sources  such as self generation by large industrial customers and alternative energy sources 
michigan electric energy markets are open to competition 
however  an active competitive market has not yet developed in the upper peninsula of michigan  primarily due to a lack of excess generation and transmission system capacity

energy supply physical supply obligations are created when integrys energy services executes forward retail customer sales contracts 
integrys energy services electricity supply requirements are primarily met through bilateral electricity purchase agreements with generation companies and other marketers  as well as purchases from regional power pools 
integrys energy services does not own any natural gas reserves  so all natural gas supply is procured from producers and other suppliers in the wholesale market 
natural gas is sourced at the customer demand regions  or from the supply region and transported to the customer demand regions under natural gas transportation contracts 
facilities for information regarding the energy asset facilities owned by integrys energy services  see item  properties 
for our nonregulated plant asset book value  see note  property  plant  and equipment 
fuel supply for generation facilities integrys energy services fuel inventory policy varies for each generation facility depending on the type of fuel used 
the natural gas fired facilities of its installed generation portfolio are subject to market price volatility  and are dispatched to produce energy only when it is economical to do so 
the westwood facility of its installed generation portfolio burns waste coal left behind by mining operations and has several years supply on site 
all fuel is located within a seven mile radius of the facility 
the renewable energy facilities of its installed generation portfolio are all powered by renewable resources such as solar irradiance or landfill gas 
there is no market price risk associated with the fuel supply of these facilities  however  production at these facilities can be intermittent due to the availability of the renewable energy resource 
regulatory matters integrys energy services is a ferc authorized power marketer and has all of the licenses required to conduct business in the states in which it operates 
other matters customer segmentation as of december   integrys energy services largest retail electric markets included the illinois  new york  new england  mid atlantic  and michigan regions 
integrys energy services largest retail natural gas markets included wisconsin  illinois  ohio  and michigan 
integrys energy services continuously reviews and evaluates the profitability of its operations in each of its markets 
integrys energy services continues to concentrate on adding customers in existing markets and placing emphasis on business that provides the appropriate rate of return  and currently has no plans to expand into new geographic regions 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction  for a discussion of the current strategy for integrys energy services 
integrys energy services is not dependent on any one customer segment 
rather  a significant percentage of its retail sales volume is derived from several industries  including paper and allied products  general government and national security  food and kindred products  schools including primary  secondary  colleges  and universities  chemicals and paint  and steel and foundries 

table of contents seasonality integrys energy services business  in the aggregate  is somewhat seasonal with certain products selling more heavily in certain seasons than in others 
sales of natural gas generally peak in the winter months  while sales of electricity generally peak in the summer months  with the first and fourth quarters  in the aggregate  typically being the most profitable periods 
integrys energy services business can be volatile as a result of market conditions and the related market opportunities available to its customers 
competition integrys energy services is a nonregulated retail energy marketer that competes against regulated utilities and other retail energy marketers 
integrys energy services competes with other energy providers on the basis of price  reliability  customer service  product offerings  financial strength  consumer convenience  performance  and reputation 
the competitive landscape differs in each regional area and within each targeted customer segment 
for residential and small commercial customers  the primary competitive challenges come from the incumbent utility  established national marketers  and affiliated utility marketing companies 
the large commercial  institutional  and industrial segments are very competitive in most markets with nearly all natural gas customers having already switched away from utilities to an alternative energy provider 
national affiliated marketers  energy producers  and other independent retail energy companies compete for customers in this segment 
the local utilities generally have the advantage of long standing relationships with their customers  and they have longer operating histories  greater financial and other resources  and greater name recognition in their markets than integrys energy services 
in addition  local utilities have been subject to many years of regulatory oversight and  thus  have a significant amount of experience regarding the policy preferences of their regulators 
local utilities may seek to decrease their tariff retail rates to limit or preclude opportunities for competitive energy suppliers and may seek to establish rates  terms  and conditions to the disadvantage of competitive energy suppliers 
working capital the working capital needs of integrys energy services vary significantly over time due to volatility in commodity prices and related margin calls  and levels of natural gas storage inventories 
integrys energy services working capital needs are met by cash generated from operations  equity infusions  and debt both long term and short term 
as of december   integrys energy services had the ability to borrow up to million through an intercompany credit facility with us

table of contents item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors  as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  when making an investment decision 
we are subject to government regulation  which may have a negative impact on our businesses  financial position  and results of operations 
we are subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal and state regulatory agencies and local governmental bodies 
this regulation significantly influences our operating environment and may affect our ability to recover costs from customers of our regulated operations 
many aspects of our operations are regulated  including  but not limited to  construction and operation of facilities  conditions of service  the issuance of securities  and the rates that we can charge customers 
we are required to have numerous permits  approvals  and certificates from these agencies to operate our business 
failure to comply with any applicable rules or regulations may lead to penalties or customer refunds  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
existing statutes and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted by federal and state regulatory agencies  or these agencies may adopt new laws and regulations that apply to us 
we are unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results of any such actions by these agencies 
however  changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations may require us to incur additional expenses or change business operations  which may have an adverse impact on results of operations 
the rates  including adjustments determined under riders  which our regulated utilities are allowed to charge for their retail and wholesale services are the most important factors influencing our business  financial position  results of operations  and liquidity 
rate regulation is premised on providing an opportunity to recover prudently incurred costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital 
however  there is no assurance that regulatory commissions will consider all the costs of the regulated utilities to have been prudently incurred 
in addition  the regulatory process will not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of such costs or provide for a reasonable return on equity 
certain expense and revenue items are deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers  as authorized by regulators 
future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured  and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for prudence and reasonableness 
if recovery of costs is not approved or is no longer deemed probable  regulatory assets would be recognized in current period expense and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
we are subject to environmental laws and regulations  compliance with which could be difficult and costly 
we are subject to numerous federal and state environmental laws and regulations that affect many aspects of our operations  including future operations 
these laws and regulations relate to air emissions  water quality  wastewater discharges  and the generation  transport  and disposal of solid wastes and hazardous substances 
these laws and regulations require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations  licenses  permits  inspections  and other approvals 
environmental laws and regulations can also require us to restrict or limit the output of certain facilities or the use of certain fuels  install pollution control equipment or environmental monitoring equipment at our facilities  incur fees for emissions and permits  and incur expenditures for cleanup costs  damages arising from contaminated properties  and monitoring obligations 
in addition  there is uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 
compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations may result in increased capital  operating  and other costs  and non compliance could result in fines  penalties  and injunctive measures affecting our facilities 
existing environmental laws or regulations may also be revised and or new laws or regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to us 
these laws and regulations include  but are not limited to  regulation regarding mercury  sulfur dioxide  and nitrogen oxide emissions  and the management of coal combustion byproducts  including fly ash 
the steps we could be required to take to ensure that our facilities are in compliance with any such laws and regulations could be prohibitively expensive 
as a result  certain coal fired electric generating facilities may become uneconomical to run and could result in early retirement of some of our units or may force us to convert the units to an alternative type of fuel 
costs associated with these potential actions could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our natural gas utility subsidiaries are accruing liabilities and deferring costs recorded as regulatory assets incurred in connection with their former manufactured gas plant sites 
these costs include all recoverable costs incurred to date  management s best estimates of future costs for investigation and remediation  and legal expenses  and are net of amounts recovered by or that may be recovered from insurance or other entities 
the ultimate costs to remediate these sites could also vary from the amounts currently accrued 
citizen groups that feel environmental regulations are not being sufficiently enforced by environmental regulatory agencies may also bring citizen enforcement actions against us 
such actions could seek penalties  injunctive relief  and costs of litigation 
there is also a risk that private citizens may bring lawsuits to recover environmental damages they believe they have incurred 

table of contents we may incur significant costs if laws or regulations are adopted to address climate change 
political interest in climate change and the effects of greenhouse gas emissions  most notably carbon dioxide  are a concern for the energy industry 
although no legislation is currently pending that would affect us  state or federal legislation could be passed in the future to regulate greenhouse gas emissions 
in addition  the epa has adopted regulations under the clean air act caa that apply to permitting new or significantly modified facilities 
the epa also announced its intent to develop new source performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions 
the standards would apply to new and modified  as well as existing  electric utility steam generating units 
until legislation is passed at the federal or state level or the epa adopts final rules for electric utility steam generating units  it remains unclear as to which industry sectors will be impacted  when compliance will be required  the magnitude of the greenhouse gas emissions reductions that will be required  and the costs and opportunities associated with compliance 
it is possible that future carbon regulation will increase the cost of electricity produced at coal fired generation units 
future regulation may also affect the capital expenditures we would make at our generation units  including costs to further limit the greenhouse gas emissions from our operations through carbon capture and storage technology 
any such regulation may also create substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances and could also affect the availability or cost of fossil fuels 
future legislation designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could make some generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate and could impact future results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition if such costs are not recoverable through regulated rates 
our natural gas delivery systems may generate fugitive gas as a result of normal operations and as a result of excavation  construction  and repair of natural gas delivery systems 
fugitive gas typically vents to the atmosphere and consists primarily of methane  a greenhouse gas 
carbon dioxide is also a byproduct of natural gas consumption 
as a result  future legislation to regulate greenhouse gas emissions could increase the price of natural gas  restrict the use of natural gas  adversely affect our ability to operate our natural gas facilities  and or reduce natural gas demand  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our operations are subject to various conditions which can result in fluctuations in the number of customers and their usage 
our operations are affected by the demand for electricity and natural gas  which can vary greatly based upon fluctuations in general economic conditions and growth in the service areas in which we operate  weather conditions and seasonality  the amount of energy available from current or new competitors  and our customers continued focus on energy efficiency 
our operations are subject to risks arising from the reliability of our power plants and distribution system  as well as the reliability of third party transmission providers 
the operation of electric generation and natural gas and electric distribution facilities involves many risks  including the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  which may occur due to storms  natural disasters  or other catastrophic events 
other risks include aging infrastructure  fuel supply or transportation disruptions  accidents  employee labor disputes  construction delays or cost overruns  shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment  material and labor  and performance below expected levels 
because our electric generation facilities are interconnected with third party transmission facilities  the operation of our facilities could also be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of these third parties 
operation of our power plants below expected capacity could result in lost revenues and increased expenses  including higher operating and maintenance costs  purchased power costs  and capital requirements 
unplanned outages of generating units and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems may occur and are an inherent risk of our business 
unplanned outages may reduce our revenues or may require us to incur significant costs as a result of selling less electric energy  including having to operate our higher cost electric generators or obtaining replacement power from third parties in the open market to satisfy our power sales obligations 
insurance  warranties  performance guarantees  or recovery through the regulatory process may not cover any or all of the lost revenues or increased expenses 
new and pending environmental regulations may force many generation facility owners in the midwest  including our electric utilities  to retire a significant number of older coal fired generation facilities  resulting in a potential reduction in the region s capacity reserve margin to below acceptable risk levels 
this could also impair the reliability of the midwest portion of the grid  especially during peak demand periods 
a reduction in available future capacity could also adversely affect our ability to serve our customers needs 
we are obligated to provide safe and reliable service to customers within our service territories 
meeting this commitment requires significant capital resources 
failure to provide safe and reliable service and failure to meet regulatory reliability standards could adversely affect our operating results through the imposition of penalties and fines or other adverse regulatory outcomes 

table of contents our operations are subject to risks beyond our control  including but not limited to  cyber security attacks  terrorist attacks  acts of war  or loss of personally identifiable information 
any future terrorist attack  cyber security attack  and or act of war affecting our facilities and operations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the energy industry uses sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure  which control an interconnected system of generation  distribution  and transmission systems with other third parties 
a cyber security attack may occur despite our security measures or those that we require our vendors to take  including compliance with reliability standards and critical infrastructure protection standards 
cyber security attacks  including those targeting information systems and electronic control systems used at generating facilities and electric and natural gas transmission  distribution  and storage systems  could severely disrupt our operations and result in loss of service to customers 
the risk of such attacks may also increase our capital and operating costs as a result of having to implement increased security measures for protection of our information technology and infrastructure 
the cost of repairing damage to our facilities or for legal claims caused by these attacks may not be recoverable in rates or may exceed the insurance limits on our insurance policies or  in some cases  may not be covered by insurance 
the high cost or potential unavailability of insurance to cover terrorist activity may also adversely impact our results of operations and financial conditions 
our business requires the collection and retention of personally identifiable information of our customers  shareholders  and employees  who expect that we will adequately protect such information 
a significant theft  loss  or fraudulent use of personally identifiable information may cause our business reputation to be adversely impacted  may lead to potentially large costs to notify and protect the impacted persons  and or may cause us to become subject to legal claims  fines  or penalties  any of which could adversely impact our results of operations 
counterparties and customers may not meet their obligations 
we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to various arrangements who owe us money  electricity  natural gas  coal  or other commodities or services will not be able to perform their obligations 
should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform  we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at then current market prices or we may be unable to meet all of our customers natural gas and electric requirements unless or until alternative supply arrangements are put in place 
in such event  we may incur losses  or our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected 
some of our customers are experiencing  or may experience  financial problems that could have a significant impact on their creditworthiness 
we cannot provide assurance that financially distressed customers will not default on their obligations to us and that such defaults will not have a material adverse impact on our business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
furthermore  the bankruptcy of one or more of our customers  or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint  could adversely impact our receivable collections or increase our bad debt allowances for these customers  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  such events might force customers to reduce their future use of our products and services  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
any change in our ability to sell electricity generated from our facilities at market based rates may impact earnings 
the ferc has authorized certain of our subsidiaries to sell generation from their facilities at market prices 
the ferc retains the authority to modify or withdraw this market based rate authority 
if the ferc determines that the market is not workably competitive  that we or our subsidiaries possess market power  that we are not charging just and reasonable rates  or that we have not complied with the rules required in order to maintain market based rates  the ferc may require our subsidiaries to sell power at a price based upon the costs incurred in producing the power 
our revenues and profit margins may be negatively affected by any reduction by the ferc of the rates we may receive 
poor investment performance of retirement plan investments and other factors impacting retirement plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations 
we have employee benefit plans that cover substantially all of our employees and retirees 
our cost of providing these benefit plans is dependent upon actual plan experience and assumptions concerning the future 
these assumptions include earnings on and or valuations of plan assets  discount rates  the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans  future government regulation  estimated withdrawals by retirees  and required or voluntary contributions to the plans 
depending on the investment performance over time and other factors impacting our costs  we could be required to make larger contributions in the future to fund these plans 
these additional funding obligations could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows  financial condition  and or results of operations 
changes made to the plans may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs 

table of contents as a holding company  we rely on the earnings of our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations 
we are a holding company  and our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets 
substantially all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries 
consequently  our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us  whether through dividends or otherwise 
our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any of our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose or for the payment of dividends on our common stock 
the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us depends on their earnings  cash flows  capital requirements  general financial condition  and regulatory limitations 
in addition  each subsidiary s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any statutory and or contractual restrictions  which may include requirements to maintain levels of debt or equity ratios  working capital  or other assets 
our utility subsidiaries are regulated by various state utility commissions  which generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met 
we may not be able to use tax credit and or net operating loss carryforwards 
we have significantly reduced our consolidated federal and state income tax liability in the past through tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards available under the applicable tax codes 
we have not fully used these tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards in our previous tax filings  and we may not be able to fully use the tax credits and net operating losses available as carryforwards if our future federal and state taxable income and related income tax liability is insufficient to permit the use of such credits and losses 
in addition  any future disallowance of some or all of those tax credits or net operating loss carryforwards as a result of legislative change or adverse determination by one of the applicable taxing jurisdictions could materially affect our tax obligations and financial results 
adverse capital and credit market conditions could negatively affect our ability to meet liquidity needs  access capital  and or grow or sustain our current business 
cost of capital and disruptions  uncertainty  and or volatility in the financial markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition  as well as exert downward pressure on our stock price 
having access to the credit and capital markets  at a reasonable cost  is necessary for us to fund our operations and capital requirements 
the capital and credit markets provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our businesses that is not otherwise provided from operating cash flows and also supports our ability to provide credit support for our subsidiaries 
disruptions  uncertainty  and or volatility in those markets could increase our cost of capital or limit the availability of capital 
if we or our subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable  we may have to delay raising capital  issue shorter term securities  and or bear an increased cost of capital 
this  in turn  could impact our ability to grow or sustain our current businesses  cause a reduction in earnings  result in a credit rating downgrade  and or limit our ability to sustain our current common stock dividend level 
a reduction in our or our subsidiaries credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations  and liquidity 
we cannot be sure that any of our or our subsidiaries credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if  in the rating agency s judgment  circumstances in the future so warrant 
any downgrade could require the payment of higher interest rates in future financings and possibly reduce the potential pool of creditors  increase borrowing costs under certain existing credit facilities  limit access to the commercial paper market  limit the availability of adequate credit support for our subsidiaries operations  and require provision of additional credit assurance  including cash margin calls  to contract counterparties 
fluctuating commodity prices may impact energy margins and result in changes to liquidity requirements 
the margins and liquidity requirements of our businesses are impacted by changes in the forward and current market prices of natural gas  coal  electricity  renewable energy credits  and ancillary services 
changes in price could result in higher working capital costs  particularly related to natural gas inventory  accounts receivable  and cash collateral postings  increased liquidity requirements due to potential counterparty margin calls related to the use of derivative instruments to manage commodity price and volume exposure  reduced profitability to the extent that reduced margins  increased bad debt  and interest expenses are not recovered through rates  higher rates charged to our customers  which could impact the company s competitive position  reduced demand for energy  which could impact margins and operating expenses  and shutting down of generation facilities if the cost of generation exceeds the market price for electricity 

table of contents we have recorded goodwill and other intangibles that could become impaired 
to the extent the value of goodwill or other intangibles becomes impaired  we have had to  and in the future  may also be required to  incur material noncash charges relating to such impairments 
these impairment charges could have a material impact on our financial results 
we are subject to the wisconsin public utility holding act  which may limit merger and acquisition opportunities that could benefit our shareholders 
the wisconsin public utility holding company law limits our ability to invest in non utility related businesses and may make it more difficult for others to obtain control of us 
this law mandates that the pscw must first determine that the acquisition is in the best interests of utility customers  investors  and the public 
those interests may  to some extent  be mutually exclusive 
this provision and other requirements of the wisconsin public utility holding company law may delay  or reduce the likelihood of  a sale or change of control thus reducing the likelihood that shareholders will receive a takeover premium for their shares

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a diversified energy holding company with regulated natural gas and electric utility operations serving customers in illinois  michigan  minnesota  and wisconsin  nonregulated energy operations  and an approximate equity ownership interest in atc a federally regulated electric transmission company operating in wisconsin  michigan  minnesota  and illinois 
strategic overview our goal is to create long term value for shareholders and customers through growth in our core regulated businesses 
we also have a nonregulated energy services business segment that is focused on growth within a controlled risk profile 
the essential components of our business strategy are maintaining and growing a strong regulated utility base a strong regulated utility base is essential to maintaining a strong balance sheet  predictable cash flows  the desired risk profile  attractive dividends  and quality credit ratings 
this is critical to our success as a strategically focused regulated business 
we believe the following projects have helped  or will help  maintain and grow our regulated utility base and meet our customers needs an accelerated annual investment in natural gas distribution facilities primarily replacement of cast iron mains at pgl 
wps s continued investment in environmental projects to improve air quality and meet the requirements set by environmental regulators 
capital projects to construct and or upgrade equipment to meet or exceed required environmental standards are planned each year 
our approximate ownership interest in atc  a transmission company that had over billion of transmission assets at december  atc plans to invest approximately billion to billion during the next ten years 
although atc s equity requirements to fund its capital investments will primarily be met by earnings reinvestment  we plan to continue to fund our share of the equity portion of future atc growth as necessary 
for more detailed information on our capital expenditure program  see liquidity and capital resources  capital requirements 
continuing emphasis on safe  reliable  competitively priced  and environmentally sound energy and related services our mission is to provide customers with the best value in energy and related services 
ensuring continued reliability for our customers  we strive to effectively operate a mixed portfolio of generation assets and invest in new generation and natural gas distribution assets  while maintaining or exceeding environmental standards 
this allows us to provide a safe  reliable  value priced service to our customers 
we concentrate our efforts on improving and operating efficiently in order to reduce costs and maintain a low risk profile 
we actively evaluate opportunities for adding more renewable generation to provide additional environmentally sound energy to our portfolio 
our recent entry into the compressed natural gas fueling marketplace  while not currently significant  is complementary to our existing businesses and is consistent with our mission 
operating a nonregulated energy services business segment with a controlled risk and capital profile through our nonregulated integrys energy services subsidiary  we provide retail natural gas and electric products to end use customers in the northeast quadrant of the united states 
in addition  integrys energy services continues to develop  acquire  own and operate renewable energy projects  primarily distributed solar generation  in the united states 
we have repositioned this subsidiary from a focus on significant growth in wholesale and retail electric markets across the united states and canada  to a focus on operating within select retail electric and natural gas markets in our current market footprint where we have experience and believe we will have the most success growing our recurring customer based business 
the current strategy is intended to result in more dependable cash and earnings contributions with a controlled risk and capital profile 
integrating resources to provide operational excellence we are committed to integrating resources of all our businesses  while meeting all applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
this will provide the best value to customers and shareholders by leveraging the individual capabilities and expertise of each business and lowering costs 
operational excellence initiatives are implemented to encourage top performance in the areas of project management  process improvement  contract administration  and compliance in order to reduce costs and manage projects and activities within appropriate budgets  schedules  and regulations 
placing strong emphasis on asset and risk management our asset management strategy calls for the continuous assessment of existing assets  the acquisition of assets  and contractual commitments to obtain resources that complement our existing business and strategy 
the goal is to provide the most efficient use of resources while maximizing return and maintaining an acceptable risk profile 
this strategy focuses on acquiring assets consistent with strategic plans and disposing of assets  including property  plant  and equipment and entire business units  that 
table of contents are no longer strategic to ongoing operations  are not performing as intended  or have an unacceptable risk profile 
we maintain a portfolio approach to risk and earnings 
our risk management strategy includes the management of market  credit  liquidity  and operational risks through the normal course of business 
forward purchases and sales of electric capacity  energy  natural gas  and other commodities and the use of derivative financial instruments  including commodity swaps and options  provide opportunities to reduce the risk associated with price movement in a volatile energy market 
each business unit manages the risk profile related to these instruments consistent with our risk management policies  which are approved by the board of directors 
the corporate risk management group  which reports through the chief financial officer  provides corporate oversight

there was an approximate decrease in the average per unit cost of natural gas sold during  which had no impact on margins 
regulated natural gas utility segment margins decreased million 
the decrease in margins was driven by the approximate million negative year over year impact at pgl and nsg of higher regulatory refunds and lower regulatory recoveries that are offset by equal decreases in operating and maintenance expense  resulting in no impact on earnings 
we refunded approximately million more to customers under bad debt riders in we also recovered approximately million less for environmental cleanup costs at our former manufactured gas plant sites in see note  regulatory environment  for more information on the pgl and nsg bad debt riders and note  commitment and contingencies  for more information on our manufactured gas plant sites 

table of contents the decrease in margins was partially offset by an approximate million net increase in margins as a result of a increase in volumes sold 
higher sales volumes excluding the impact of weather resulted in approximately million of additional margins 
we attribute this increase to a combination of higher use per customer  higher average customer counts  and improved economic conditions for certain customers 
colder weather during  as shown by the increase in heating degree days  drove an approximate million increase in margins 
partially offsetting these increases was an approximate million decrease due to decoupling mechanisms at certain natural gas utilities 
although decoupling was implemented to minimize the impact of changes in sales volumes  it does not cover all jurisdictions or customers 
during  decoupling lessened the positive impact from some of the increased sales volumes through higher future customer refunds

operating income operating income at the regulated natural gas utility segment increased million 
this increase was primarily driven by a million decrease in operating expenses  partially offset by the million decrease in margins discussed above 
the decrease in operating expenses primarily related to an approximate million decrease due to higher amortization of regulatory liabilities related to bad debt riders and lower amortization of regulatory assets related to environmental cleanup costs for manufactured gas plant sites  all at pgl and nsg 
margins decreased by an equal amount  resulting in no impact on earnings 
a million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense 
wps received approval for lower depreciation rates from the pscw  effective january  the decrease also reflects the impact of a million write off of certain mgu assets in  which is currently pending appeal before the michigan court of appeals 
a million decrease in employee benefits expense  partially driven by lower employee health care costs 
a million decrease in customer accounts expense resulting from lower customer call volumes and a decrease in labor associated with fewer disconnections 
a million decrease in asset usage charges from ibs related to retirement of certain computer hardware 

table of contents these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in natural gas distribution costs 
the increase was partially due to additional labor related to distribution operations activities and additional consulting costs associated with a work asset management system and the amrp 
transportation costs  building maintenance  meter maintenance projects  and other miscellaneous distribution costs also contributed to the increase 
a million increase in expenses related to energy conservation and efficiency programs 
this net increase includes expenses related to the cip that were recovered through the merc rate increase discussed in margins above

management believes that natural gas utility margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating natural gas utility operations than natural gas revenues since we pass through prudently incurred natural gas commodity costs to our customers in current rates 
there was an approximate decrease in the average per unit cost of natural gas sold during  which had no impact on margins 
regulated natural gas utility segment margins increased million  driven by the approximate million positive impact of rate increases 
these rate increases were necessary  in part  to recover higher operating expenses as discussed below 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information on these rate increases 
the rate increases at pgl and nsg had an approximate million positive impact on margins 
the rate increase at wps and mgu had an approximate million and million positive impact on margins  respectively 
a rate increase at merc related to its cip had an approximate million positive impact on margins 
cip margins are offset by a corresponding increase in operating and maintenance expense and  therefore  had no impact on earnings 
this increase in margins was partially offset by an approximate million decrease in margins resulting from the lower volumes sold  related to an approximate million decrease related to warmer weather during  as evidenced by the decrease in heating degree days 
an approximate million decrease related to lower sales volumes excluding the impact of weather 
residential customer sales volumes decreased  which we attribute to energy conservation  efficiency efforts  and general economic conditions 
this decrease was partially offset by a net increase in commercial and industrial sales volumes for both retail and transportation customers  driven by certain transportation customers of merc and mgu 
partially offsetting these decreases was the approximate million increase in due to decoupling mechanisms in place at certain of our regulated natural gas utilities 
under decoupling  certain of our regulated natural gas utilities are allowed to defer the difference between the actual and rate case authorized delivery charge components of margin from certain customers and adjust future rates in accordance with rules applicable to each jurisdiction 
the decoupling mechanism for wps s natural gas utility includes an annual million cap for the deferral of any excess or shortfall from the rate case authorized margin 
this cap was reached in the first quarter of but was not reached in an approximate million net decrease in margins driven by lower recovery of environmental cleanup expenditures at our former manufactured gas plant sites  partially offset by an increase in margins related to recoveries received under the pgl and nsg bad debt riders 
these amounts were offset by an equal net decrease in operating and maintenance expense resulting from lower net amortization of the related regulatory assets and  therefore  had no impact on earnings 
recoveries under these riders represent net billings to customers of the excess or deficiency of actual and bad debt expense over bad debt expense reflected in utility rates during those same periods 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information on the pgl and nsg bad debt riders

see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  for information related to the goodwill impairment loss recorded in the increase in other operating expenses primarily related to a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  primarily due to the icc s rate order for pgl and nsg  effective january  this rate order allows earlier recovery in rates for net dismantling costs by including them as a component of depreciation rates applied to natural gas distribution assets 
the increase also reflects the impact of a million write off of certain mgu assets  which is currently pending appeal before the michigan court of appeals 
a million increase in expenses related to energy conservation programs and enhanced efficiency initiatives 
this increase includes expenses related to the cip that were recovered through the merc rate increase discussed in margins above

management believes that electric utility margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than electric operating revenues 
to the extent changes in fuel and purchased power costs are passed through to customers  the changes are offset by comparable changes in operating revenues 
any significant changes in fuel and purchased power costs that are not recovered from customers are explained in the margin discussion below 
regulated electric utility segment margins decreased million  driven by an approximate million decrease in retail margins due to differences between the wps rate order and the previous rate order 
although the rate order included a lower authorized return on common equity  lower rate base  and other reduced costs  which resulted in lower total revenues and margins  the rate order also projected lower total sales volumes  which led to a rate increase on a per unit basis

other future considerations decoupling in certain jurisdictions  decoupling mechanisms have been implemented 
these mechanisms differ state by state and allow utilities to adjust future rates to recover or refund all or a portion of the differences between actual and authorized margin 
decoupling for residential and small commercial and industrial sales was approved by the icc on a four year trial basis for pgl and nsg  effective march  interveners  including the illinois attorney general  oppose decoupling and have appealed the icc s approval 
pgl and nsg actively support the icc s decision to approve decoupling 
in the pgl and nsg rate order approved on january   the icc made the decoupling mechanism based on total margin permanent for both companies 
the appeal of the original decoupling order is pending and  depending on the outcome  could impact the current rate order provision for decoupling 
decoupling for natural gas and electric residential and small commercial and industrial sales was approved by the pscw on a four year trial basis for wps  effective january   and ending on december  the mechanism does not adjust for variations in volumes resulting from changes in customer count compared to rate case levels  nor does it cover all customer classes 
this decoupling mechanism includes an annual million cap for electric service and an annual million cap for natural gas service 
amounts recoverable from or refundable to customers are subject to these caps and are included in rates upon approval in a rate order 
wps expects to address decoupling beyond in its rate case filing for decoupling for uppco was approved for the majority of customer classes by the mpsc  effective january   and ended on december  a new weather normalized decoupling mechanism based on total margin will become effective for uppco on january  uppco has no decoupling mechanism in place for the mpsc granted an order  effective january   approving a decoupling mechanism for mgu that covers residential and small commercial and industrial customers 
the decoupling mechanism does not adjust for weather related usage  nor does it adjust for variations in volumes resulting from changes in customer count compared to rate case levels 
the decoupling mechanism does not cover all customer classes 
in minnesota  merc proposed a decoupling mechanism in its november  general rate case filing 
a final order is expected in the second quarter of see note  regulatory environment  for more information 
climate change the epa began regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act in january by applying the best available control technology bact requirements associated with the new source review program to new and modified larger greenhouse gas emitters 
technology to remove and sequester greenhouse gas emissions is not commercially available at scale 
therefore  the epa issued guidance that defines bact in terms of improvements in energy efficiency as opposed to relying on pollution control equipment 
in december  the epa announced its intent to develop new source performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions 
the standards would apply to new and modified  as well as existing  electric utility steam generating units 
the epa planned to propose these standards in and finalize them in  however  the proposal has since been delayed 

table of contents a risk exists that any greenhouse gas legislation or regulation will increase the cost of producing energy using fossil fuels 
however  we believe the capital expenditures being made at our plants are appropriate under any reasonable mandatory greenhouse gas program 
we also believe that future expenditures by our regulated electric and natural gas utilities that may be required to control greenhouse gas emissions or meet renewable portfolio standards will be recoverable in rates 
we will continue to monitor and manage potential risks and opportunities associated with future greenhouse gas legislative or regulatory actions 
the majority of our generation and distribution facilities are located in the upper midwest region of the united states 
the same is true for the majority of our customers facilities 
the physical risks posed by climate change for these areas are not expected to be significant at this time 
ongoing evaluations will be conducted as more information on the extent of such physical changes becomes available 
property tax assessment on natural gas our subsidiaries and natural gas retailers purchase storage services from pipeline companies on interstate systems 
some states tax natural gas held as working natural gas in facilities located within their jurisdiction as personal property 
shippers that are being assessed a tax are actively protesting these property tax assessments 
merc is currently pursuing a protest through litigation in kansas 
federal health care reform in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of hcr were signed into law 
hcr contains various provisions that will affect the cost of providing health care coverage to our active and retired employees and their dependents 
although these provisions become effective at various times over the next years  some provisions that affect the cost of providing benefits to retirees were reflected in our financial statements in and beginning in  a provision of hcr will eliminate the tax deduction for employer paid postretirement prescription drug charges to the extent those charges will be offset by the receipt of a federal medicare part d subsidy 
as a result  we eliminated million of our deferred tax asset related to postretirement benefits in of this amount  million flowed through to net income as a component of income tax expense in the remaining million was deferred for regulatory recovery at uppco 
an additional million was expensed in june for deferred income taxes related to a wisconsin tax law change see discussion in recent tax law changes below 
in the fourth quarter of  pgl and nsg recorded a regulatory asset of million  reversing amounts previously expensed in  as pgl and nsg were authorized recovery of these amounts in the rate order approved on january  in addition  wps was authorized recovery in february for the portion related to its michigan operations that was previously expensed in we expect to seek rate recovery for the remaining million of income tax expense that relates to this tax law change associated with our regulated operations 
if recovery in rates becomes probable in the remaining jurisdiction  income tax expense will be reduced in that period 
we are not currently able to predict how much of the remaining portion  if any  will be recovered in rates 
other provisions of hcr include the elimination of certain annual and lifetime maximum benefits and the broadening of plan eligibility requirements 
it also includes the elimination of pre existing condition restrictions  an excise tax on high cost health plans  changes to the medicare part d prescription drug program  and numerous other changes 
we participate in the early retiree reinsurance program that became effective on june  we continue to assess the extent to which the provisions of the new law will affect our future health care and related employee benefit plan costs 
dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act the dodd frank act was signed into law in july however  significant rulings essential to its framework still remain outstanding 
depending on the final rules  certain provisions of the dodd frank act relating to derivatives could increase capital and or collateral requirements 
final rules for these provisions are expected in the second quarter of we are monitoring developments related to this act and their impacts on our future financial results 
recent tax law changes federal in december  president obama signed into law the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of this act includes tax incentives  such as an extension and increase of bonus depreciation  the extension of the research and experimentation credit  and the extension of treasury grants in lieu of claiming the investment tax credit or production tax credit for certain renewable energy investments 
in september  president obama signed into law the small business jobs act of this act includes tax incentives  such as an extension to bonus depreciation and changes to listed property  that affect us 
we anticipate that these tax law changes will likely result in million to million of reduced cash payments for taxes during these tax incentives may also reduce utility rate base and  
table of contents thus  future earnings relative to prior expectations 
we have primarily used the proceeds from these incentives to make incremental contributions to our various employee benefit plans 
in addition  these tax incentives have helped reduce our financing needs 
in december  the national defense authorization act ndaa was enacted 
the most significant provision of the ndaa was to retroactively eliminate the application of the tax normalization rule for cash grants taken by a regulated utility in lieu of the investment tax credit or production tax credits 
prior to the enactment of ndaa  a regulated utility would have been required to amortize the grant in rates over the regulatory life of the renewable energy generating plant 
further  the allowed rate of return on the generating plant could not be reduced by the unamortized grant balance during the life of the plant 
as a result of the enactment of ndaa  we are evaluating our options for taking advantage of cash grants in lieu of the production tax credits we are currently claiming for wps s crane creek wind project 
illinois in january  governor quinn signed into law the taxpayer accountability and budget stabilization act 
this act increased the corporate combined income tax rate from to retroactive to january  the rate decreases to after and returns to after we adjusted deferred taxes to reflect the changes in the tax rate in the first quarter of due to the effects of regulation  and the timing of the january  rate order for pgl and nsg  we do not expect a material impact on income from this legislation 
michigan in may  governor snyder signed legislation that replaced michigan s business tax with a state income tax  effective january  in accounting for this tax law change  we expensed million of deferred income taxes in primarily related to our nonregulated operations and our unitary filings 
we deferred an additional million in for recovery in future rates 
wisconsin in june  governor walker signed into law a two year budget bill 
under the bill  the wisconsin tax code was changed to conform to the federal tax code  retroactive to december in accounting for this tax law change  we expensed an additional million of deferred income taxes in related to the medicare part d subsidy 
the legislation also contains favorable provisions related to the carryforward of net operating losses prior to off balance sheet arrangements see note  guarantees  for information regarding guarantees 
critical accounting policies we have determined that the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
risk management activities we have entered into contracts that are accounted for as derivatives 
all derivative contracts are recorded at fair value on the balance sheets  unless they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception  which provides that recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements is not required until the settlement of the contracts 
changes in fair value  except effective portions of derivative instruments designated as hedges or qualifying for regulatory deferral  generally affect net income attributed to common shareholders at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled 
at december   those derivatives not designated as hedges were primarily commodity contracts used to manage price risk associated with natural gas and electricity purchase and sale activities 
cash flow hedge accounting treatment may be used to protect against changes in interest rates 
fair value hedge accounting may be used when we hold assets  liabilities  or firm commitments and enter into transactions that hedge the risk of changes in commodity prices or interest rates 
to the extent that the hedging instrument is fully effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact on net income attributed to common shareholders prior to settlement of the hedge 
we have based our valuations on observable inputs whenever possible 
however  at times  the valuation of certain derivative instruments requires the use of internally developed valuation techniques and or significant unobservable inputs 
these valuations require a significant amount of management judgment and are classified as level measurements 
of the total risk management assets on our balance sheets  million were classified as level measurements 
of the total risk management liabilities  million were classified as level measurements 
we believe these valuations represent the fair values of these instruments as of the reporting date  however  the actual 
table of contents amounts realized upon settlement of these instruments could vary materially from the reported amounts due to movements in market prices and changes in the liquidity of certain markets 
as a component of fair value determinations  we consider counterparty credit risk  our own credit risk  and liquidity risk 
the liquidity component of the fair value determination may be especially subjective when limited liquid market information is available 
changes in the underlying assumptions for the credit and liquidity risk components of fair value at december   would have had the following effects change in risk components effect on fair value of net risk management liabilities at december  millions increase decrease decrease increase these hypothetical changes in fair value would be included in current and long term assets and liabilities from risk management activities on the balance sheets and as part of nonregulated revenues on the income statements 
as of july   integrys energy services discontinued the use of cash flow hedge accounting 
see note  risk management activities for further discussion 
goodwill impairment we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests for all of our reporting units that carry a goodwill balance as of april  no impairment was recorded as a result of these tests 
for all of our reporting units  the fair value calculated in step one of the test was greater than the carrying value 
the fair value was calculated using an equal weighting of the income approach and the market approach 
for the income approach  we used internal forecasts to project cash flows 
any forecast contains a degree of uncertainty  and changes in these cash flows could significantly increase or decrease the fair value of a reporting unit 
for the regulated reporting units  a fair recovery of and return on costs prudently incurred to serve customers is assumed 
an unfavorable outcome in a rate case could cause the fair value of these reporting units to decrease 
key assumptions used in the income approach included return on equity for the regulated reporting units  long term growth rates used to determine terminal values at the end of the discrete forecast period  and discount rates 
the discount rate is applied to estimated future cash flows and is one of the most significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach 
as interest rates rise  the calculated fair values will decrease 
the discount rate is determined based on the weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit  taking into account both the after tax cost of debt and cost of equity 
the terminal year return on equity roe for each utility is based on its current allowed roe adjusted for forecasted disallowed costs and expectations regarding the direction and magnitude of movements in interest rates 
the terminal growth rate is based on a combination of historical and forecasted statistics for real gross domestic product and personal income for each utility service area 
we used the guideline company method for the market approach 
this method uses metrics from similar publicly traded companies in the same industry to determine how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for an investment in a similar company 
we applied multiples derived from these guideline companies to the appropriate operating metric for the utility reporting units to determine indications of fair value 
the underlying assumptions and estimates used in the impairment test are made as of a point in time 
subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could change the results of the test 
the fair values of the wps natural gas utility and integrys energy services reporting units exceeded the carrying values by a substantial amount 
based on these results  these reporting units are not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test 
the fair values calculated in the first step of the test for mgu  merc  pgl  and nsg exceeded the carrying values by approximately to 
due to the subjectivity of the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment analysis  we cannot provide assurance that future analyses will not result in impairments 
as a result  we performed a sensitivity analysis on key assumptions for these reporting units 
the following table shows the change in each assumption  holding all other inputs constant  that would result in a fair value at or below carrying value  causing the applicable reporting unit to fail step one of the test change in key inputs in basis points mgu merc pgl nsg discount rate terminal year return on equity terminal year growth rate n a n a 
table of contents even with a terminal year growth rate of  assuming all other inputs remained constant  these reporting units would still have passed the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
accrued unbilled revenues we accrue estimated amounts of revenues for services provided or energy delivered but not yet billed to customers 
estimated unbilled revenues are calculated using a variety of judgments and assumptions related to customer class or contracted rates 
significant changes in these judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations 
at december  and  our unbilled revenues were million and million  respectively 
the amount of unbilled revenues can vary significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors  including seasonality  weather  customer usage patterns  commodity prices  and customer mix 
pension and other postretirement benefits the costs of providing non contributory defined benefit pension benefits and other postretirement benefits  described in note  employee benefit plans  are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions regarding future experience 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels  and employment periods  the level of contributions made to the plans  and earnings on plan assets 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and expected health care cost trends 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
our pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns  as well as changes in general interest rates  may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods 
we believe that such changes in costs would be recovered at the regulated segments through the ratemaking process 
the following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost 
each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only 
actuarial assumption millions  except percentages percentage point change in assumption impact on projected benefit obligation impact on pension cost discount rate discount rate rate of return on plan assets n a rate of return on plan assets n a the following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation and the reported net periodic other postretirement benefit cost

the bonds are generally rated aa with a minimum amount outstanding of million 
from the hypothetical bond portfolios  a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans expected future benefit payments 
we establish our expected return on asset assumption based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns  as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios 
the assumed long term rate of return was in  and in and for   and  the actual rates of return on pension plan assets  net of fees  were   and  respectively 

table of contents the determination of expected return on qualified plan assets is based on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
cumulative gains and losses in excess of of the greater of the pension or other postretirement benefit obligation or market related value are amortized over the average remaining future service to expected retirement ages 
changes in realized and unrealized investment gains and losses are recognized over the subsequent five years for plans sponsored by wps  while differences between actual investment returns and the expected return on plan assets are recognized over a five year period for pension plans sponsored by ibs and pellc 
because of this method  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are included in market related value 
in selecting assumed health care cost trend rates  past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered 
for more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future payments that we expect to make for our pension and other postretirement benefits  see note  employee benefit plans 
regulatory accounting our electric and natural gas utility segments follow the guidance under the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc 
our financial statements reflect the effects of the ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments 
certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers  as authorized by our regulators 
future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured  and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness 
management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment  earnings at the electric and natural gas utility segments  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
once approved  the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into earnings over the rate recovery period 
if recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer deemed probable  these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period earnings 
the application of the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of our electric and natural gas utility segment s operations no longer meet the criteria for application 
assets and liabilities recognized as a result of rate regulation would be written off as extraordinary items in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred 
a write off of all our regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at december   would result in a decrease in total assets and a decrease in total liabilities 
the two largest regulatory assets at december   related to unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit costs and environmental remediation costs 
a write off of the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit related regulatory asset at december   would result in a decrease in total assets 
a write off of the regulatory asset related to environmental remediation costs at december   would result in a decrease in total assets 
see note  regulatory assets and liabilities  for more information 
income tax provision we are required to estimate income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements 
this process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our balance sheets 
we also assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance  which is offset by an adjustment to the provision for income taxes in the income statements 
uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates 
only income tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized 
unrecognized tax benefits are re evaluated quarterly and changes are recorded based on new information  including the issuance of relevant guidance by the courts or tax authorities and developments occurring in the examinations of our tax returns 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred income tax assets and liabilities  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets 
the assumptions involved are supported by historical data  reasonable projections  and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions 
significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
see note p  summary of significant accounting policies income taxes  and note  income taxes  for a discussion of accounting for income taxes 
impact of inflation our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the statements provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but generally do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
to the extent our regulated operations are not recovering the effects of inflation  they will file rate cases as necessary in the various jurisdictions in which they operate 
our nonregulated businesses include inflation in forecasted costs 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks and other significant risks we have potential market risk exposure related to commodity price risk  interest rate risk  and equity return and principal preservation risk 
we are also exposed to other significant risks due to the nature of our subsidiaries businesses and the environment in which we operate 
we have risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures  as further described below 
commodity price risk utilities the electric utilities purchase coal  natural gas  and fuel oil for use in power generation 
they also buy power from the miso market at a price that is often reflective of the underlying cost of natural gas used in power generation 
prudent fuel and purchased power costs and capacity payments are recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms by uppco  and by the wholesale electric operations and michigan retail electric operations of wps 
the costs of natural gas used by the natural gas utilities are also generally recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms 
these recovery mechanisms greatly reduce commodity price risk for the utilities 
wps s wisconsin retail electric operations do not have a one for one recovery mechanism for price fluctuations 
instead  a fuel window mechanism substantially mitigates this price risk 
to manage commodity price risk for their customers  the regulated utilities enter into contracts of various durations for the purchase and or sale of natural gas  fuel for electric generation  and electricity 
in addition  the electric operations of wps and uppco  and the natural gas operations of wps  pgl  nsg  and merc  employ risk management techniques  which include the use of derivative instruments such as swaps  futures  and options 
see note f  summary of significant accounting policies revenues and customer receivables  for more information 
integrys energy services integrys energy services seeks to reduce market price risk from its generation and energy supply portfolios through the use of various financial and physical instruments 
additionally  integrys energy services uses volume limits and stop loss limits to limit its exposure to commodity price movements 
to measure commodity price risk exposure  integrys energy services employs a number of controls and processes  including a value at risk var analysis of its exposures 
integrys energy services var calculation is used to quantify exposure to market risk associated with its open commodity positions primarily natural gas and power positions 
the var calculation excludes the positions created by owning energy assets and associated coal  sulfur dioxide emission allowances  renewable energy credits  and other ancillary fuels 
additionally  financial transmission rights  certain electric ancillary services  and certain portions of long dated natural gas storage and transportation contracts are also excluded from the var calculation 
the capped downside nature of the risks and duration of these positions would result in a var that would not be representative of the actual exposure 
therefore  integrys energy services evaluates the exposures for these types of contracts by assessing the maximum potential loss of the positions  which is either the cost of the physical asset or the fixed demand charges for the contract 
var is a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk 
the var amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from changes in market factors  within a given confidence level  if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period 
in addition to var  integrys energy services employs other risk measurements including mark to market valuations  stress testing  and scenario based testing 
in conjunction with the var analysis  these other risk measurements provide the risk management analysis for integrys energy services risk exposure 
var is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
var has a number of limitations that are important to consider when evaluating the calculation results 
most importantly  var does not represent the maximum potential loss of the portfolio 
price movements outside of the relevant confidence levels can and do occur and may result in losses exceeding the reported var 
large short term price moves can be caused by catastrophic weather events or other drivers of short term supply and demand disruptions 
also  the holding period may not always be an adequate assessment of the timeframe to close out positions 
short term reductions in market liquidity could cause integrys energy services to hold positions open longer than anticipated  resulting in greater than predicted losses 
additionally  there are other risks not captured by the var metric including  but not limited to  the risk of customer and vendor nonperformance and the risks associated with the liquidity in the markets in which integrys energy services transacts 
customer and vendor nonperformance risk could result in bad debt losses  realized and unrealized losses on commodity contracts  or increased supply costs in the event that contractual obligations of counterparties are not met 
market liquidity risk refers to the risk that integrys energy services will not be able to efficiently enter or exit commodity positions 

table of contents integrys energy services var is calculated using non discounted positions with a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a confidence level  as well as a ten day holding period and a confidence level 
the delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods  such as one day or ten days  are normally distributed 
integrys energy services var calculation includes financial and physical commodity instruments  such as forwards  futures  swaps  and options  as well as natural gas inventory  natural gas storage  and transportation contracts  to the extent such positions are significant  but excludes the positions mentioned above 
the var for integrys energy services portfolio at a confidence level and a one day holding period is presented in the following table millions as of december average for months ended december high for months ended december low for months ended december the var for integrys energy services portfolio at a confidence level and a ten day holding period is presented in the following table millions as of december average for months ended december high for months ended december low for months ended december the average  high  and low amounts were computed using the var amounts at each of the four quarter ends 
the year over year decrease in var was driven primarily by reduced business size  as a result of integrys energy services strategy change 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from our variable rate long term debt and short term borrowings 
we manage exposure to interest rate risk by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates 
we enter into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so 
we may also enter into derivative financial instruments  such as swaps  to mitigate interest rate exposure 
due to short term borrowings  we are exposed to variable interest rates 
based on our variable rate debt outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points would have increased annual interest expense by million 
comparatively  based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased annual interest expense by million 
this sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates  with no other changes for the remainder of the period 
equity return and principal preservation risk we currently fund liabilities related to employee benefits through various external trust funds 
the trust funds are managed by numerous investment managers and hold investments primarily in debt and equity securities 
changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
declines in the equity markets or declines in interest rates may result in increased future costs for the plans and require additional contributions into the plans 
we monitor the trust fund portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices 
most of the employee benefit costs relate to the regulated utilities 
as such  the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates  reducing most of the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures 
also  the likelihood of an increase in the employee benefit obligations  which the investments must fund  has been partially mitigated as a result of certain employee groups no longer being eligible to participate in  or accumulate benefits in  certain pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
our defined benefit pension plans are closed to all new hires
