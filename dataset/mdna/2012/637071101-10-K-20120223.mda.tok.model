item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with any of the numerous federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies that govern environmental protection  zoning and other matters applicable to our businesses 
our businesses are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies governing environmental protection  zoning and other matters 
these laws and regulations have changed frequently in the past and it is reasonable to expect additional changes in the future 
if existing regulatory requirements change  we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures 
we cannot assure you that our operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations 
governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on us or to revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
under these circumstances  we might be required to reduce or cease operations or conduct site remediation or other corrective action which could adversely impact our operations and financial condition 
our businesses expose us to potential environmental liability 
our businesses expose us to the risk that harmful substances may escape into the environment  which could result in personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  or environmental damage and suspension of operations 

index to financial statements our current and past activities  as well as the activities of our former divisions and subsidiaries  could result in our facing substantial environmental  regulatory and other liabilities 
these could include the costs of cleanup of contaminated sites and site closure obligations 
these liabilities could also be imposed on the basis of one or more of the following theories negligence  strict liability  breach of contract with customers  or as a result of our contractual agreement to indemnify our customers in the normal course of business  which is normally the case 
we may not have adequate insurance for potential environmental liabilities 
while we maintain liability insurance  this insurance is subject to coverage limits 
in addition  certain policies do not provide coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination 
we face the following risks with respect to our insurance coverage we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms  we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance  our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies  or the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits 
even a partially uninsured claim  if successful and of significant size  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could increase our operating costs or reduce demand for our products 
environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the united states and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change 
the adoption of laws and regulations to implement controls of greenhouse gases  including the imposition of fees or taxes  could adversely impact our operations and financial condition 
the us congress is currently working on legislation to control and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the united states  which includes establishing cap and trade programs 
in addition to the pending climate legislation  the us environmental protection agency has proposed regulations that would require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities  and may issue final rules this year 
these changes in the legal and regulatory environment could reduce oil and natural gas drilling activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services  which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
we had revenues of of total revenue from one of our customers for the year ended december  the loss of this customer samsung heavy industries or a significant reduction in its purchases could adversely affect our future revenues and earnings 
the recent moratorium on deepwater drilling in the us gulf of mexico and its consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a moratorium on deepwater drilling in the us gulf of mexico was enacted during the second quarter of following the macondo well blowout and oil spill 
even though such moratorium has been lifted  any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas drilling and production activity as a result of such moratorium or permitting issues in this area could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services  which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of our information systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger systems and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of the our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

the riser consists of several sections of pipe and includes special devices to compensate for any movement of the drilling rig caused by waves 
also called marine riser pipe  riser joint 

index to financial statements rotary table the principal piece of equipment in the rotary table assembly  a turning device used to impart rotational power to the drill stem while permitting vertical movement of the pipe for rotary drilling 
the master bushing fits inside the opening of the rotary table  it turns the kelly bushing  which permits vertical movement of the kelly while the stem is turning 
rotating blowout preventer rotating head a sealing device used to close off the annular space around the kelly in drilling with pressure at the surface  usually installed above the main blowout preventers 
a rotating head makes it possible to drill ahead even when there is pressure in the annulus that the weight of the drilling fluid is not overcoming  the head prevents the well from blowing out 
it is used mainly in the drilling of formations that have low permeability 
the rate of penetration through such formations is usually rapid 
safety clamps a clamp placed very tightly around a drill collar that is suspended in the rotary table by drill collar slips 
should the slips fail  the clamp is too large to go through the opening in the rotary table and therefore prevents the drill collar string from falling into the hole 
also called drill collar clamp 
shaker see shale shaker shale shaker a piece of drilling rig equipment that uses a vibrating screen to remove cuttings from the circulating fluid in rotary drilling operations 
the size of the openings in the screen should be selected carefully to be the smallest size possible to allow per cent flow of the fluid 
also called a shaker 
slim hole completions slim hole drilling drilling in which the size of the hole is smaller than the conventional hole diameter for a given depth 
this decrease in hole size enables the operator to run smaller casing  thereby lessening the cost of completion

operating profit excluding transaction and restructuring charges was million or of sales for the fourth quarter of oil and gas equipment and services market worldwide developed economies turned down sharply late in as looming housing related asset write downs at major financial institutions paralyzed credit markets and sparked a serious global banking crisis 
major central banks responded vigorously through  but a credit driven worldwide economic recession developed nonetheless 
developed economies struggled to recover throughout and  facing additional economic weakness related to potential sovereign debt defaults in europe 
as a result  commodity prices  including oil and gas prices  have been volatile 
after rising steadily for six years to peak at around per barrel earlier in  oil prices collapsed back to average per barrel west texas intermediate crude during the first quarter of  but slowly recovered into the to per barrel range by the end of where they held relatively steady throughout the fourth quarter of averaged per barrel 
after averaging to an mmbtu  north american gas prices declined to average per mmbtu in the third quarter of gas prices recovered modestly  trading up above six months later  but then slowly settled into the to per mmbtu since 
the fourth quarter of averaged per mmbtu  however  north american gas turned down sharply around year end  trading below per mmbtu  reflecting rising supplies of gas produced from new unconventional shale reservoirs 
the steadily rising oil and gas prices seen between and led to high levels of exploration and development drilling in many oil and gas basins around the globe by  but activity slowed sharply in with lower oil and gas prices and tightening credit availability 
strengthening oil prices since then have led to steadily rising drilling activity over the past two years 
the count of rigs actively drilling in the us as measured by baker hughes a good measure of the level of oilfield activity and spending peaked at  rigs in september  but decreased to a low of in june  us rig count has since increased steadily to average  rigs during the fourth quarter of many oil and gas operators reliant on external financing to fund their drilling programs significantly curtailed their drilling activity in  but drilling recovered across north america as gas prices improved 
recently low gas prices have caused operators to trim drilling  driving the us gas rig count down to in the past year 
however  with high and stabilizing oil prices many redirected drilling efforts towards unconventional shale plays targeting oil  rather than gas 
oil drilling has risen to of the total domestic drilling effort and at  rigs drilling  is at the highest levels in the us since the early s 
most international activity is driven by oil exploration and production by national oil companies  which has historically been less susceptible to short term commodity price swings  but the international rig count has exhibited modest declines nonetheless  falling from its september peak of  to in august recently international drilling rebounded due to high oil prices  climbing back to  in january 
index to financial statements during the company saw its petroleum services supplies and its distribution transmission margins affected most acutely by a drilling downturn  through both volume and price declines 
resumption of drilling activity since enabled both of these segments to gain volume  stabilize and lift pricing  and improve margins since the third quarter of the company s rig technology segment was less impacted by the downturn owing to its high level of contracted backlog which it executed on very well 
it posted higher revenues in than as a result 
its revenues declined in as its backlog declined  but increased in as orders for new offshore rigs began to increase 
the recent economic decline beginning in late followed an extended period of high drilling activity which fueled strong demand for oilfield services between and incremental drilling activity through the upswing shifted toward harsh environments  employing increasingly sophisticated technology to find and produce reserves 
higher utilization of drilling rigs tested the capability of the world s fleet of rigs  much of which is old and of limited capability 
technology has advanced significantly since most of the existing rig fleet was built 
the industry invested little during the late s and s on new drilling equipment  but drilling technology progressed steadily nonetheless  as the company and its competitors continued to invest in new and better ways of drilling 
as a consequence  the safety  reliability  and efficiency of new  modern rigs surpass the performance of most of the older rigs at work today 
drilling rigs are now being pushed to drill deeper wells  more complex wells  highly deviated wells and horizontal wells  tasks which require larger rigs with more capabilities 
the drilling process effectively consumes the mechanical components of a rig  which wear out and need periodic repair or replacement 
this process was accelerated by very high rig utilization and wellbore complexity 
drilling consumes rigs  more complex and challenging drilling consumes rigs faster 
the industry responded by launching many new rig construction projects since  to retool the existing fleet of jackup rigs according to offshore data services  of the existing jackup rigs are more than years old  replace older mechanical and dc electric land rigs with improved ac power  electronic controls  automatic pipe handling and rapid rigup and rigdown technology  and build out additional deepwater floating drilling rigs  including semisubmersibles and drillships  to employ recent advancements in deepwater drilling to exploit unexplored deepwater basins 
we believe that the newer rigs offer considerably higher efficiency  safety  and capability  and that many will effectively replace a portion of the existing fleet 
as a result of these trends the company s rig technology segment grew its backlog of capital equipment orders from billion at march   to billion at september  however  as a result of the credit crisis and slowing drilling activity  orders declined below amounts flowing out of backlog as revenue  causing the backlog to decline to billion by june  the backlog increased steadily since as drillers began ordering more than the company shipped out of backlog  and finished at billion 
approximately billion of these orders are scheduled to flow out as revenue during  billion are scheduled to flow out as revenue during  and the balance thereafter 
the land rig backlog comprised and equipment destined for offshore operations comprised of the total backlog as of december  equipment destined for international markets totaled of the backlog 
segment performance the rig technology segment generated billion in revenues and billion in operating profit or of sales during compared to the prior year revenues improved  but generated no incremental operating profit year over year due to a broad change in the segment s business mix  which led to lower margins 
offshore projects contracted at high prices in and were manufactured in low cost environments in  resulting in high margins for the group 
as these projects were completed and replaced with lower priced projects  margins declined basis points from the prior year 
for the fourth quarter of the segment produced revenues of  million  representing an improvement from the third quarter and a improvement from the fourth quarter of segment operating profit was million and operating margins were during the fourth quarter 
operating leverage or flow through was sequentially  and year over year  lower than the that is typical for the group owing to the mix effect described above 
revenue out of backlog grew sequentially and year over year 
non backlog revenue  which is predominantly aftermarket spares and services  declined four percent sequentially and increased from the fourth quarter of orders for three deepwater floating rigs  six jackup drilling packages  and higher land drilling rig  pressure pumping and stimulation equipment demand contributed to total order additions to backlog of  million during the fourth quarter  capping a year in which orders for the segment set a new record of billion 
interest in offshore rig construction has remained strong as announced dayrates for deepwater offshore rigs appears to be increasing  rig building costs have stabilized  and financing appears to be available for most established drillers 
the company booked an order for seven drillships for brazil in the third quarter of  and continues to tender additional new offshore rig projects for petrobras to shipyards and drilling contractors  which are to be built in brazil 
however  further potential bookings of any additional offshore rigs for brazil are likely to continue to be subject to delays 

index to financial statements the petroleum services supplies segment generated billion in revenue and billion in operating profit  or of sales  for the full year compared to the prior year revenue increased  and operating leverage or flow through the change in operating profit divided by the change in revenue was 
for the fourth quarter of the segment generated total sales of  million in the fourth quarter of  up from the third quarter of and up from the fourth quarter of operating profit was million or of sales during the fourth quarter of year over year operating leverage or flow through from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of was 
the ameron acquisition was completed on october  and its composite pipe segment is being integrated into the group s fiberglass and composite pipe products 
sequential revenue growth was evenly spread across most major areas  albeit with mix shifts from product to product 
europe  russia and the far east posted some of the largest sequential gains  along with good sequential improvement in the us centered in the liquids rich shale plays like the bakken and the eagle ford 
wellsite services and downhole tools posted strong sequential sales growth on higher sales in the eastern hemisphere  canada  and us shales 
drill pipe orders were steady for the quarter  but margins were down as more greentubes were purchased from third party suppliers at higher prices  rather than from the company s joint venture supplier of greentubes 
the distribution transmission segment generated billion in revenue and million in operating profit or of sales during revenues improved from  and flow through or operating leverage was from to for the fourth quarter of revenues were million  up from the third quarter of and up from the fourth quarter of operating profit of million for the fourth quarter produced operating margins of for the quarter  and operating leverage or flow through was from the third quarter of and from the fourth quarter of results for the fourth quarter included the ameron water transmission and infrastructure products segments from october  onward  which were modestly dilutive to the group s margins 
the legacy distribution portion of the segment saw revenues up slightly  with strong flow throughs  due to excellent performance in canada 
international was up slightly and the us was down slightly due to rig moves towards liquids plays  together with related drill site construction delays and weather issues in a few markets 
approximately of the group s fourth quarter sales were into north american markets and into international markets 
outlook following the credit market downturn  global recession  and lower commodity prices of  we saw signs of stabilization and recovery in many of our markets in and into  led by higher drilling activity in north america and slowly improving international drilling activity 
order levels for new drilling rigs has rebounded sharply  and the rig technology segment continues to experience a high level of interest in new capital equipment 
rig dayrates appear to be improving for certain classes of newer technology rigs  and appear to be trending higher for deepwater offshore rigs 
we expect lower pricing in our backlog to lead to modest declines in rig technology margins in the first half of  until recently won offshore rig construction orders begin to generate revenues at higher margins 
our outlook for the company s petroleum services supplies segment and distribution transmission segment remains closely tied to the rig count  particularly in north america 
if the oil rig count growth seen over the past few quarters continues to increase and more than offset gas rig declines  we expect these segments to benefit from higher demand for the services  consumables and capital items they supply 
however  if continued curtailment of gas drilling leads overall rig counts lower  as has been the case for the past few months  then pricing and volumes may come under pressure 
the company believes it is well positioned  and should benefit from its strong balance sheet and capitalization  access to credit  and a high level of contracted orders which are expected to continue to generate earnings during the company has a long history of cost control and downsizing in response to depressed market conditions  and of executing strategic acquisitions during difficult periods 
such a period may present opportunities to the company to effect new organic growth and acquisition initiatives  and we remain hopeful that a downturn will generate new opportunities 
still the recovery of the world economy continues to move forward with a great deal of uncertainty as the world watches the sovereign debt crises in several european countries unfold  market turbulence and general global economic worries 
if such global economic uncertaintanties develop adversely  world oil and gas prices could be impacted which in turn could negatively impact the worldwide rig count and the company s future financial results

this represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution 
due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above

we intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates  but the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
we expect to fund future cash acquisitions and capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings  including the unborrowed portion of the credit facility or new debt issuances  but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us or at all 

index to financial statements critical accounting estimates in preparing the financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition under long term construction contracts  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  impairments of long lived assets excluding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  service and product warranties and income taxes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
revenue recognition under long term construction contracts the company uses the percentage of completion method to account for certain long term construction contracts in the rig technology segment 
these long term construction contracts include the following characteristics the contracts include custom designs for customer specific applications  the structural design is unique and requires significant engineering efforts  and construction projects often have progress payments 
this method requires the company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project  progress against the project schedule and the estimated completion date  all of which impact the amount of revenue and gross margin the company recognizes in each reporting period 
the company prepares detailed cost to complete estimates at the beginning of each project  taking into account all factors considered likely to affect gross margin 
significant projects and their related costs and profit margins are updated and reviewed at least quarterly by senior management 
factors that may affect future project costs and margins include shipyard access  weather  production efficiencies  availability and costs of labor  materials and subcomponents and other factors as mentioned in risk factors 
these factors can significantly impact the accuracy of the company s estimates and materially impact the company s future reported earnings 
historically  the company s estimates have been reasonably dependable regarding the recognition of revenues and gross profits on percentage of completion contracts 
based upon an analysis of percentage of completion contracts for all open contracts outstanding at december  and  adjustments representing the differences between the estimated and actual results to all outstanding contracts resulted in net increases to gross profit margins of million on billion of outstanding contracts and million on billion of outstanding contracts for the years ended december  and  respectively 
while the company believes that its estimates on outstanding contracts at december  and in future periods will continue to be reasonably dependable under percentage of completion accounting  the factors identified in the preceding paragraph could result in significant adjustments in future periods 
the company has recorded revenue on outstanding contracts on a contract to date basis of billion at december  allowance for doubtful accounts the determination of the collectability of amounts due from customer accounts requires the company to make judgments regarding future events and trends 
allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on a continuous process of assessing the company s portfolio on an individual customer basis taking into account current market conditions and trends 
this process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience  current aging status of the customer accounts  and financial condition of the company s customers 
based on a review of these factors  the company will establish or adjust allowances for specific customers 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues come from international oil companies  international shipyards  international oilfield service companies  and government owned or government controlled oil companies 
therefore  the company has significant receivables in many foreign jurisdictions 
if worldwide oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions deteriorate  the creditworthiness of the company s customers could also deteriorate and they may be unable to pay these receivables  and additional allowances could be required 
at december  and  allowance for bad debts totaled million and million  or and of gross accounts receivable  respectively 
historically  the company s charge offs and provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts have been immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  because of the risk factors mentioned above  changes in our estimates could become material in future periods 

index to financial statements inventory reserves inventory is carried at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
the company determines reserves for inventory based on historical usage of inventory on hand  assumptions about future demand and market conditions  and estimates about potential alternative uses  which are usually limited 
the company s inventory consists of specialized spare parts  work in process  and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and the company s large installed base of specialized equipment used throughout the oilfield 
customers rely on the company to stock these specialized items to ensure that their equipment can be repaired and serviced in a timely manner 
the company s estimated carrying value of inventory therefore depends upon demand driven by oil and gas drilling and well remediation activity  which depends in turn upon oil and gas prices  the general outlook for economic growth worldwide  available financing for the company s customers  political stability in major oil and gas producing areas  and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell  among other factors 
at december  and  inventory reserves totaled million and million  or and of gross inventory  respectively 
while inventory reserves and accruals have not had a material impact on the company s financial results for the periods covered in this report  changes in worldwide oil and gas activity  or the development of new technologies which make older drilling technologies obsolete  could require the company to record additional allowances to reduce the value of its inventory 
such changes in our estimates could be material under weaker market conditions or outlook 
impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment and identified intangible assets  comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and estimated useful lives 
the carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
we estimate the fair value of these intangible and fixed assets using an income approach 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
the forecasts are dependent upon assumptions regarding oil and gas prices  the general outlook for economic growth worldwide  available financing for the company s customers  political stability in major oil and gas producing areas  and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell  among other factors 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our income forecast as well as our weighted average cost of capital  both key assumptions used in our calculation 
changes to these assumptions  including  but not limited to sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts forecasts  collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas  significant deterioration of external financing for our customers  higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity  or any other significant adverse economic news could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the company has approximately billion of goodwill and billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of december  generally accepted accounting principles require the company to test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include  but not limited to further sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts forecasts  further collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas  significant additional deterioration of external financing for our customers  higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity 
the annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each year 
based on its analysis  the company did not report any impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for the years ended december  and as described below  the company concluded that an indicator of impairment occurred in the second quarter of and updated its impairment testing at june  based on its updated analysis  the company concluded that it did not incur an impairment of goodwill for the period ended june  however  based on the company s indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of  the company concluded that it incurred an impairment charge to certain indefinite lived intangible assets of million at june  the million impairment charge is included in the company s consolidated income statement for the year ended december  
index to financial statements during the second quarter of  the worldwide average rig count was  rigs  down from the fourth quarter average of  and down from the first quarter average of  the second quarter average rig count represented the lowest quarterly average in the past six years 
in addition  the company s updated forecast was behind the company s previous forecast completed at the beginning of while operating profit for the first quarter of was in line with the company s first quarter operating profit forecast  the company s consolidated operating profit for the second quarter of was below its second quarter forecast 
as a result of the substantial decline in the worldwide rig count  and the decline in actual forecasted results compared to the original forecast  the company concluded that events or circumstances had occurred indicating that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired as described under accounting standards codification asc topic intangibles goodwill and other 
therefore  the company performed its interim impairment test of goodwill for all its reporting units at the end of the second quarter of the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of that reporting unit as a whole 
fair value of the reporting units is determined in accordance with asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures using significant unobservable inputs  or level in the fair value hierarchy 
these inputs are based on internal management estimates  forecasts and judgments  using a combination of three methods discounted cash flow  comparable companies  and representative transactions 
while the company primarily uses the discounted cash flow method to assess fair value  the company uses the comparable companies and representative transaction methods to validate the discounted cash flow analysis and further support management s expectations  where possible 
the discounted cash flow is based on management s short term and long term forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit 
the two main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment  which bear the risk of change and could impact the company s goodwill impairment analysis  include the cash flow from operations from each of the company s individual business units and the weighted average cost of capital 
the starting point for each of the reporting unit s cash flow from operations is the detailed annual plan or updated forecast 
the detailed planning and forecasting process takes into consideration a multitude of factors including worldwide rig activity  inflationary forces  pricing strategies  customer analysis  operational issues  competitor analysis  capital spending requirements  working capital needs  customer needs to replace aging equipment  increased complexity of drilling  new technology  and existing backlog among other items which impact the individual reporting unit projections 
cash flows beyond the specific operating plans were estimated using a terminal value calculation  which incorporated historical and forecasted financial cyclical trends for each reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate 
during times of volatility  significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit changes are a short term or long term trend 
projections for the remainder of also reflected declines compared to the original annual forecast 
the company updated its operating forecast  long term forecast  and discounted cash flows based on this information 
the goodwill impairment analysis that we performed during the second quarter of did not result in goodwill impairment as of june  other indefinite lived intangible assets  representing trade names management intends to use indefinitely  were valued using significant unobservable inputs level and are tested for impairment using the relief from royalty method  a form of the income approach 
an impairment is measured and recognized based on the amount the book value of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds its estimated fair value as of the date of the impairment test 
included in the impairment test are assumptions  for each trade name  regarding the related revenue streams attributable to the trade names which are determined consistent with the forecasting process described above  the royalty rate  and the discount rate applied 
based on the company s indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of  the company incurred an impairment charge of million in the petroleum services supplies segment related to a partial impairment of the company s grant prideco trade name 
the impairment charge was primarily the result of the substantial decline in worldwide rig counts through june  declines in forecasts in rig activity for the remainder of   and compared to rig count forecast at the beginning of and a decline in the revenue forecast for the drill pipe business unit for the remainder of   and during the fourth quarter of  the company further updated its impairment testing using current operating forecasts and discounted cash flows 
in the third and fourth quarters of  both rig activity and commodity prices began to increase 
rig count increased to an average of  in the third quarter and increased another to an average of  in the fourth quarter 
average west texas intermediate crude prices reached in the fourth quarter of  an increase of from an average of in the second quarter of in addition  by the end of the fourth quarter  average natural gas prices increased to  a increase from the second quarter average of 
the company performed its annual impairment analysis for its goodwill and indefinite lived assets during the fourth quarter of and resulting in no impairment 
the valuation techniques used in the annual test were consistent with those used during previous testing 
the inputs used in the annual test were updated for current market conditions and forecasts 

index to financial statements along with the normal impairment analysis  the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the projected results  the goodwill and the other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis assuming revenue for each individual reporting unit for goodwill and each individual indefinite lived intangible asset decreased an additional from the current projections for and  while holding all other factors constant and no impairment was identified 
additionally  if the company were to increase its discount rate basis points  while keeping all other assumptions constant  there would be no impairments in any of the goodwill associated with the company s reporting units or any of the company s indefinite lived intangible assets 
while the company does not believe that these events drop in additional revenue for the next three years or basis point increases in weighted average costs of capital or changes are likely to occur  it is reasonably possible these events could transpire if market conditions worsen and if the market fails to continue to recover in any significant changes to these assumptions and factors could have a material impact on the company s goodwill impairment analysis 
service and product warranties the company provides service and warranty policies on certain of its products 
the company accrues liabilities under service and warranty policies based upon specific claims and a review of historical warranty and service claim experience in accordance with asc topic contingencies asc topic 
adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience change

income taxes the company is a us registered company and is subject to income taxes in the us the company operates through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world 
income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates of the countries in which the company operates and income is earned 
the company s annual tax provision is based on taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
the determination and evaluation of the annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction could impact the tax liability in any given year 
the company also operates in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the pricing of transactions between related parties are open to interpretation  which could potentially result in aggressive tax authorities asserting additional tax liabilities with no offsetting tax recovery in other countries

the company is subject to audits by federal  state and foreign jurisdictions which may result in proposed assessments 
the company believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures under the guidance in asc topic income taxes asc topic 
however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the company reviews these liabilities quarterly and to the extent audits or other events result in an adjustment to the liability accrued for a prior year  the effect will be recognized in the period of the event 
the company currently has recorded valuation allowances that the company intends to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized 
income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in the company s valuation allowances 
the realization of remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income 
any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that the company record an additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on future earnings 
the company has not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested 
should the company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  the company may be required to record additional taxes 
unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries were  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the company makes a determination each period whether to permanently reinvest these earnings 
if  as a result of these reassessments  the company distributes these earnings in the future  additional tax liabilities would result  offset by any available foreign tax credits

index to financial statements item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
additional information concerning each of these matters follows foreign currency exchange rates we have extensive operations in foreign countries 
the net assets and liabilities of these operations are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  although such fluctuations generally do not affect income since their functional currency is typically the local currency 
these operations also have net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency  which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that impact income 
during the years ended december   and  the company reported foreign currency losses of million  million and million  respectively 
gains and losses are primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and adjustments to our hedged positions as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
strengthening of currencies against the us dollar may create losses in future periods to the extent we maintain net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the countries using the local currency as their functional currency 
some of our revenues in foreign countries are denominated in us dollars  and therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our earnings to the extent that costs associated with those us dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency 
similarly some of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies  but have associated us dollar costs  which also give rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
in order to mitigate that risk  we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the currency of our revenues and associated costs 
we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes

index to financial statements the company had other financial market risk sensitive instruments denominated in foreign currencies for transactional exposures totaling million and translation exposures totaling million as of december  excluding trade receivables and payables  which approximate fair value 
these market risk sensitive instruments consisted of cash balances and overdraft facilities 
the company estimates that a hypothetical movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates on the transactional exposures financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect net income by million and the transactional exposures financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect the future fair value by million 
the counterparties to forward contracts are major financial institutions 
the credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis 
in the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract  our exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential 
during the first quarter of  the venezuelan government officially devalued the venezuelan bolivar against the us dollar 
as a result the company converted its venezuela ledgers to us dollar functional currency  devalued monetary assets resulting in a million charge  and wrote down certain accounts receivable in view of deteriorating business conditions in venezuela  resulting in an additional million charge 
the company s net investment in venezuela was million at december  interest rate risk at december  our long term borrowings consisted of million in senior notes  million in senior notes and million in senior notes 
we occasionally have borrowings under our credit facility  and a portion of these borrowings could be denominated in multiple currencies which could expose us to market risk with exchange rate movements 
these instruments carry interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from either libor  nibor or euribor  or at the prime interest rate 
under our credit facility  we may  at our option  fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over libor  nibor or euribor for days to six months
