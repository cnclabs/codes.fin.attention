the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to increased billings in the pharmaceutical million  professional million and retail million markets 
these increases in billings were partially offset by decreased billings in the us government contract million  core government million and other million markets 
the increase in the pharmaceutical market billings is due to the timing of customer orders including the launch of three new patient support programs announced in august and october and resupply orders for existing patient support programs 
the programs include the direct fulfillment of the sharps recovery system to the pharmaceutical manufacturers program participants which provides the proper containment  return and treatment of the needles or injection devices utilized in therapy

recent data from the human capital management services group indicates that the number of used needles improperly disposed of outside the large healthcare setting and into the solid waste system has tripled over the past ten years to billion each year and the number of self injectors in the country has increased to million over the same period 
the company estimates that it would require over million sharps recovery system formerly sharps disposal by mail system products to properly dispose of all such syringes  which would equate to a market opportunity of over billion 
there are an estimated  doctors  dentists  veterinarians  clinics  tattoo parlors and other businesses in the country that generate smaller quantities of medical waste  including used syringes 
these offices and facilities  which must demonstrate proper management of their medical waste  comprise a market opportunity of approximately million  based on estimates of using our solution offerings rather than the traditional pick up service in what we characterize as a regulated market

approximately three years ago  the company supplemented the treatment facility s existing incineration process with an autoclave system and technology capable of treating up to seven tons per day of medical waste at the same facility 
autoclaving is a cost effective alternative to traditional incineration that treats medical waste with steam at high temperature and pressure to kill pathogens 
the autoclave system is utilized alongside the incinerator for day to day operations 
the autoclave system is not impacted by the epa amended clean air act discussed below 
we believe that our facility is one of only ten permitted commercial facilities in the united states capable of treating all types of medical waste  used healthcare materials and unused or expired dispensed medications ie  both incineration and autoclave capabilities 
in november and september  the epa and the texas commission on environmental quality promulgated new regulations under the clean air act and associated state statutes which will affect the incineration portion of our operation of the treatment facility located in carthage  texas 
these regulations modify the emission limits and monitoring procedures required to operate an incineration facility 
these new regulations and the recent receipt of a title v permit require additional emissions related monitoring and compliance by the end of calendar year such changes will require the company to incur capital expenditures in order to meet the requirements of the new regulations 
we believe the capital expenditures will be in the range of  to  and we expect to incur the costs during the first and second quarters of fiscal year inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the past three years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in fiscal year and beyond 

table of contents critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered  and title and risk of loss pass to the customer except for those sales via multiple deliverable arrangements 
provisions for certain rebates  product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded 
product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct  indirect and other market participants  as well as market conditions  including prices charged by competitors 
rebates are estimated based on contractual terms  historical experience  trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with guidance on revenue recognition of multiple element arrangements 
on july   the company adopted asu no 
which further clarifies guidance on revenue recognition for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  changing the way it allocated arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting 
under this guidance  certain products offered by the company have revenue producing components that are recognized over multiple delivery points sharps recovery system formerly the sharps disposal by mail systems and various takeaway environmental return system referred to as mailbacks and sharps pump and asset return boxes  referred to as pump returns and can consist of up to three separate elements  or units of measure  as follows the sale of the compliance and container system  return transportation and treatment service 
prior to july   the individual fair value of the transportation and treatment services were determined by the sales price of the service offered by third parties  with the fair value of compliance and container being the residual value 
beginning july   under the relative selling price methodology  an estimated selling price is determined for all deliverables that qualify for separate units of accounting 
the actual consideration received in a multiple deliverable arrangement is then allocated to the units based on their relative sales price 
because an estimated selling price must be set for each unit  the residual method used previously by the company to allocate consideration to the compliance and container system is no longer allowed 
the selling price for the transportation revenue and the treatment revenue  which utilized third party evidence  did not change from the prior method 
the company estimated the selling price of the compliance and container system based on the product and services provided including compliance with local  state and federal laws  adherence to stringent manufacturing and testing requirements  safety to the patient and the community as well as storage and containment capabilities 
revenue for the sale of the compliance and container is recognized upon delivery to the customer  at which time the customer takes title and assumes risk of ownership 
transportation revenue is recognized when the customer returns the compliance and container system and the container has been received at the company s facility 
the compliance and container system is mailed or delivered by an alternative logistics provider to the company s facility 
treatment revenue is recognized upon the destruction or conversion and proof of receipt and treatment having been performed on the container 
since the transportation element and the treatment elements are undelivered services at the point of initial sale of the compliance and container  transportation and treatment revenue is deferred until the services are performed 
the current and long term portions of deferred revenues are determined through regression analysis and historical trends 
furthermore  through regression analysis of historical data  the company has determined that a certain percentage of all compliance and container systems sold may not be returned 
accordingly  a portion of the transportation and treatment elements are recognized at the point of sale 
the company has calculated the change in revenue assigned to each of the units of accounting under the relative selling price methodology as compared to using the residual allocation method and determined that the change is not material 
the company has determined that the implementation of asu no 
did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements when compared to its previous revenue recognition methodology 
income taxes the liability method is used in accounting for deferred income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the establishment of valuation allowances and development of projected annual effective tax rates requires significant judgment and is impacted by various estimates 
both positive and negative evidence  as well as the objectivity and verifiability of that evidence  is considered in determining the appropriateness of recording a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets
