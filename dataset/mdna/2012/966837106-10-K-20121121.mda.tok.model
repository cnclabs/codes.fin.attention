the company s average weekly sales and gross profit are typically highest in the second and third fiscal quarters  and lowest in the fourth fiscal quarter

identical store sales exclude sales from relocated stores and remodeled stores with major expansions of square footage greater than from the comparable calculation to reduce the impact of square footage growth on the comparison 
stores closed for eight or more days are excluded from the comparable and identical store base from the first fiscal week of closure until re opened for a full fiscal week

sales sales totaled approximately billion  billion and billion in fiscal years  and  respectively  representing increases of  and over the previous fiscal years  respectively

table of contents comparable stores  relocated stores and remodels excluded from the identical store base  identical stores  and stores open less than one fiscal year were as follows comparable stores relocated stores remodels with major expansions identical stores stores open less than one fiscal year we believe our efforts around value and differentiation continue to be a significant contributor to our momentum 
our customers have shifted their buying toward branded and organic products  higher priced tiers  and to several discretionary categories 
with the moderation of inflation  we saw our identical store sales breakout move toward approximately transaction count and basket size 
during fiscal year  our transaction count in identical stores increased  continuing to accelerate from the increase we experienced in fiscal year the increase in transaction growth helped to offset the slower increase in basket size year over year 
basket size is partially impacted by our growth in new customers  who tend to have a smaller average basket size

net lifo inventory reserves increased approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
during fiscal year  net lifo inventory reserves decreased approximately million due primarily to lower average inventory balances and net deflation in product costs 
moderation of inflation during the fiscal year ended september  resulted in an almost flat net lifo inventory reserve  as compared to rising product costs in the prior year 
excluding the lifo charge  gross profit increased basis points  driven by improvement in occupancy costs and costs of goods sold 
during fiscal year  despite the basis point impact from the lifo charge  the company maintained healthy gross margins by balancing rising product costs while maintaining our relative value position 
the company realized sequentially lower cost of goods sold during fiscal year by taking advantage of buying opportunities and improving our distribution  shrink control and inventory management 
we have maintained our commitment to offering highly competitive prices on known value items in addition to implementing targeted pricing and promotional strategies 
the success of this ongoing strategy is reflected in our continued sales momentum and the results from our most recent competitive survey 
the survey indicates we dramatically improved our pricing position versus our competitors during fiscal year  resulting in our most competitive position in more than three years 
to the extent changes in costs are not reflected in changes in retail prices or changes in retail prices are delayed  our gross profit will be affected 
our gross profit may increase or decrease slightly depending on the mix of sales from new stores or the impact of commodity costs or a host of other factors  including possible supply shortages  and extreme weather related disruptions 
relative to existing stores  gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature  reflecting lower shrink as volumes increase  as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams 
direct store expenses direct store expenses totaled approximately billion  billion and billion in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the basis point decrease in direct store expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal year primarily reflects leverage of basis points in wages  basis points in depreciation expense  and basis points in healthcare costs 
during fiscal year  the basis point decrease in direct store expenses as a percentage of sales primarily reflects leverage of basis points in wages and basis points in depreciation expense  partially offset by an increase in costs  including worker s compensation expense of basis points as a percentage of sales
