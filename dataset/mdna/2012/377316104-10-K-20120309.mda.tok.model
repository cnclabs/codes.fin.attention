in  the items set forth above increased earnings by million  or per diluted share in business units results of individual business units are presented based on our management accounting practices and management structure 
there is no comprehensive  authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  therefore  the financial results of individual business units are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company 
the management accounting process uses assumptions and allocations to measure performance of the business units

cellulosic biofuel production credit in march  our application to be registered as a cellulosic biofuel producer was approved by the internal revenue service 
the us internal revenue code provides for a non refundable tax credit equal to per gallon for taxpayers that produce cellulosic biofuel 
on july   the irs office of chief counsel issued a memorandum which concluded that black liquor sold or used in a taxpayer s trade or business during calendar year  qualifies for the cellulosic biofuel producer credit cbpc 
accordingly  each gallon of black liquor we produced during calendar year qualifies for a non refundable cbpc of per gallon 
in connection with the filing of our income tax return  we claimed million  net of taxes  of cbpc  and as a result we received million of a cash tax refund subsequent to the end of the cbpc claimed is attributable to black liquor produced and burned from january  through february   after which we began mixing black liquor and diesel fuel to qualify for alternative fuel mixture credits 
in october  the irs issued further guidance concluding that both the alternative fuel mixture credit and the cellulosic biofuel production credit can be claimed in the same year  but only for different volumes of black liquor 
with respect to cbpc  although we do not intend to claim any additional credits  we could amend our federal tax return and claim additional credits 
if we were to elect to do so  we would be required to return cash already received from alternative fuel mixture credits  since we can only claim either the alternative fuel mixture credit or cbpc 
the ability to realize the value of any additional cbpc depends on future taxable income 
we continue to evaluate opportunities  if any  to claim additional cbpc from qualifying activities based on the results of our ongoing operations
