table of contents strategic and financial overview in  we initiated a diversification strategy in order to enter new higher growth markets and provide a more stable foundation from which to grow over the long term 
the benefits of this strategy were evident over the last two years as growth in our vascular access  orthopaedic and electrochem product lines offset the slowdown in our crm business 
as a result  sales increased and in and  respectively  despite flat crm neuromodulation revenue over that two year period 
further evidence of the benefits of this strategy was the reduction of crm neuromodulation revenue to of our total sales in  compared to in furthermore  with electrochem s acquisition of micro power in december  crm neuromodulation revenue is expected to comprise less than of total revenue in additionally  the concentration of sales to our top three customers in the crm market was reduced to of revenues in  versus for those same three customers in our goal is to reduce our concentration in the crm market to below one third of our revenue within the next five years 
simultaneous with the initiation of our growth and diversification strategy  we began evolving our company strategy to include the development of innovative medical devices in order to raise the growth and profitability profile of the company 
this medical device strategy is being facilitated through our qig group and leverages the component technology of greatbatch medical and electrochem 
investments in medical device products totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively  and included charges to selling  general and administrative expenses sg a and net research  development and engineering rd e 
as a result  sg a increased to of total sales in compared to in and rd e costs increased to of total sales in compared to in in  we began to see the financial benefit of these investments as the products that had shorter development lead times  primarily in the vascular access market  began to commercialize 
during  sales from medical devices that were developed under the greatbatch name totaled million and were the first medical device revenues in the year history of our company 
we expect the growth and cadence of new medical device product introductions to accelerate over the next several years as our longer lead time systems and device products  which we have invested in over the last four years  will also begin to commercialize 
we have a longstanding history of operational excellence  which is one of our core competencies 
as we move forward  investing in our operations will continue to be critical to the success of our growth and medical device strategies 
since  we have invested substantial resources in integrating our acquisitions and streamlining our operations 
the benefits of these initiatives can be seen in our improvement in adjusted operating income to million in from million in  which equates to compound annual growth and was achieved despite the significant increase in spending on research and development 
the benefits of these initiatives can also be seen in the substantial increase in our cash flow from operating activities during that time to million in from million in this strong cash flow helped to fund the repayment of debt  which totaled approximately million over the last three years 
our goal is to continuously improve operating margin over the next three to five years through our initiatives to improve operating performance and through the development of innovative products to drive future revenue growth  including medical device products 
consistent with this strategy  during  we began implementing a multi faceted plan to further expand  optimize and leverage our manufacturing infrastructure 
these initiatives will take the better part of and to complete  but once finished  will leave us with a more capable and cost effective orthopaedic operations and an infrastructure that will support the manufacturing of medical devices 
total capital investment in connection with these initiatives is expected to be between million and million with an additional million to million of expense 

table of contents to date  we have been successful in the implementation of all three facets of our strategy despite the macro economic challenges that we are facing 
our strategy has positioned our company for higher growth and profitability over the next several years and provides us multiple levers to achieve this growth 
namely  organic growth  growth through targeted acquisitions and growth through commercialization of our medical devices 
fundamental to this growth strategy will be our underlying core competency of sustaining operational excellence 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
additionally  we consistently report and discuss in our quarterly earnings releases and investor presentations adjusted operating income and margin  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share  which are non gaap measures 
these adjusted amounts consist of gaap amounts and  to the extent occurring during a period  excludes i acquisition related charges  ii facility consolidation  manufacturing transfer and system integration charges  iii asset write down and disposition charges  iv severance charges in connection with corporate realignments or a general reduction in force v litigation charges and gains  vi the impact of non cash charges to interest expense due to the accounting change governing convertible debt  vii unusual or infrequently occurring items  viii certain r d expenditures such as dvt expenses incurred in connection with the development of our neuromodulation platform  ix gain loss on the sale of investments and x the income tax benefit related to these adjustments 
we believe that reporting these amounts provides important supplemental information to our investors and creditors seeking to understand the financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  the performance based compensation of our executive management is determined utilizing these adjusted amounts 
a reconciliation of gaap operating income to adjusted operating income is as follows in thousands year ended december  december  january  operating income as reported adjustments inventory step up amortization cos executive death benefits sg a neuromodulation platform dvt expense rd e electrochem litigation charge gain intangible asset write down consolidation costs integration costs asset dispositions  severance and other operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted

for  we expect adjusted operating margin to be between and of sales 
this guidance assumes continued investment in medical device projects  as well as a lower mix of higher margin crm neuromodulation revenue 
adjusted operating income is expected to consist of gaap operating income less approximately million to million of adjustments  of which approximately million are non cash expenses 
consolidated annual sales for are projected to be approximately million to million 
this would equate to an increase of to over for  adjusted diluted eps is expected to be in the range of to per diluted share 
this would equate to an increase of to over adjusted diluted eps 
adjusted diluted eps is gaap diluted eps excluding the after tax impact of the adjusted amounts described above and million million net of tax of non cash convertible debt interest expense 
this guidance also assumes approximately million average diluted shares outstanding 

table of contents government regulation the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively health care reform legislated broad based changes to the us health care system that could significantly impact our business operations and financial results  including higher or lower revenue  as well as higher employee medical costs and taxes 
health care reform imposes significant new taxes on oems of medical devices  which will result in a significant increase in the tax burden on our industry and which could have a material  negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations and our cash flows 
other elements of health care reform such as comparative effectiveness research  an independent payment advisory board  payment system reforms including shared savings pilots and other provisions could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered  and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business  results of operations and financial condition 
many significant parts of health care reform will be phased in over the next seven years and require further guidance and clarification in the form of regulations 
as a result  many of the impacts of health care reform will not be known until those regulations are enacted 
since january  there have been various actions by the us congress and the us department of transportation  pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration to amend requirements in the hazardous materials regulations on the transportation of lithium cells and batteries  including lithium cells and batteries packed or contained in equipment 
if enacted  these actions could have negatively impacted our results of operations in the form of increased compliance costs for our lithium batteries 
on february   president obama signed into law the federal aviation administration modernization and reform act  which reconciles the nation s standards with global rules on the air shipment of lithium batteries  except for narrow exceptions 
as a result of this legislation  we do not expect any future us legislative or administrative actions regarding the transportation of lithium cells and batteries will materially impact our results of operations  unless current global standards are revised 
on december   the us securities and exchange commission sec issued a proposed rule under section of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
section relates to reporting requirements regarding conflict minerals originating in the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries 
under the proposed rule  issuers would be required to perform a reasonable due diligence process to ascertain whether conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of their manufactured or contracted to be manufactured products 
if conflict minerals are used  the issuer would be required to make certain disclosures in its annual report on form k 
we would incur additional  new compliance costs if the proposed rule is adopted since our greatbatch medical business utilizes some of the minerals specified in the proposed rule 
product development we continue to develop new component products for applications in our core markets  such as q power solutions qhr qmr  which maximize device performance and longevity with minimal size  qcaps which  when paired with qhr batteries  provides the smallest  longest lived  highest energy power solutions for tachycardia devices  orthopaedic capabilities in order to improve quality and shorten lead times  including the opening of additional regional development centers  minimally invasive surgical techniques for the orthopaedic industry  disposable instrumentation for the orthopaedic industry  and next generation power sources for electrochem s energy and portable medical customers 

table of contents as part of the natural evolution of our company  in  we reassigned greatbatch medical engineers to create the qig group in order to help facilitate the development of complete medical devices for our customers 
in creating qig  we pooled and focused the tremendous talent  resources and capacity for innovation within our organization 
today  qig encompasses research and development professionals working in facilities in five states and focused on three compelling therapeutic areas cardiovascular  neuromodulation and  longer term  orthopaedics 
additionally  qig has established relationships with nearly a dozen key physicians who are highly specialized in these areas 
these key opinion leaders are helping us to design medical devices from the ground up with features that will meet the needs of today s practicing clinicians 
within the qig group  we are utilizing a disciplined and diversified portfolio approach with three investment modes strategic equity investments in start up companies  oem customer discrete projects  and incubating new medical devices to be sold or licensed to an oem partner 
the qig group employs a disciplined and thorough process for evaluating these opportunities 
a scorecard process is utilized to review and select the most strategically valuable ideas to pursue  taking into account a host of variables including the market opportunity  regulatory pathway and reimbursement  market need and market potential  intellectual property and projected financial return 
as a result of the investments we have made  we are now able to provide our customers with complete medical devices 
this includes development and regulatory submissions  as well as manufacturing and supporting worldwide distribution 
these medical devices are full product solutions that complement our oem customers products and utilize the component expertise and capabilities residing within greatbatch medical and electrochem 
the benefits to our oem customers include shortening the time to market for these devices by accelerating the velocity of innovation  optimizing their supply chain and ultimately providing them with cost efficiencies 
we are currently in various stages of production or development on to medical devices  either through partnerships with our oem customers or independently 
while we do not discuss each of these projects individually each quarter  we will discuss significant milestones as they occur 
some of the medical device projects that we currently are working on include cardiovascular portfolio venous and arterial introducers  anti microbial coatings  steerable delivery systems  and mri conditional brady  gastric stimulation and sleep apnea leads 
during the first quarter of  we received fda k clearance on our transradial catheter sheath introducer and steerable delivery sheath for af ablation 
we expect sales of these medical devices to ramp up during the second half of neuromodulation portfolio algostim spinal cord stimulator for the treatment of chronic pain of the trunk and limbs 
we are in the final stages of development of this device and are half way through the design verification testing phase 
we are on track to make the applicable regulatory submissions on this device near the end of 
table of contents our critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
our most critical accounting estimates are described below 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
valuation of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets when we acquire a company  we allocate the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair value at the date of acquisition 
some of our intangible assets are considered non amortizing intangible assets as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely 
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill are not amortized but are required to be assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequent if certain indicators are present 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are assessed for impairment if certain indicators are present 
assumptions approach used we base the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined using one of three valuation approaches market  income or cost 
the selection of a particular method for a given asset depends on the reliability of available data and the nature of the asset 
the market approach values the asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets 
the income approach values the asset based on the present value of risk adjusted cash flows projected to be generated by that asset 
the projected cash flows for each asset considers multiple factors  including current revenue from existing customers  attrition trends  reasonable contract renewal assumptions from the perspective of a marketplace participant  and expected profit margins giving consideration to historical and expected margins 
the cost approach values the asset by determining the current cost of replacing that asset with another of equivalent economic utility 
the cost to replace the asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost  less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation or obsolescence  with specific consideration given to economic obsolescence if indicated 
we perform an annual review on the last day of each fiscal year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired 
we assess goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value to determine if there is potential impairment 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
fair values for reporting units are determined based on the income and market approaches 
indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment by using the income approach 
definite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if any conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life 

table of contents we do not believe that the indefinite lived intangible assets or goodwill allocated to our greatbatch medical or electrochem segments are at risk of failing step one of future annual impairment tests unless operating conditions significantly deteriorate  given the significant amount that our estimated fair value for these assets was in excess of their respective book values as of december  effect of variation of key assumptions used the use of alternative valuation assumptions  including estimated cash flows and discount rates  and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different purchase price allocations 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could impact the value of the assets and liabilities recorded  which would change the amount and timing of future intangible asset amortization expense 
we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the expected future cash flows of our reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing 
these include discount rates  terminal values and projections of future revenues and expenses 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could create future impairment losses to our goodwill 
the assumptions used in our impairment test incorporate growth rates disclosed in sales outlook of this section as well as other forward looking statements made in this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section 
for our indefinite lived intangible assets  we make estimates of royalty rates  future revenues and discount rates 
significant changes in these estimates could create future impairments of these assets 
estimation of the useful lives of indefinite and definite lived intangible assets is based upon the estimated cash flows of the respective intangible asset and requires significant management judgment 
events could occur that would materially affect our estimates of the useful lives 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could change the amount of future amortization expense or could create future impairments of these intangible assets 
as of december   we have million of intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet representing of total assets 
this includes million of amortizing intangible assets  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of goodwill 
a change in the amortization of our intangible assets would change net income by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
stock based compensation we record compensation costs related to our stock based awards which include stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units 
we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
compensation cost for service based awards is recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period 
compensation cost for performance awards based on company financial metrics is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance targets will be achieved 
compensation cost for performance awards based on market metrics such as total shareholder return is expensed each period whether the performance metrics are achieved or not 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest  as well as market and nonmarket performance award considerations 
the total expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that ultimately vest  as well as market and nonmarket performance award considerations 

table of contents assumptions approach used we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
we are required to make certain assumptions with respect to selected black scholes model inputs  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the stock options 
the expected life of stock options granted  which represents the period of time that the stock options are expected to be outstanding  is based  primarily  on historical data 
the expected dividend yield is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected life 
the fair value of time based as well as nonmarket based performance restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is equal to the fair value of the company s stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of market based performance restricted stock unit awards is determined by utilizing a monte carlo simulation model  which projects the value of greatbatch stock versus our peer group under numerous scenarios and determines the value of the award based upon the present value of these projected outcomes 
compensation cost for nonmarket based performance awards is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance targets will be achieved 
that assessment is based upon actual and expected future performance 
stock based compensation expense is only recorded for those awards that are expected to vest  as well as market and nonmarket performance award considerations 
forfeiture estimates for determining appropriate stock based compensation expense are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and demographic characteristics 
revisions are made to those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures 
effect of variation of key assumptions used option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  existing valuation models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
there are significant differences among valuation models 
this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved in selecting assumptions to be utilized to determine fair value and forfeiture assumptions 
if factors change and result in different assumptions in future periods  the expense that we record for future grants may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
additionally  changes in performance of the company and its stock price will affect the likelihood that performance based targets are achieved and could materially impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized 

table of contents a change in our stock based compensation expense would increase decrease net income by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out method  or market 
assumptions approach used inventory costing requires complex calculations that include assumptions for overhead absorption  scrap  sample calculations  manufacturing yield estimates and the determination of which costs may be capitalized 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory  as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality 
effect of variation of key assumptions used variations in methods or assumptions could have a material impact on our results 
if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs or expense a greater amount of overhead costs  which would have a negative impact on our net income 
as of december   we have million of inventory recorded on our balance sheet representing of total assets 
a write down of our inventory would decrease net income by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
tangible long lived assets property  plant and equipment and other tangible long lived assets are carried at cost 
the cost of property  plant and equipment is charged to depreciation expense over the estimated life of the operating assets primarily using straight line rates 
tangible long lived assets are subject to impairment assessment if certain indicators are present 
assumptions approach used we assess the impairment of tangible long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset asset group may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include  but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market price of the asset asset group  a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset asset group is being used or in its physical condition  a significant change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset asset group  including an action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset asset group  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recoverability potential is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset asset group to the related total future undiscounted cash flows 
the projected cash flows for each asset asset group considers multiple factors  including current revenue from existing customers  proceeds from the sale of the asset asset group  reasonable contract renewal assumptions  and expected profit margins giving consideration to historical and expected margins 
if an asset s assets group s carrying value is not recoverable through 
table of contents related cash flows  the asset asset group is considered to be impaired 
impairment is measured by comparing the asset s asset group s carrying amount to its fair value 
when it is determined that useful lives of assets are shorter than originally estimated  and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets  we accelerate the rate of depreciation in order to fully depreciate the assets over their shorter useful lives 
effect of variation of key assumptions used estimation of the useful lives of tangible assets that are long lived requires significant management judgment 
events could occur  including changes in cash flow that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation 
unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter the assumptions regarding the ability to realize the return of our investment in long lived assets 
also  as we make manufacturing process conversions and other facility consolidation decisions  we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of our assets  primarily manufacturing equipment and buildings 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could change the amount of future depreciation expense or could create future impairments of these long lived assets asset groups 
as of december  we have million of tangible long lived assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet representing of total assets 
a write down in our tangible long lived assets would decrease net income by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
provision for income taxes our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes for the expected future tax consequences of net operating losses  credits  and temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
assumptions approach used in relation to recording the provision for income taxes  management must estimate the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of temporary differences based upon the timing of expected reversal 
also  estimates are made as to whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for income taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
alternatively  we may make estimates about the potential usage of deferred tax assets that decrease our valuation allowances 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when we believe that certain tax positions do not meet the more likely than not threshold 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of a tax audit or the lapse of statutes of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate 

table of contents effect of variation of key assumptions used changes could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes 
changes in current tax laws and tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  thereby changing the income tax provision 
also  significant declines in taxable income could materially impact the realizable value of deferred tax assets 
at december   we had million of gross deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet and a valuation allowance of million has been established for certain deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
a percentage point change in the effective tax rate would impact the current year provision for income taxes by million  and diluted earnings per share by per diluted share 
cost savings and consolidation efforts in  and  we recorded charges in other operating expenses  net in the consolidated statements of operations in connection with various cost savings and consolidation initiatives 
these initiatives were undertaken to improve our operational efficiencies and profitability 
additional information regarding the timing  cash flow and amount of future expenditures is set forth in note other operating expenses  net of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
in  we began construction on an  square foot manufacturing facility in allen county  in  which is expected to be completed by mid in  we also initiated a multi faceted plan to further enhance  optimize and leverage our orthopaedics operations 
this plan includes the opening of two orthopaedic design centers  transferring production of certain orthopaedic product lines to other lower cost manufacturing facilities and the consolidation of our orthopaedic operations in switzerland into a new facility 
as part of the switzerland consolidation  a letter of intent was received from the canton of bern for a new tax holiday  which is contingent on the purchase or construction of a new facility 
if the new tax holiday is granted  we believe it will positively impact our effective tax rate 
these initiatives are expected to be completed over the next two to three years 
total capital investment under these initiatives is expected to be between million and million of which approximately million has been incurred to date 
total expenses expected to be incurred on these projects is between million to million of which approximately million has been incurred to date 
near the end of  we initiated plans to upgrade and expand our manufacturing infrastructure in order to support our medical device strategy 
this will include expansion of two of our existing facilities  the purchase of equipment  as well as the transfer of certain product lines to create additional capacity for the manufacture of medical devices 
these initiatives are expected to be completed over the next two to three years 
total capital investment under these initiatives is expected to be between million to million of which approximately million has been incurred to date 
total expenses expected to be incurred on these projects is between million to million of which none has been incurred to date 
we expect the above initiatives to generate approximately million to million of annual cost savings  which is expected to fund the increased infrastructure costs also associated with these initiatives 
in  we initiated plans to upgrade our existing global erp system 
this initiative is expected to be completed over the next two years 
total capital investment and expense to be incurred under this initiative is approximately million of which approximately half is to be expensed and relates to consulting costs to be incurred during the implementation

as a result of these headwinds  we expect crm neuromodulation revenue for to be lower in the first half of but begin to rebound in the second half of the year as the crm market stabilizes 
full year vascular access sales increased over this increase was primarily attributable to growth in the underlying market and market share gains 
additionally  vascular access revenue for included approximately million from sales of medical devices that were developed under the greatbatch name  including sales of our optiseal valved peelable introducer which received fda clearance in for  approximately million of device sales were included within the crm neuromodulation product line

orthopaedic sales of million for were above  and included approximately million of favorable foreign currency exchange rate benefit 
excluding this benefit  sales increased organically over the prior year despite slower than expected underlying market growth 
these increases occurred across all of our orthopaedic products  which benefitted from customer product launches  as well as from market share gains during the quarter 
these market share gains are a result of the investments made over the last several years to expand capabilities  shorten lead times  and improve quality and on time delivery 
even though we have made significant improvements in this area  organic growth in will remain challenging given the weakness in the underlying healthcare markets and global economic headwinds

our customers have various inventory management  dual sourcing  and vertical integration initiatives  and the relative market share among oem manufacturers changes continuously 
additionally  we face pricing pressures from our customers and in particular our four largest oem customers upon which a significant portion of our sales is dependent 
these pressures have increased over the last several years due to the downturn in the global economy  and more specifically  the contracting crm market 
consequently  these and other factors will continue to significantly impact our sales

excluding the additional revenue provided by micro power  sales for increased on an organic basis 
during  electrochem revenue varied from quarter to quarter due to the timing of various customer inventory pulls 
for the full year  the increase in electrochem revenue was a result of an increased investment in sales and marketing  which resulted in market share gains and several new customer contracts  as well as continued strength in the energy markets 
sales outlook annual product line revenue growth rates are expected to be as follows crm neuromodulation to vascular access to orthopaedic to electrochem a approximately a percentage increase assuming full year micro power revenue in based upon these growth rates  consolidated annual sales for are projected to be approximately million to million for this would equate to an increase of to over given the underlying weakness in the healthcare markets  as well as the tough comparables versus the first and second quarters of  we currently expect revenue for greatbatch medical for the first half of to be below levels  but rebound in the second half of the year as the healthcare markets stabilize 
these growth projections may be impacted by a variety of factors including a continued softening in the healthcare markets  changes in pricing or exchange rates  changes in health care reimbursement policies  further dual sourcing vertical integration initiatives by our customers and other factors described in cautionary factors that may affect future results contained in item of this report

we cannot quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for these materials because of these requirements 
our results may be negatively impacted by an increase in the price of these critical raw materials 
this risk is partially mitigated as many of the supply agreements with our customers allow us to partially adjust prices for the impact of any raw material price increases and the supply agreements with our vendors have final one time buy clauses to meet a long term need
