item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations and estimates  and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position 
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in the sections entitled cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors appearing elsewhere in this report 
all financial and operating data presented are the results of continuing operations unless otherwise noted 
overview of our business we are an independent oil and gas company operating in the appalachian basin and the illinois basin 
in the appalachian basin  we are focused on our marcellus shale drilling projects and utica shale exploration 
in the illinois basin  in addition to our developmental conventional oil drilling  we are focused on the implementation of enhanced oil recovery on our properties 
we pursue a balanced growth strategy of pursuing our higher potential exploration drilling prospects and actively seeking to acquire complementary oil and natural gas properties 
we are headquartered in state college  pennsylvania  and have regional offices in bridgeport  illinois  butler  pennsylvania  seven fields  pennsylvania and carrolton  ohio 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of oil and gas 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demand  which is impacted by overall economic activity  weather  refinery or pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future oil and gas prices  and therefore  we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
in addition to production volumes and commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of oil and gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
during  we increased our proved reserves base by approximately  from bcfe at december  the primary contributing factor to this increase was our continued drilling success in the appalachian basin  where we drilled gross net wells which also resulted in an increase in production of 
amidst our successful drilling endeavors  we successfully drilled two successful test wells  one to the utica shale and one to the burkett shale  solidifying our belief that there are multiple producing zones underlying our acreage in butler county  pennsylvania 
we continued to increase our acreage position in the appalachian basin during  ending the year with approximately  gross  net acres under leasehold  which includes approximately  gross acres in ohio that we believe to be prospective for the liquids rich portion of the utica shale 
as of december   our acreage holdings prospective for liquids rich production accounted for approximately of our total net acreage 
through our acreage holdings and successful drilling operations we have been able to expand our available drilling inventory  which now includes bcfe in proved undeveloped reserves covering gross proved undeveloped drilling locations 
to prepare for our future growth  we have entered into various gathering  processing and sales agreements to ensure market capacity for our projected production 
in  we entered into a joint venture agreement with sumitomo 
in accordance with the agreement  we sold a non operated interest in our butler county  pennsylvania project area and sumitomo also agreed to lease an additional  acres in this project area 
the leasing arrangement was concluded during  consequently  the ownership percentages in the project area are approximately to us and to sumitomo 
in addition to our butler county  pennsylvania project area  we also sold a non operated interest in our joint 
table of contents venture area with williams discussed below and a non operated interest in undeveloped acreage in fayette and centre counties  pennsylvania 
at closing  we received approximately million in cash  which included a reimbursement for leasing expenses incurred subsequent to the effective date of september   in the amount of million  and a reimbursement for drilling related expenses incurred subsequent to the effective date in the amount of approximately million 
as a part of the joint venture agreement  sumitomo agreed to pay of our net drilling and completion expenses up to approximately million 
for additional information on the transaction with sumitomo  see note  business and oil and gas property acquisitions and dispositions  to our consolidated financial statements 
in  we entered into a joint venture agreement with williams 
in accordance with the agreement  we sold a working interest in certain oil and gas leases in centre  clearfield and westmoreland counties  pennsylvania through a drill to earn structure 
for williams to earn its interest they were required to bear of all costs and expenses incurred in the drilling and completion of all wells jointly drilled until such time williams had invested approximately million approximately million on behalf of us and million for williams share of the wells 
as of december   williams had completed its carry obligation and acquired their working interest 
subsequent to the joint venture agreement with sumitomo  the ownership percentages are approximately to williams  to us and to sumitomo 
for additional information on the transaction with williams  see note  business and oil and gas property acquisitions and dispositions  to our consolidated financial statements 
source of our revenue we generate our revenue primarily from the sale of crude oil to refining companies and natural gas to local distribution and pipeline companies 
our operating revenue before the effects of financial derivatives from these operations  and their relative percentages of our total revenue  consisted of the following of total of total of total sources of revenue in thousands revenue from oil sales revenue from natural gas sales revenue from ngl sales other total we have identified the impact of generally volatile commodity prices in the last several years as an important trend that we expect to affect our business in the future 
if commodity prices increase  we would expect not only an increase in revenue  but also in the competitive environment for quality drilling prospects  qualified geological and technical personnel and oil field services  including rig availability 
increasing competition in these areas would likely result in higher costs in these areas  and could result in unavailability of drilling rigs  thus affecting the profitability of our future operations 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future with larger competitors in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital 
in the event of a declining commodity price environment  our revenues would decrease and we would anticipate that the cost of materials and services would decrease as well  although at a slower rate 
decreasing oil or natural gas prices may also make some of our prospects uneconomical to drill 
principal components of our cost structure our operating and other expenses consist of the following production and lease operating expenses 
day to day costs incurred to bring hydrocarbons out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties 

table of contents such costs also include workovers  repairs to our oil and gas properties not covered by insurance  and various production taxes that are paid based upon rates set by federal  state  and local taxing authorities 
general and administrative expense 
overhead  including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff  costs of maintaining our headquarters and regional offices  costs of managing our production and development operations  audit and other professional fees  and legal compliance are included in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense includes non cash stock based compensation expense as part of employee compensation 
exploration expense 
geological and geophysical costs  seismic costs  delay rentals and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells  also known as dry holes 
interest 
we typically finance a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under our senior credit facility 
as a result  we incur substantial interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions 
we may continue to incur significant interest expense as we continue to grow 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion 
the systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to acquire  explore and develop natural gas and oil 
as a successful efforts company  we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition and development efforts and all successful exploration efforts  and apportion these costs to each unit of production through depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
this also includes the systematic  monthly accretion of the future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as platforms  wells  service assets  pipelines  and other facilities 
income taxes 
we are subject to state and federal income taxes but are currently not in a tax paying position for regular federal income taxes  primarily due to the current deductibility of intangible drilling costs idc 
we do pay some state income taxes where our idc deductions do not exceed our taxable income or where state income taxes are determined on another basis 
currently  all of our federal taxes are deferred  however  we have scheduled the timing of reversal of our deferred tax assets and believe we will use all of our net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
how we evaluate our operations our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance 
these measurements include ebitdax a non gaap measure  lease operating expenses per mcf equivalent mcfe  growth in our proved reserve base  and general and administrative expenses per mcfe 
the following table presents these metrics for continuing operations for each of the three years ended december   and performance measurements years ended december  ebitdax in thousands production cost per mcfe total estimated proved reserves bcfe g a per mcfe 
table of contents ebitdax ebitdax  a non gaap measure  means  for any period  the sum of net income for such period plus the following expenses  charges or income to the extent deducted from or added to net income in such period interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  unrealized losses from financial derivatives  exploration expenses and other non cash charges  minus all non cash income  including but not limited to  income from unrealized financial derivatives  added to net income 
ebitdax  as defined above  is used as a financial measure by our management team and by other users of our financial statements  such as our commercial bank lenders  to analyze such things as our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to those of other companies in our industry  without regard to financial or capital structure  the financial performance of our assets and valuation of the entity  without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
for a definition of ebitdax and a reconciliation to its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  please see non gaap financial measures 
production cost per mcfe production costs are comprised of those expenses which are directly attributable to our producing oil and gas leases  including state and county production taxes  production related insurance  the cost of materials  maintenance  electricity  chemicals  gathering  processing  fuel and the wages of our field personnel 
our production costs per mcfe are higher than those of many of our peers primarily because of the nature of our oil properties  many of which are mature waterflood properties 
our production cost per mcfe produced in was as compared to in and in as we continue to develop our non proved properties  such as the marcellus shale  which have a lower operating cost  we believe this metric will continue to decrease on a per unit basis 
growth in our proved reserve base we measure our ability to grow our estimated proved reserves over the amount of our total annual production 
as we produce oil and gas attributable to our estimated proved reserves  our estimated proved reserves decrease each year by that amount of production 
we attempt to replace these produced estimated proved reserves each year through the addition of new estimated proved reserves through our drilling and other property improvement projects and through acquisitions 
our estimated proved reserves have fluctuated since  from bcfe at year end to bcfe at year end to bcfe at year end our reserve replacement ratio for year end was approximately based on total production for the year of bcfe and extensions  discoveries and other additions of bcfe 
our reserve replacement ratio for year end was approximately  based on total production for the year of bcfe  and extensions  discoveries and other additions of bcfe 
our reserve replacement ratio for year end was approximately  based on total production for the year of bcfe  and extensions  discoveries and other additions of bcfe 
our estimated proved reserve base increased in when compared to predominately due to our successful drilling and exploration programs in the marcellus shale and the increase in oil prices used for the reserves determination 
as of december   we removed all proved undeveloped locations related to our conventional drilling opportunities in the illinois and appalachian basins from our proved reserve totals  which 
table of contents is in compliance with sec rules requiring a high degree of confidence that the quantities related to proved undeveloped reserves will be recovered and they are scheduled to be drilled within the next five years 
for  our proved reserve base in the marcellus shale increased by approximately  while our estimated proved reserves in the illinois basin increased by 
general and administrative expenses per mcfe our general and administrative expenses include fees for well operating services  marketing  non field level employee compensation and related benefits  office and lease expenses  insurance costs and professional fees  as well as other costs and expenses not directly related to field operations 
our management continually evaluates the level of our general and administrative expenses in relation to our production because these expenses have a direct impact on our profitability 
in our general and administrative expenses per mcfe produced decreased to from in and from in as we continue to develop our non proved properties  we believe this metric will continue to decrease on a per unit basis 
results of continuing operations general overview operating revenue increased for over this increase is primarily due to increased oil and gas production in each of our operating regions and higher oil and ngl prices  which were partially offset by lower natural gas prices 
for  total production increased to  mmcfe from  mmcfe in due to the continued success of our drilling programs  primarily in the marcellus shale 
operating expenses increased million in  or  as compared to operating expenses are primarily composed of production expenses  general and administrative expenses  gain loss on disposal of assets  exploration expenses  impairment of oil and gas properties and depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion expenses dd a 
the increases in operating expense were primarily due to the growth of our operations  particularly in butler county  pennsylvania where we are required to process our gas prior to entry into the sales line 
also contributing to the increase were impairment expenses  which were approximately million higher than in primarily due to the write down of our conventional natural gas properties in the appalachian basin 
approximately million of the increase was due to the gain on sale recognized as a result of the sumitomo transaction in comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  oil and gas revenue for the years ended december  and is summarized in the following table december  change oil and gas revenue in thousands oil sales revenue oil derivatives realized total oil revenue and derivatives realized gas sales revenue gas derivatives realized total gas revenue and derivatives realized total ngl revenue consolidated sales consolidated derivatives realized total oil and gas revenue and derivatives realized total mcfe production average realized price per mcfe  including the effects of derivatives

table of contents marcellus shale regions of the appalachian basin 
revenues earned by this joint venture  water solutions holdings  llc water solutions  of which we own  have been classified as other revenue and did not exist prior to production and lease operating expense increased approximately million  or  in from the increase is primarily due to processing and gathering fees incurred in our butler county  pennsylvania operating region 
we produce wet gas in this region  which requires processing before it can be sold 
as such  we jointly constructed a cryogenic gas processing plant for which we pay fees to have our gas transported and processed before sale 
we incurred approximately million in expenses related to processing and gathering during and approximately million in also contributing to our increased expenses was the growth of our appalachian basin operations  where we placed into service gross net wells in general and administrative expense of approximately million for increased approximately million  or  from the increase in general and administrative costs is attributable to legal expenses  severance wages and an overall increase in headcount 
we incurred million in legal costs associated with the settlement of our leasing lawsuit in westmoreland county  pennsylvania 
during  we entered into separation agreements with several employees for which we incurred approximately million in severance costs 
the remainder of the increase during is primarily attributable to our continued efforts to hire and retain high quality personnel 
we have incurred higher recruiting  wages and benefits costs to achieve this goal  which includes approximately million in non cash compensation in as compared to million in gain loss on disposal of assets for was a loss of approximately million as compared to a gain of million for from time to time  we sell or otherwise dispose of certain fixed assets and wells that are no longer effectively used by us  and a gain or loss may be recognized when such an asset is sold 
impairment expense increased to million in from million  or  in we evaluate impairment of our properties when events occur that indicate that the carrying value of these properties may not be recoverable 
during we incurred approximately million of impairment expense related to conventional shallow natural gas properties in the appalachian basin due to their estimated fair value being less than their carrying value as of december  these wells are characterized as older wells that produce at much lower rates than the unconventional shale plays 
while they are less capital intensive and have lower operating costs  their lower production levels combined with lower commodity pricing make them susceptible to impairment write downs 
the remainder of our impairment in was primarily due to the expiration of leased acreage 
during  impairment expense was primarily related to two test wells in clearfield county  pennsylvania 
we determined that the carrying value of these two test wells  which were in various stages of drilling and completion  was not recoverable due to a lack of a sales outlet and no then current plans by us to complete the wells for commercial production 
we periodically evaluate the capitalized costs associated with properties that are outside of our current scope of operations as to their recoverability based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in our business strategy 
as economic and strategic conditions change and we continue to develop unproved properties  our estimates of impairment will likely change and we may increase or decrease expense 
exploration expense of oil and gas properties for decreased approximately million from million in exploration costs incurred by us during and were primarily due to delay rental payments on undeveloped acreage and seismic and micro seismic activities on our properties 
depletion  depreciation  amortization and accretion expense of approximately million for increased approximately million  or  from depletion expenses incurred during were lower than what would normally be expected primarily due to the carry obligations by our joint venture partners  whereby our partners would fund the majority of the cost to drill and complete wells to earn their share of the working interest 
we expect future depletion to trend more in line with production as the carry obligations have been expended  pending any future carry obligations 

table of contents other operating expense for totaled approximately million 
these costs are comprised of operating expenses incurred in connection with water solutions 
water solutions is a subsidiary of which we own and fully consolidate the results of operations 
this entity did not have operating expense prior to interest expense  net of interest income  for was approximately million as compared to million for the increase in interest expense  net of interest income  was primarily due to a higher average outstanding balance on our senior credit facility 
gain loss on derivatives  net for was a gain of approximately million as compared to million for this change was attributable to the volatility of oil and gas commodity prices in the marketplace along with changes in our portfolio of outstanding collars and swap derivatives 
losses from derivative activities generally reflect higher oil and gas prices in the marketplace than were in effect at the time we entered into a derivative contract  while gains would suggest the opposite 
our derivative program is designed to provide us with greater predictability of future cash flows at expected levels of oil and gas production volumes given the highly volatile oil and gas commodities market 
net income loss attributable to rex energy for was a loss of approximately million  as compared to net income of approximately million for as a result of the factors discussed above

revenues earned by water solutions were classified as other revenue in and did not exist prior to production and lease operating expense increased approximately million  or  in from the increase in expense was primarily due to seasonal repair and maintenance work being performed in our illinois basin operations 
these repair and maintenance activities were delayed during due  in part  to 
table of contents periods of depressed oil prices during the year 
also contributing to our higher production expenses during the year was the continued expansion of our marcellus shale operations  where we began to incur costs to transport and process our natural gas in our butler county  pennsylvania project area 
lease operating expense per mcfe decreased approximately from to per mcfe in  which was the result of our increased production 
general and administrative expense of approximately million for increased approximately million  or  from these expenses increased from to primarily due to expenses recognized with respect to water solutions  for which we fully consolidate the results of operations

impairment expense increased to million in from million in we evaluate impairment of our properties when events occur that indicate that the carrying value of these properties may not be recoverable 
during  we determined that the carrying value of two of our test wells  which were in various stages of drilling and completion  in clearfield county  pennsylvania  were not recoverable due to a lack of a sales outlet and no then current plans by us to complete the wells for commercial production 
in addition  the capitalized costs associated with properties that are outside of our current scope of operations are periodically evaluated as to their recoverability based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in our business strategy

exploration expense of oil and gas properties for increased to approximately million from million in exploration costs incurred by us during and were primarily due to delay rental payments on undeveloped acreage and seismic and micro seismic activities on our properties 
depletion  depreciation  amortization and accretion expense of approximately million for decreased approximately million  or  from this decrease can be primarily explained by the upward revision in the estimated lives of our estimated proved reserves 
we calculate our depletion on a units of production basis  which decelerated in relation to our higher estimated proved reserves base 
other operating expense for totaled approximately million 
these costs were comprised of operating expenses incurred in connection with water solutions 
this entity did not have operating expense prior to interest expense  net of interest income  for was approximately million as compared to million for the increase in interest expense  net of interest income  was primarily due to our higher average outstanding balance on our senior credit facility 
gain loss on derivatives  net for was a gain of approximately million as compared to a loss of million for the change was attributed to the volatility of oil and gas commodity prices in the marketplace along with changes in our portfolio of outstanding collars and swap derivatives 
losses from derivative activities generally reflect higher oil and gas prices in the marketplace than were in effect at the time we entered into a derivative contract  while gains would suggest the opposite 
our derivative program is designed to provide us with greater reliability of future cash flows at expected levels of oil and gas production volumes given the highly volatile oil and gas commodities market 

table of contents other expense increased by million to approximately million in the increase in other expense was primarily attributable to expenses incurred in connection with ensuring the pipeline integrity of a gathering system contributed to our keystone midstream services  llc joint venture  of which we are the owner 
net income loss attributable to rex energy for was income of approximately million  as compared to a net loss of approximately million for as a result of the factors discussed above 
capital resources and liquidity our primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves 
during  million of capital  which excludes our joint venture investments  was expended on drilling projects  facilities and related equipment and acquisitions of unproved acreage 
the capital program was funded by net cash flow from operations and through borrowings on our senior credit facility and our second lien credit agreement 
our capital budget of million is expected to continue to be funded primarily by cash flow from operations  non core asset sales and borrowings under our credit agreements 
we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet our obligations for the next twelve months  however  a significant drop in commodity prices  particularly natural gas  or a reduction in production or reserves could adversely affect our ability to fund capital expenditures and meet our financial obligations 
also  our obligations may change due to acquisitions  divestitures and continued growth 
we may also elect to issue additional shares of stock  subordinated notes or other securities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  extend maturities or to repay debt 
on february   we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock  which included  shares of common stock issued upon the full exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds of the transaction are expected to be approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and estimated offering expense 
we have used the proceeds of the offering to repay borrowings under our senior credit facility 
our ability to fund our capital expenditure program is dependent upon the level of product prices and the success of our exploration program in replacing our existing oil and gas reserves 
if product prices decrease  our operating cash flow may decrease and the banks may require additional collateral or reduce our borrowing base  thus reducing funds available to fund our capital expenditure program 
the effects of product prices on cash flow can be mitigated through the use of commodity derivatives 
if we are unable to replace our oil and gas reserves through our acquisitions  development or exploration programs  we may also suffer a reduction in our operating cash flow and access to funds under the senior credit facility 
under extreme circumstances  product price reductions or exploration drilling failures could allow the banks to seek to foreclose on our oil and gas properties  thereby threatening our financial viability 
our cash flow from operations is driven by commodity prices and production volumes 
prices for oil and gas are driven by  among other things  seasonal influences of weather  national and international economic and political environments and  increasingly  from heightened demand for hydrocarbons from emerging nations 
our working capital is significantly influenced by changes in commodity prices  and significant declines in prices could decrease our exploration and development expenditures 
cash flows from operations and borrowings from our senior credit facility have been primarily used to fund exploration and development of our oil and gas interests 
as of december   we had million available for borrowing under our senior credit facility of million and million available for borrowing under our second lien credit agreement of million 
as of december   we were in compliance with all required debt covenants 
in addition  we have utilized two joint venture agreements with sumitomo and williams to supplement our capital outlay to assist in sustaining our growth prospects 
through the sumitomo pea  we received approximately million in cash in addition to approximately million in drilling expenses in our joint venture project areas 
as of december   sumitomo fulfilled its drilling carry obligation in full 
in addition to the drilling carry  sumitomo has also agreed to pay to us a management fee of per acre for leases acquired in our butler county  pennsylvania project area 

table of contents financial condition and cash flows for the years ended december   and the following table summarizes our sources and uses of funds for the periods noted for the years ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million in when compared to  to million 
this increase is primarily due to increased oil and natural gas production  in addition to higher crude oil prices as compared to partially offsetting these increases were higher production and g a costs 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately million in when compared to  to million 
in  cash flows decreased primarily due to the receipt of approximately million in related to the early settlement of certain oil derivatives that were originally scheduled to be settled in in addition  we experienced higher costs related to production and lease operating expenses and general and administrative expenses 
higher natural gas production partially offset these declines in operating cash flows 
net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately million in when compared to  to million 
approximately million of this increase is due to our growth and expansion during the year as we drilled  completed and placed into service wells in our appalachian basin region 
also contributing to the increase in net investing were lower proceeds on sale of assets of million during  which was primarily due to the sumitomo joint venture that occurred in net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately million in when compared to  to million 
during  we decreased our normal development activities and increased our focus on more strategic projects  such as marcellus shale exploration 
during  our investment activity increased as we expanded our exploration of the marcellus shale in the appalachian basin and the niobrara formation in the dj basin 
partially offsetting our expenditures in were proceeds received upon the closing of our joint venture with sumitomo  where we received cash in exchange for a partial interest in wells  acreage and other equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by approximately million in when compared to  to million 
during  we increased our borrowings under our credit agreements by million and reduced repayments of debt by million 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by approximately million in when compared to  to million 
during  we received net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of approximately million 
this increase in cash flow was partially offset by net repayments of long term debt of approximately million in as compared to net proceeds in of approximately million 
effects of inflation and changes in price our results of operations and cash flows are affected by changing oil and natural gas prices 
if the price of oil and natural gas increases or decreases  there could be a corresponding increase or decrease in our operating costs  as well as an increase or decrease in revenues 
inflation has had a minimal effect on us 
critical accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
table of contents of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates include volumes of oil and natural gas reserves used in calculating depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties  future cash flows  asset retirement obligations  impairment when applicable of undeveloped properties  the collectability of outstanding accounts receivable  fair values of financial derivative instruments  contingencies and the results of current and future litigation 
oil and natural gas estimates  which are the basis for units of production depletion  have numerous inherent uncertainties 
the certainty of any reserve estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
subsequent drilling results  testing and production may justify revision of such estimates 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  reserve estimates are vulnerable to changes in wellhead prices of crude oil and natural gas 
these prices have been volatile in the past and are expected to be volatile in the future 
the significant estimates are based on current assumptions that may be materially affected by changes in future economic conditions such as the market prices received for sales of oil and natural gas  interest rates  and our ability to generate future income 
future changes in these assumptions may materially affect these significant estimates in the near term 
natural gas and oil reserve quantities our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that engineering and geological analyses demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
for the years ended december  and  netherland sewell and associates  inc nsai prepared a consolidated reserve and economic evaluation of our proved oil and gas reserves 
these engineers were selected for their geographic expertise and their historical experience in engineering certain properties 
the technical persons responsible for preparing the estimates of our proved reserves meet the requirements with regards to qualifications  independence  objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers 
our independent third party engineers do not own an interest in any of our properties and are not employed by us on a contingent basis 
the preparation of our proved reserve estimates are completed in accordance with our internal control procedures  which include the verification of input data used by nsai  as well as intense management review and approval 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
estimates of our crude oil and natural gas reserves  and the projected cash flows derived from these reserve estimates  are prepared by our engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the sec  including the rule revisions designed to modernize the oil and gas company reserves reporting requirements and which we adopted effective december  reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves 
the certainty of our reserve estimates is a function of many factors  including the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
any of the assumptions inherent in these factors could deviate significantly from actual results 
as such  reserve estimates may materially vary from the ultimate quantities of natural gas and oil eventually recovered 
the independent reserve engineer estimates reserves annually on december this annual estimate results in a new dd a rate  which we use for the preceding fourth quarter after adjusting for fourth quarter production 

table of contents derivative instruments we use put and call options collars  fixed rate swap contracts  swaptions  puts and put spreads to manage price risks in connection with the sale of oil and natural gas 
we have also  in the past  used interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risks associated with our variable rate credit facility 
we have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and other third party providers 
these values are based upon  among other things  future prices  volatility  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our consolidated financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors 
we report our derivative instruments at fair value and include them in the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
we do not designate our derivatives as hedging instruments  therefore  any changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings 
oil and natural gas property  depreciation and depletion we account for natural gas and oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting 
proved developed natural gas and oil property acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred 
unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed periodically on a property by property basis  and any impairment in value is recognized 
if the unproved properties are determined to be productive  the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved natural gas and oil properties 
natural gas and oil exploration costs  other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells  are charged to expense as incurred 
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves 
if proved commercial reserves are not discovered  such drilling costs are expensed 
costs to develop estimated proved reserves  including the costs of all development well and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and oil  are capitalized 
depletion is calculated using the unit of production method 
in arriving at rates under the unit of production method  the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas are established based on estimates made by our geologists and engineers and independent engineers 
we periodically review estimated proved reserve estimates and make changes as needed to depletion expenses to account for new wells drilled  acquisitions  divestitures and other events which may have caused significant changes in our estimated proved reserves 
the costs of unproved properties are withheld from the depletion base until such time as they are proved 
when estimated proved reserves are assigned  the cost of the property is added to costs subject to depletion calculations 
non producing properties consist of undeveloped leasehold costs and costs associated with the purchase of certain proved undeveloped reserves 
undeveloped leasehold cost is allocated to the associated producing properties as the undeveloped acreage is developed 
individually significant non producing properties are periodically assessed for impairment of value 
service properties  equipment and other assets are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of three to years 
when circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired  we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on our estimate of future natural gas and oil prices  operating costs  anticipated production from estimated proved reserves and other relevant data  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
when evaluating our unproved oil and gas properties  we utilize active market prices for similar acreage to use as a comparison tool against the carrying value of our properties 
if the active market prices for similar acreage do not support our carrying values we then utilize estimates of future value that will be created from the future development of these properties 
if future estimated fair value of these properties is lower than the capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to the estimated future fair value 
we recognized 
table of contents approximately million  million and million of impairment from continuing operations on certain oil and gas properties for the years ending december   and  respectively 
we recorded these charges as impairment expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
for additional information  see note  impairment expense  to our consolidated financial statements 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance to sustain production from the existing producing reservoir are charged to expense as incurred 
expenditures to recomplete a current well in a different unproved reservoir are capitalized pending determination that economic reserves have been added 
if the recompletion is not successful  the expenditures are charged to expense 
significant tangible equipment added or replaced that extends the useful or productive life of the property is capitalized 
expenditures to construct facilities or increase the productive capacity from existing reservoirs are capitalized 
upon the sale or retirement of a proved natural gas or oil property  or an entire interest in unproved leaseholds  the cost and related accumulated dd a are removed from the property accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized 
for sales of a partial interest in unproved leaseholds for cash or cash equivalents  sales proceeds are first applied as a reduction of the original cost of the entire interest in the property and any remaining proceeds are recognized as a gain 
deferred financing costs and other assets net at december   our intangible assets from continuing operations consisted of million  which is primarily made up of loan costs that are amortized using the straight line method over their respective estimated lives  which is  on average  three to five years 
we amortize any costs incurred to renew or extend the terms of existing intangible assets over the contract term or estimated useful life  as applicable  using the straight line method 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded amortization expense from continuing operations of million  million and million  respectively 
future abandonment cost future abandonment costs are recognized as obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition and development of the asset 
we recognize the fair value of a liability for a retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred 
for natural gas and oil properties  this is the period in which the natural gas or oil well is acquired or drilled 
the future abandonment cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of our natural gas and oil properties at its fair value 
the liability is then accreted each period until the liability is settled or the natural gas or oil well is sold  at which time the liability is reversed 
if the fair value of a recorded asset retirement obligation changes  a revision is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost 
deferred income taxes we are subject to income and other taxes in all areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because income tax returns are generally filed several months after the close of a calendar year  tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete  and future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized 
we have deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences 
we routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization 
a valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when we believe that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized 
we may be challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in our various income tax returns 
although we believe that we have adequately provided for all taxes  gains or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding tax matters 

table of contents contingent liabilities a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost or range of cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and contingent matters 
in addition  we often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  our judgment is based on the input of our legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or the courts 
we monitor known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters and make our best estimate of when to record losses for these matters based on available information 
we have recognized an accrued liability of approximately million at december  for the estimated cost of pending litigation matters 
stock based compensation we recognize in the consolidated financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
we use a standard option pricing model ie black scholes to measure the fair value of employee stock options and stock appreciation rights 
the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost are reported as a financing cash flow 
this requirement reduces net operating cash flows and increases net financing cash flows 
we recognize compensation costs related to awards with graded vesting on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award were  in substance  multiple awards 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
asu provides new disclosure requirements related to offsetting arrangements to allow investors to better compare financial statements prepared in accordance with ifrs and us gaap 
the amendment requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
an entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods  including retrospective application for all comparative periods presented 
although we currently are not engaged in any arrangements that would be effected by these disclosure requirements  we believe that asu may have a material impact on future disclosures pending our entrance into an offsetting arrangement 
in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
asu generally provides a uniform framework for fair value measurements and related disclosures between gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
additional disclosure requirements in the update include for level fair value measurements  quantitative information about unobservable inputs used  a description of the valuation process used by the entity  and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs  for an entity s use of a nonfinancial asset that is different from the asset s highest and best use  the reason for the difference  for financial instruments not measured at fair value but for which disclosure of fair value is required  the fair value hierarchy level in which the fair value measurements were determined  and the disclosures of all transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy 
this update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after december  we adopted asu on january   with no material impact 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued asu  disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations asu 
the amendments to the codification clarify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
additionally  the supplemental pro forma disclosures under topic have been expanded to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments in asu are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  although we have not entered into any significant business combinations in our recent history  we believe that asu may have a material impact on future disclosures depending on the size and nature of any future business combinations that we may enter into 
we adopted asu on january   with no material impact 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices our revenues  future rate of growth  results of operations  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  as well as the carrying value of our properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
we account for our natural gas and oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting for additional information  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements 
to mitigate some of our commodity price risk we engage periodically in certain other limited derivative activities  including price swaps and costless collars  to establish some price floor protection 
for the twelve month period ended december   the net realized gain on oil and natural gas derivatives was approximately million 
for the twelve month period ended december   the net realized gain on oil and natural gas derivatives was approximately million 
for the twelve month period ended december   the net unrealized gain on oil and natural gas derivatives was approximately million  as compared to a net unrealized gain of approximately million on oil and natural gas derivatives for the net unrealized gains and losses are reported as gain loss on derivatives  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
while the use of derivative arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit our ability to benefit from increases in the prices of oil and natural gas 
we enter into the majority of our derivative transactions with four counterparties and have a netting agreement in place with those counterparties 
we do not obtain collateral to support the agreements  but we believe our credit risk is currently minimal on these transactions 
under these arrangements  payments are received or made based on the differential between a fixed and a variable commodity price 
these agreements are settled in cash at expiration or exchanged for physical delivery contracts 
in the event of nonperformance  we would be exposed again to price risk 
we have additional risk of financial loss because the price received for the product at the actual physical delivery point may differ from the prevailing price at the delivery point required for settlement of the derivative transaction 
moreover  our derivative arrangements generally do not apply to all of our production  and thus provide only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices 
we expect that the amount of our derivatives will vary from time to time 
for a summary of our current oil and natural gas derivative positions at december   refer to note  fair value of financial instruments and derivative instruments  of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents contractual obligations in addition to our capital expenditure program  we are committed to making cash payments in the future on various types of contracts and obligations 
as of december   we do not have any off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place at december  in addition to the contractual obligations listed in the table below  our balance sheet at december  reflects accrued interest on our bank debt of million which was paid in january the following summarizes our contractual financial obligations for continuing operations at december  and their future maturities 
we expect to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities 
payment due by period in thousands thereafter total bank debt a operating leases other loans and notes payable leasing commitments derivative obligations b firm commitments c asset retirement obligations d total contractual obligations a due at termination date of respective facility 
interest paid on our bank credit facilities would be approximately million per year from through and million in assuming no change in the interest rate or outstanding balance 
b derivative obligations represent net open derivative contracts valued as of december  c includes sales  gathering and processing agreements 
d the ultimate settlement and timing cannot be precisely determined in advance 
interest rates at december   we had million of debt outstanding under our senior credit facility and second lien credit agreement 
this bears interest at floating rates  which averaged and on our senior credit facility and second lien credit agreement  respectively  at december  the day london interbank offered rate libor on december  was 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently use any off balance sheet arrangements to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position  or for any other purpose 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various risks  including energy commodity price risk 
we expect energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable 
if energy prices were to decrease for a substantial amount of time or decline significantly  revenues and cash flows would significantly decline  and our ability to borrow to finance our operations could be adversely impacted 
our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
conversely  increases in the market prices for oil and natural gas can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on december  reserve estimates  we project that a decline in the price per barrel of oil  price per barrel of ngls and the price per mcf of gas from average prices would reduce our gross revenues  before the effects of derivatives  for the year ending december  by approximately million 
we have designed our hedging policy to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets 
our risk management policy provides for the use of derivative instruments to manage these risks 
the types of derivative instruments that we use include swaps  collars  put spreads  put options  swaptions and three way collars 
the volume of derivative instruments that we may use are governed by the risk management policy and can vary from year to year  but under most circumstances will apply to only a portion of our current and anticipated production  and will provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices 
we are exposed to market risk on our open contracts  to the extent of changes in market prices of oil and natural gas 
however  the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged 
further  if our counterparties should default  this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges 
at december   the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding period volume put option floor ceiling swap fair market value in thousands oil collar  bbls collar  bbls  bbls  natural gas swap  mcf swaption  mcf collar  mcf way collar  mcf put  mcf swap  mcf collar  mcf way collar  mcf call  mcf  mcf  item a of regulation s k requires that tabular information relating to contract terms allow readers of the table to determine expected cash flows from the market risk sensitive instruments for each of the next five years 
at december   we had commodity derivative contracts in place for the next three years  relating to production through 
table of contents we are also exposed to market risk related to adverse changes in interest rates 
our interest rate risk exposure results primarily from fluctuations in short term rates  which are libor and prime rate based  as determined by our lenders  and may result in reductions of earnings or cash flows due to increases in the interest rates we pay on our obligations 
we have used  in the past  an interest rate swap agreement to manage risk associated with interest payments on amounts outstanding from variable rate borrowings under our senior credit facility 
under our interest rate swap agreement  we agreed to pay an amount equal to a specified rate of interest times a notional principal amount  and to receive in return  a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount 
this swap expired in november
