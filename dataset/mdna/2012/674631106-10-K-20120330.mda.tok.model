item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained herein as item overview we are principally engaged in the manufacturing  marketing and distribution of a broad line of appearance and maintenance products for boats  recreational vehicles  automobiles and home care under the star brite and other trademarks within the united states of america and canada 
in addition  we produce private label formulations of many of our products for various customers and provide custom blending and packaging services for these and other products 
we sell our products through national retailers and to national and regional distributors who  in turn  sell our products to specialized retail outlets 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates  which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition and collectability of accounts receivable revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of a contract exists  the sales price is fixed and determinable  the title of goods pass to the customer  and collectability of the related receivable is probable 
with respect to a customer for whom the company manages the inventory at the customer s location  revenue is recognized when the products are sold to a third party 
in the ordinary course of business  we grant non interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms 
in an effort to reduce our credit risk  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and customers creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience  specific customer collection issues and reviews of agings of trade receivables based on contractual terms 
we generally do not require collateral on trade accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable  considering the period an account is outstanding  the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services 
the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  at december  and approximately  at december   which was approximately and  respectively  of gross accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur  additional allowances may be required or bad debt expense may increase 
inventories inventories primarily are composed of raw materials and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
accordingly  we maintain a reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence  damage or other issues affecting marketability by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
in assessing historical usage  we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 
a complete physical count of the inventory is conducted annually 
our slow moving and obsolete inventory reserve was  and  at december  and december   respectively 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the temporary differences are attributable to differing methods of financial statement and income tax depreciation and reserves for trade accounts receivable and inventories 
the likelihood of a material change in the company s expected realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on  among other factors  future taxable income and settlements with tax authorities 
while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities  which could be material 
we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we evaluate positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events  including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
based on this assessment  we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized  in which case we would be required to apply a valuation allowance to offset our deferred tax assets in an amount equal to future tax benefits that may not be realized 
we currently do not apply a valuation allowance to our deferred tax assets 
however  if facts and circumstances change in the future  valuation allowances may be required 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold  which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
in the normal course of business  we and our subsidiaries are examined by various federal and state tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which facts that give rise to an adjustment become known 
the ultimate outcomes of the examinations of our income tax returns could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities  which could affect our financial results 
trademarks  trade names and patents we acquired the rights to the star brite trademark and related products for the united states and canada in conjunction with our original public offering during march for  the cost of these intangible assets was amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of years through december  effective january  and pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets now codified in financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic  intangibles goodwill and other  we determined that these intangible assets have indefinite lives and therefore  we no longer recognize amortization expense 
in addition  our owned joint venture  odorstar technology  llc  owns patents we use in our business 
the company amortizes these patents over their remaining life on a straight line basis 
we review the carrying values of the trademarks and patents periodically for possible impairment 
our impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume  revenue and expense growth rates  and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions 
all impairment charges would be recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows  which represents the estimated fair value of the asset 
management uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological change  distribution losses  or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired 
results of operations net sales increased to approximately  in from  in  an increase of  or 
the increase is a result of increased sales to new and existing customers of both our enzyme based fuel treatment products and recently introduced chlorine dioxide based products  as well as other products

selling administrative expenses increased by about  or  from approximately  in to approximately  in the increase is principally due to an increase in variable selling expenses  including sales commissions and sales related expenses 
in addition  administrative expenses in reflected the recovery of  of bad debt expense previously written off in and as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses decreased from in to in interest expense increased approximately  to  in  compared to  in the increase is a result of increased use of our line of credit to support higher levels of inventory

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was approximately  compared to  in the decrease is due to reduced purchases of manufacturing equipment 
in addition  in  we did not make any contributions to odorstar 
in  odorstar s initial year of operations  we contributed  cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in financing activities in is mostly due to net borrowings on our line of credit of  in compared to net repayments of  in  and  used in to redeem warrants held by our chairman  president and chief executive officer

the company also received approximately  from the exercise of stock options in compared to approximately  in during the year ended december   we continued to focus on programs to effectively manage trade accounts receivable 
net trade accounts receivable aggregated approximately  at december  and  at december   an increase of 
this increase reflects the increase in net sales 
in addition  we believe the relatively lower percentage increase in accounts receivable as compared to the percentage increase in net sales is due to collection efforts designed to limit our financial exposure 
inventory was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  or in the higher levels of inventory reflect management s determination to increase inventory levels of petroleum based products in anticipation of rising oil prices  as well as an increase in private label inventory levels 
on july   the company  together with its subsidiary  kinpak inc kinpak  entered into a credit agreement with regions bank and  pursuant to an equipment finance addendum to the credit agreement  regions equipment finance corporation refco under which a the company s revolving line of credit with regions bank was renewed  and b refco provided a new term loan in the amount of  the proceeds of which were used to pay the kinpak s remaining lease obligations in connection with the series of industrial development revenue bonds issued by the city of montgomery  alabama the bonds 
the bonds were used to fund the expansion of kinpak s facilities and acquisition of related equipment 
under the new term loan  the company will pay the  principal  together with interest  at the fixed rate of per annum  in consecutive monthly payments of  over the six year period beginning on august   with the final payment on july  in the event the company s debt service coverage ratio falls below to  interest on the term loan will increase by per annum 
for the year ended december   the company s debt service coverage ratio exceeded to the credit agreement defines debt service coverage ratio as meaning net profit plus taxes  interest  depreciation  amortization and rent expense divided by debt service plus interest and lease rent expense 
the credit agreement contains various covenants  including financial covenants requiring a minimum debt coverage ratio of to  tested on a rolling four quarter basis  and a maximum debt to capitalization ratio funded debt divided by the sum of total net worth and funded debt of to  tested quarterly 

at december   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
under the renewed revolving line of credit  the company may borrow up to the lesser of i million and ii a borrowing base equal to of eligible accounts receivable plus of eligible inventory 
interest on the revolving line of credit is payable at the day libor rate plus per annum unless the company s debt service coverage ratio falls below to  in which case the additional percentage will be per annum 
in no event will the interest rate be less than per annum 
outstanding amounts under the revolving line of credit are payable on demand 
if no demand is made  the company may repay and reborrow funds from time to time 
interest payments are made in monthly installments on outstanding average balances with all outstanding principal and interest payable on july  the company s obligations under the credit agreement are secured by the company s accounts receivable and inventory  as well as real property and equipment at the kinpak s montgomery  alabama facility 
in addition to the revolving line of credit and term loan  the company has obtained financing through capital leases for both manufacturing and office equipment  totaling approximately  and  at december  and december   respectively 
we make sales in the canadian market and are subject to currency fluctuations relating to the canadian dollar 
we do not engage in currency hedging and address currency risk as a pricing issue 
in the year ended december   we recorded approximately  in foreign currency translation adjustments increasing shareholders equity by 
during the past few years  we have introduced a number of new products 
at times  new product introductions have required us to increase our overall inventory and have resulted in lower inventory turnover rates 
the effects of reduced inventory turnover have not been material to our overall operations 
we believe that all required capital to maintain such increases will continue to be provided by operations and our current financing arrangements 
many of the raw materials that we use in the manufacturing process are petroleum or chemical based and commodity chemicals that are subject to fluctuating prices 
the nature of our business does not enable us to pass through the price increases to our national retailers and distributors  as promptly as we experience increases in raw material costs 
this may  at times  adversely affect our margins 
at december  and through the date of this report  we did not and do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures  nor do we have any other present commitment that is likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
we believe that funds provided through operations and our existing sources of financing will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over at least the next twelve months
