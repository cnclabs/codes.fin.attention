we generally experience a greater concentration of renewals in the second and fourth fiscal quarters 
however  since our revenues are recognized ratably over the related service period and contracts are generally invoiced in advance either annually or on a quarterly basis over the contract period  the impact on our revenue is not material

we were in compliance with all of our financial and non financial covenants as of december  these agreements also contain customary events of default  including  but not limited to  cross defaults among 
table of contents these agreements 
although we currently expect to remain in compliance with these existing covenants  any breach of these covenants or a change in control could result in a default  and subsequent cross defaults  under the credit agreements  which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness to become immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
liquidity and capital resources we currently use the net cash generated from operations to fund our working capital needs as well as our capital expenditure and debt service requirements 
our available financing arrangements include a million revolving line of credit  of which million is available to us as of december  at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  and million in accounts receivable  net of allowances for doubtful accounts and credit reserves

this overall reduction of our outstanding indebtedness has significantly reduced the total interest expense we expect to pay in future periods 
the credit markets have experienced disruption that reached unprecedented levels during late and and more recently in the disruption in the financial markets has affected some of the financial institutions with which we do business 
a continued  sustained decline in the stability of these financial institutions could adversely affect our access to financing  as well as our revenue growth due to our customer base in the m a dcm principal markets 
additionally  if the national or global economy or credit market conditions in general were to deteriorate further  it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our credit ratings  among other things  including our ability to obtain external financing or to refinance our existing indebtedness 
there has been no change in our credit rating  since standard poor s lifted our corporate credit rating from b to bb with a stable outlook on june  additionally  there has been no change in our issue level rating on our first lien credit facility since the rating was raised to bb from bb on june   in conjunction with the corporate credit rating change

rating agency rating outlook moody s b stable standard poor s bb stable credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically  and therefore the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time 
factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance  economic environment  our financial position  conditions in any of our principal markets  and changes in our business strategy 
if weak financial market conditions or competitive dynamics cause any of these factors to deteriorate we could see a reduction in our corporate credit rating 

table of contents changes in our credit rating could adversely impact the interest rates on our first lien credit facility

total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including current portion   interest on long term debt    operating leases     third party hosting commitments    other contractual commitments including interest total      long term debt and interest on long term debt cash obligations on long term debt  presented in the table above  represent scheduled principal payments due in each respective period 
interest on long term debt consists of expected interest payments on the first lien credit facility through its maturity date  based on the assumptions regarding the amount of debt outstanding and assumed interest rates 
the assumed interest rate on the first lien credit facility was  representing a libor floor plus spread 
in addition  this amount reflects the impact of the interest rate swap on the variable rate debt  for which we expect to pay a fixed rate of through june in june  we entered into a financing arrangement in the amount of million for third party software  including financing costs of million to be repaid over a term of months 
in december  we entered into a second financing arrangement in the amount of million to be repaid over a term of months for licensing and support of internal systems 
operating leases and third party hosting commitments our principal executive office in new york  new york occupies approximately  square feet 
this space is comprised of  square feet that are subject to a lease agreement that expires in july and  square feet that are subject to a sublease agreement that expires in december in addition  our research and development facilities in charlestown  massachusetts occupy  square feet under a lease that expires in december we also occupy space in london  chicago  s o paolo  hong kong  frankfurt  sydney  melbourne  paris and san francisco for our sales and services activities 
we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs 
however  we may obtain additional office space to house additional services personnel in the near future  and we may require other additional office space as our business grows 
the future minimum lease payments of the new lease are included in the above table 
our commitments to our third party hosting provider expire in december our hosting obligations are largely impacted by service expansion requirements in line with the growth of our business 
uncertain tax positions tax reserves for uncertain tax positions  excluding interest and penalties  totaling million and million at december  and  respectively  are included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
the net increase of million in resulted from million related to current year tax positions  and million for prior year tax positions offset by a million release of 
table of contents reserves due to expirations of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions 
we do not expect the balance of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase or decrease over the next twelve months 
we are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make cash payments required to settle these liabilities beyond the next twelve months  but we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  and did not have during the periods presented  any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec rules  such as relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating financing transactions that are not required to be reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements we refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding the expected impact of the adoption of certain accounting pronouncements on future period consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
interest rate sensitivity term loans under the first lien credit agreement  as amended  bear interest at the higher of the eurodollar rate  or  plus per annum 
although the interest on our first lien credit facility is defined as variable  the existence of the eurodollar rate floor of has caused us  in recent years  to not be subject to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates because the eurodollar rate has been considerably lower than 
if the eurodollar rate were to rise above  our results of operations  specifically interest expense on the first lien credit facility  would be subject to market risk 
the fair value of the interest rate swap is measured each reporting period and includes a credit valuation adjustment that reflects consideration of our credit risk  since the interest rate swap is in a liability position 
the fair value measurement of the swap may fluctuate considerably from period to period due to volatility in underlying interest rates  which is driven by market conditions and the duration of the swap 
in both of the years ended december  and  a increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease of million  to other income expense  net  within our consolidated statement of operations 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including money market funds  certificates of deposit  us treasuries  commercial paper and corporate debt securities 
a decrease in interest rates in the year ended december   or the year ended december   would not have had a material impact on a total dollar basis on our interest income during those periods  respectively  due to the immateriality of the interest income generated by our investments during those periods 
foreign currency exchange risk during the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were generated from sales across countries outside of the united states 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly between the us dollar  pound sterling and euro 
during the year ended december   the currency markets experienced significant fluctuations which caused us to incur foreign currency transaction losses of million  in those respective periods 
during the year ended december  we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of million 
the debt crisis in europe has resulted in uncertainty with the stability of the euro 
efforts to prevent the collapse of euro member economies have proven effective and continued progress is prevalent in early with a significant portion of our revenue being generated in europe  our european operations are subject to risk if the euro were to be devalued 
for example  the effect of a devaluation in the euro on our revenue generating activities in europe would have resulted in an additional million recorded as a loss to our other income expense  net  within our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  comparatively  an appreciation in the euro of on our revenue generating activities in europe would have resulted in an additional million recorded as a gain to our other income expense  net within our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in addition  a significant portion of our revenue generating activities are in the united kingdom 
for example  the effect of a devaluation in the pound sterling on our revenue generating activities in the united kingdom would have resulted in an additional million recorded as a gain to our other income expense  net  within our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  comparatively  an appreciation in the pound sterling of on our revenue generating activities in the united kingdom would have resulted in an additional million recorded as a loss to our other income expense  net within our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  
table of contents inflation risk our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash  cash equivalents and investments  are not affected significantly by inflation because they are short term 
we believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
the rate of inflation  however  affects our cost of revenue and expenses  such as those for employee compensation  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of the services offered by us
