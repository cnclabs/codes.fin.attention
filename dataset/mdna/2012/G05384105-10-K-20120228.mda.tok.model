table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of the results of our operations for the twelve months ended december   and and of our financial condition at december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and that are not historical facts  including statements about our beliefs and expectations 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and particularly under the headings risk factors  business and forward looking statements contained in item a  item  and part i of this report  respectively 
aspen s year in review a significant combination of catastrophe events and depressed investment returns made one of the tougher years the insurance industry has faced for some time  and one of the worst years of catastrophe related losses in history 
countries around the globe faced a series of natural disasters  including an earthquake and tsunami in japan  earthquakes in new zealand  cyclone and flooding in australia  a hurricane and a series of severe tornadoes in the united states  and devastating floods in thailand 
industry wide losses in totalled about billion 
this is more than double the figure of billion in  and second only to the record of billion in when us hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma alone cost the insurance industry over billion 
for  we reported a net loss of per share 
diluted book value was per share  a decrease of from year end though these conditions impacted our financial results for the year  we continued to execute our strategy and adjusted our tactics as required to protect our balance sheet  preserve shareholder value and position our business for future growth 
insurance 
the insurance segment had a successful year and achieved an underwriting profit of million for and a combined ratio of  compared with for this reflected not only significant growth in certain niche areas  but also an improvement across a number of lines 
we continued our build out of our us insurance platform 
we hired mario vitale in march of to lead our us insurance operations 
we hired a new surety underwriting team in may of and by december we had all the required regulatory consents in place and were fully operational 
we continued our approval process for admitted licenses and we now have received admitted licenses in us states and the district of columbia 
we also expanded our programs book with a major new contract for a successful new york based mga which was bound in september and which we expect to develop annual gross written premiums of around million when fully seasoned over time 
in environmental and primary casualty  we upgraded talent and strengthened our underwriting capabilities 
we also continued to build out management expertise and infrastructure to support growth and development 
reinsurance 
our casualty and specialty reinsurance lines of business had good performances  although the reinsurance segment was materially impacted by a high frequency and severity of natural catastrophes in the reinsurance segment had a combined ratio of which included million  or percentage points  of pre tax catastrophe losses  net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums 
the reinsurance segment s underwriting loss was million compared with an underwriting profit of million in investment management 
during  we diversified our investment strategy and invested million into a global equity income portfolio 
we also increased our interest rate swaps program from a total notional amount of million to billion  due to mature between august  and november  entering into these additional interest rate swaps will partially mitigate the expected negative impact of rises in interest rates on the market value of our fixed income portfolio 

table of contents financial overview the following overview of our  and operating results and financial condition is intended to identify important themes and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion further below 
net income 
for  we reported a loss after taxes of million  compared to income after taxes of million in and income after taxes of million in the significant decrease in net income from was due to total net losses after tax of million from natural disasters in which included million from the japanese earthquake and tsunami  million from the us storms  million from the thai floods  million from the new zealand earthquake  million from the australian floods and million from other natural catastrophes 
the decrease in net income in over was due to a combination of reduced underwriting performance mainly arising from million of pre tax catastrophe losses  following earthquakes in chile and new zealand in and a million pre tax reduction in prior year reserve releases 
gross written premiums 
total gross written premiums increased by in compared to and by compared to the changes in our segment gross written premiums for the twelve months ended december  and are as follows  with reductions shown as negative percentages 
gross written premiums for the twelve months ended december  business segment in millions increase in millions increase in millions decrease decrease reinsurance insurance total the increase in gross written premiums in was principally attributable to the insurance segment 
gross written premiums in our reinsurance segment have increased due to growth in our property catastrophe and specialty reinsurance business lines  which recognized loss related additional premiums  offset by decreased premiums written in property risk excess and international casualty reinsurance within our other property reinsurance and casualty reinsurance lines  respectively 
gross written premiums in our insurance segment have increased by from  mainly due to the property and the financial and professional lines 
increases in gross written premium in property included our program business  as well as increases in us property which benefited from rate increases in the year 
our financial and professional lines have benefited from increased demand for our kidnap and ransom products 
gross written premiums in our casualty insurance lines have reduced when compared to as we declined business that did not meet our profitability requirements coupled with higher client retention in some classes 
gross written premiums for in both our insurance and reinsurance segments were broadly in line with within our reinsurance segment  our property catastrophe reinsurance line of business benefited from favorable market conditions and million of reinstatement premiums from the chilean earthquake while our other property reinsurance lines had a million reduction in premium as a result of higher cedant retentions 
the increase in our insurance segment s gross written premiums was due to growth in property lines where we saw opportunities to write business that met our expected profitability requirements 
market conditions remained challenging in casualty insurance  resulting in a million reduction in written premium in these lines 
reinsurance 
total reinsurance ceded in increased by million from the reinsurance segment has recognized the costs of catastrophe programs purchased to provide additional cover for the third quarter s wind season after the first two quarters catastrophe events 
reinsurance costs also increased for the insurance segment in as we purchased advanced protection for our new us professional lines business as well as an increase in the us property program 

table of contents total reinsurance ceded in was million lower than in the overall decrease was due mainly to the insurance segment following the cancellation of a reinsurance quota share for us property insurance  and lower costs of quota share outwards reinsurance resulting from reduced gross written premium 
loss ratio 
we monitor the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premium the loss ratio as a measure of relative underwriting performance where a lower ratio represents a better result than a higher ratio 
the loss ratios for our two business segments for the twelve months ended december   and were as follows loss ratios for the twelve months ended december  business segment reinsurance insurance total the loss ratio for was compared to in the increase in the loss ratio was attributable to a number of catastrophe losses in the period 
net losses before reinstatement premiums and taxes included million from the australian floods  million from the new zealand earthquake and million from the japanese earthquake and tsunami  all of which occurred in the first quarter of  million from the us storms in the second quarter  million from hurricane irene  million from the thai floods in the fourth quarter  and million from other natural catastrophes us  scandinavian and asian weather related events 
the loss ratio in the reinsurance segment in was higher than in due to experiencing a higher frequency of catastrophe losses than total catastrophe losses in added percentage points to the loss ratio in the reinsurance segment while catastrophe losses in increased the loss ratio by percentage points 
the loss ratio in the insurance segment was lower in mainly due to million of favorable reserve development on prior years compared to million of reserve strengthening in the increase in the reinsurance loss ratio in was due mainly to million of losses associated with the earthquakes in chile and new zealand 
the loss ratio in the reinsurance segment for was lower due to the absence of major catastrophes when compared to the increase in the insurance loss ratio in was mainly due to additional prior year reserve strengthening of million compared to million of strengthening in prior year reserve movements 
the loss ratios take into account any changes in our assessments of reserves for unpaid claims and loss adjustment expenses arising from earlier years 
in each of the years ended december   and  we recorded a reduction in the level of reserves for prior years 
the amounts of these reductions and their effects on the loss ratio in each year are shown in the following table for the twelve months ended december  in millions  except for percentages reserve releases of net premiums earned reserve releases increased by million in due to a net reserve release of million for our insurance segment compared to a million reserve strengthening in reserve releases were million lower in due to less favorable developments impacting our insurance segment  particularly our casualty insurance and financial and professional lines 
in  reserve releases from our property reinsurance and casualty reinsurance lines combined with releases from our non us insurance lines offset reserve strengthening in our us reinsurance lines 

table of contents further information relating to the release of reserves can be found below under reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses prior year loss reserves 
expense ratio 
we monitor the ratio of expenses to net earned premium the expense ratio as a measure of the cost effectiveness of our business acquisition  operating and administrative processes 
the table below presents the contribution of the policy acquisition expenses and operating  administrative and corporate expenses to the expense ratio and the total expense ratios for the twelve months ended december   and expense ratios for the twelve months ended  december  policy acquisition expenses general  administrative and corporate expenses expense ratio the policy acquisition expense ratio has increased to in the increase is due mainly to the increase in reinsurance costs which have added percentage points to the acquisition expense ratio  and to a change in the mix of business written across both segments where we have written a greater proportion of business with higher average commission rates 
the policy acquisition expense ratio reduced to in mainly as a result of a reduction in profit related commissions in our reinsurance segment 
in  the policy acquisition expense ratio increased to from in due to the impact of profit related commission 
the general  administrative and corporate expense ratio has increased from to in as a result of expenses increasing from million in to million in the increase in general  administrative and corporate expenses is due to our continued build out of our us insurance infrastructure and operations  the us regional platform and the swiss insurance operations 
the ratio has also been adversely affected by the increased reinsurance costs 
the general  administrative and corporate expense ratio of for is broadly in line with with the increased expenditure associated with our expansion into the us admitted market and us regional distribution network balanced by reductions in profit related compensation in net investment income 
in  we generated net investment income of million  a decrease of on the prior year million  million 
in  lower reinvestment rates and declining book yields from fixed income securities were partially offset by million of dividend income from global equity securities 
in  the lower interest rate environment and hence lower reinvestment rates resulted in lower net investment income for the year compared to in addition  investment income in benefited from a million contribution from our investments in funds of hedge funds which we exited on june  change in fair value of derivatives 
in the twelve months ended december   we recorded a reduction in the fair value of derivatives of million million  million 
this includes a loss of million in the value of our interest rate swaps which we entered into during and in the twelve months ended december   we recorded a reduction of million million in the estimated fair value of our credit insurance contract 
on october   we gave notice of our intention to cancel our credit insurance contract with effect from november  the notice of cancellation triggered a final payment of million to the contract counter parties 
at december   we held eight foreign currency derivative contracts to purchase million of us and foreign currencies 
the foreign currency contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value with changes recorded as a change in fair value of derivatives in the statement of operations 
at december  and december   there were no outstanding foreign currency contracts 
for the twelve months ended december   foreign currency contracts increased net income by million 

table of contents other revenues and expenses 
other revenues and expenses in included million of foreign currency exchange losses million gains  million gains and million of realized and unrealized investment gains million  million 
realized and unrealized gains included million million  million of net realized gains from the fixed income maturities available for sale portfolio  million million  million of net realized gains from our fixed income maturities trading portfolio  million net unrealized losses million gain  million gain from our fixed income maturities trading portfolio  million of net realized losses from our equity investments nil  nil and million million  million representing our share of earnings from our investment in cartesian iris 
we have also recognized million income of million  income million of other expenses for the year ending december  which is primarily due to losses associated with funds withheld contracts 
in  we had no other than temporary impairment charges on our investments million  million 
interest payable was million in million  million 
taxes 
we recognized a tax credit in of million million expense  equivalent to a consolidated rate on income before tax of in compared to in and in the tax credit in is due to the geographic distribution of catastrophe losses  adjustments to prior years positions and changes in uk corporation tax rates 
dividends 
the quarterly dividend has been maintained at per ordinary share for  and dividends paid on the preference shares in were million 
dividends paid on the preference shares in were million  million lower than the prior year  as a result of repurchasing million of our liquidation value preference shares nyse ahl pa at a price of per share 
shareholders equity and financial leverage 
total shareholders equity decreased from  million at the end of december  to  million as at december  the most significant movements were net loss after tax for the year of million  an increase in net of tax unrealized gains on investments of million  accounted for in other comprehensive income  share repurchases of million during the year  and dividend payments to ordinary and preference shareholders totaling million in as at december   the remainder of our total shareholders equity was funded by two classes of preference shares with a total value as measured by their respective liquidation preferences of million million less issue costs of million million 
our senior notes were the only material debt that we had issued as of december  and million  million 
management monitors the ratio of debt to total capital  with total capital being defined as shareholders equity plus outstanding debt 
at december   this ratio was our preference shares are classified in our balance sheet as equity but may receive a different treatment in some cases under the capital adequacy assessments made by certain rating agencies 
we also monitor the ratio of the total of debt and hybrids to total capital which was as of december   
the increase in the ratio reflects our issuance of million senior notes in december we set targets for financial leverage which we believe provide an appropriate balance between improving returns to our ordinary shareholders while maintaining the levels of financial strength expected by our customers and by the rating agencies 
for this purpose  we define financial leverage as the ratio of long term debt and hybrid capital to total 
table of contents capital 
the term hybrid refers to securities  such as our preference shares  which have characteristics of both debt and equity 
diluted tangible book value per ordinary share at december  was  a decrease of compared to at december  book value per ordinary share is based on total shareholders equity  less preference shares liquidation preference less issue expenses  divided by the number of ordinary shares in issue at the end of the period 
balances as at december  and december  were as at as at december  december  in millions  except for share amounts total shareholders equity preference shares less issue expenses ordinary shares diluted ordinary shares liquidity 
management monitors the liquidity of aspen holdings and of each of its operating subsidiaries 
with respect to aspen holdings  management monitors its ability to service debt  to finance dividend payments and to provide financial support to the operating subsidiaries 
during the year ended december   aspen holdings received a million payment of inter company interest in respect of an inter company loan from aspen uk holdings 
in addition  aspen holdings received dividends of million million from aspen uk holdings and million million from aspen bermuda 
as at december   aspen holdings held million in cash and cash equivalents which  taken together with our credit facilities and expected levels of future inter company dividends  we believe to be sufficient to provide us with an appropriate level of liquidity 
at december   the operating subsidiaries held  million in cash and cash equivalents that are readily realizable securities 
management monitors the value  currency and duration of the cash and investments within its operating subsidiaries to ensure that  individually  they are able to meet their insurance and other liabilities as they become due and that a margin of liquidity was held as at december  and for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had in issue million and million in letters of credit to cedants  against which we held  million and million of collateral 
our reinsurance receivables increased by from million at december  to million at december   mainly as a result of the recognition of recoveries associated with the new zealand earthquake and thailand floods 
current market conditions  rate trends and developments in early across our entire book of business  january renewal rates increased on average by overall 
however  we cannot ascertain that a hard market has arrived 
behind this overall increase  there are some attractive areas 
in property  in both insurance and reinsurance  a combination of model change in the us and much needed lessons from the catastrophe losses in the rest of the world is creating an underwriters market 
for most us and asian catastrophe exposures  we can expect to be paid properly for the risks we want to take 
for different reasons  a similar phenomenon exists in many lines of business that are affected by credit risk  financial risk  political risk and other forms of uncertainty 
our underwriters in lines such as surety  trade credit  political risk and financial institutions are well placed to drive rates upwards which we believe should achieve attractive results 
if the rates do not meet our targets  we anticipate waiting for the right moment to grow 
taken together  these lines that are affected 
table of contents by natural hazards or by political or financial risk account for approximately of the book of business that we expect to write in in other areas  we are achieving single digit percentage rate increases or we are maintaining rates 
reinsurance 
us property catastrophe rates rose to on january renewals while rates for european property catastrophe covers renewed at flat rates to increases of up to 
looking forward to the japan april renewals  we anticipate these rates should rise significantly following the japanese earthquake and tsunami and japanese cedant related loss activity in thailand in there is speculation in the scientific community concerning whether the risk of earthquake in the tokyo bay area has increased following the japanese earthquake 
we are persuaded that the resulting uncertainty demands a higher price and we expect to be demanding rate increases of up to for japanese earthquake business 
casualty rates remain flat and premium rates in specialty reinsurance are stable although we have achieved price increases of at least in the loss affected marine and offshore energy market 
insurance 
january is not a major renewal date for insurance overall 
in the insurance markets  international terms and conditions remain stable and the insurance market place is reluctant to provide multi year policies at this point 
we regard this as significant because this is the stage in the cycle where many buyers would like to have multi year policies locked in at relatively weak rates 
we are encouraged that the underwriting market is not agreeing to this 
looking forward to the mid year us property renewals  we estimate that we could see double digit price increases as adoption of rms version becomes increasingly incorporated into pricing models 
for casualty renewals  the market conditions remain challenging in uk liability  however we experienced significant price increases of approximately on our global excess casualty account 
in aviation  a small proportion of our account renews in january and while the overall market and airline sector remain over served by competition  we expect that our unique approach will continue to yield good profits 
recent developments in early costa concordia cruise liner 
the costa concordia cruise liner incident which took place off the coast of western italy on january  is a complex loss and there are various factors and uncertainties which will have an impact on the quantum of loss 
aspen has exposure in both its insurance and reinsurance segments  mainly arising from its marine hull and marine liability insurance accounts 
we expect that our loss from the insurance business will be contained within our outwards reinsurance program and that our retained loss will be less than million before reinstatement premiums 
in the reinsurance segment  our exposure arises from the specialty reinsurance account  and losses are expected to be less than of the market loss 
we are at an early stage in assessing the loss from costa concordia and these figures represent our current view 
group chief financial officer 
on february   we announced that mr 
richard houghton will be stepping down from his role as group chief financial officer and director with effect from february  critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective in nature and require management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine the reported values 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
a statement of all the significant accounting policies we use to prepare our financial statements is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
if factors such as those described in item a  risk factors cause actual events to differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting policy and calculating financial results  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents written premiums 
written premiums are comprised of the estimated premiums on contracts of insurance and reinsurance entered into in the reporting period  except in the case of proportional reinsurance contracts  where written premium relates only to our estimated proportional share of premiums due on contracts entered into by the ceding company prior to the end of the reporting period 
all premium estimates are reviewed regularly  comparing actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums along with a review of the collectability of premiums receivable 
based on management s review  the appropriateness of the premium estimates is evaluated  and any adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the periods in which they become known 
adjustments to original premium estimates could be material and these adjustments may directly and significantly impact earnings in the period they are determined because the subject premium may be fully or substantially earned 
we refer to premiums receivable which are not fixed at the inception of the contract as adjustment premiums 
the proportion of adjustable premiums included in the premium estimates varies between business lines with the largest adjustment premiums associated with property and casualty reinsurance business and the smallest with property and liability insurance lines 
adjustment premiums are most significant in relation to reinsurance contracts 
differing considerations apply to non proportional and proportional treaties as follows non proportional treaties 
a large number of the reinsurance contracts we write are written on a non proportional or excess of loss treaty basis 
as the ultimate level of business written by each cedant can only be estimated at the time the reinsurance is placed  the reinsurance contracts generally stipulate a minimum and deposit premium payable under the contract with an adjustable premium determined by variables such as the number of contracts covered by the reinsurance  the total premium received by the cedant and the nature of the exposures assumed 
minimum and deposit premiums generally cover the majority of premiums due under such treaty reinsurance contracts and the adjustable portion of the premium is usually a small portion of the total premium receivable 
for excess of loss contracts  the minimum and deposit premium  as defined in the contract  is generally considered to be the best estimate of the contract s written premium at inception 
accordingly  this is the amount we generally record as written premium in the period the underlying risks incept 
during the life of a contract  notifications from cedants and brokers may affect the estimate of ultimate premium and result in either increases or reductions in reported revenue 
changes in estimated adjustable premiums do not generally have a significant impact on short term liquidity as the payment of adjustment premiums generally occurs after the expiration of a contract 
many non proportional treaties also include a provision for the payment to us by the cedant of reinstatement premiums based on loss experience under such contracts 
reinstatement premiums are the premiums charged for the restoration of the reinsurance limit of an excess of loss contract to its full amount after payment by the reinsurer of losses as a result of an occurrence 
these premiums relate to the future coverage obtained during the remainder of the initial policy term and are included in revenue in the same period as the corresponding losses 
proportional treaties treaty pro rata 
estimates of premiums assumed under treaty pro rata reinsurance contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks are expected to incept and are based on information provided by brokers and ceding companies and estimates of the underlying economic conditions at the time the risk is underwritten 
we estimate premium receivable initially and update our estimates regularly throughout the contract term based on treaty statements received from the ceding company 
the reported gross written premiums for treaty pro rata business include estimates of premiums due to us but not yet reported by the cedant because of time delays between contracts being written by our cedants and their submission of treaty statements to us 
this additional premium is normally described as pipeline premium 
treaty statements disclose information on the underlying contracts of insurance written by our cedants and are generally submitted on a monthly or quarterly basis  from to days in arrears 
in order to report all risks incepting prior to a period end  we estimate the premiums written between the last submitted treaty statement and the period end 

table of contents property treaty pro rata made a significant contribution to our reinsurance segment where we wrote million in gross written premium in million  or of our reinsurance segment  of which million was estimated million and million was reported by the cedants million 
we estimate that the impact of a million change in our estimated gross premiums written in our property treaty pro rata business would have an impact of million on our net income before tax for our property reinsurance segment at december  million  excluding the impact of fixed costs such as reinsurance premiums and operating expenses 
the most likely drivers of change in the estimates in decreasing order of magnitude are changes in the renewal rate or rate of new business acceptances by the cedant insurance companies leading to lower or greater volumes of ceded premiums than our estimate  which could result from changes in the relevant primary market that could affect more than one of our cedants or could be a consequence of changes in marketing strategy or risk appetite by a particular cedant  changes in the rates being charged by cedants  and differences between the pattern of inception dates assumed in our estimate and the actual pattern of inception dates 
we anticipate that ultimate premiums might reasonably be expected to vary by up to as a result of variations in one or more of the assumptions described above  although larger variations are possible 
based on gross written premiums of million million in our property reinsurance treaty pro rata account as of december   a variation of could increase or reduce net income before taxation by approximately million million 
earned premiums 
premiums are recognized as earned over the policy periods 
the premium related to the unexpired portion of each policy at the end of the reporting period is included in the balance sheet as unearned premiums 
premiums receivable 
premiums receivable are recorded as amounts due less any required provision for doubtful accounts 
a significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable  which represent estimated premiums written  net of commissions  is not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts 
in determining whether or not any bad debt provision is necessary  we consider the financial security of the policyholder  past payment history and any collateral held 
we have not made a provision for doubtful accounts in relation to assumed premium estimates 
in addition  based on the above process  management believes that the premium estimates included in premiums receivable will be collectable and  therefore  we have not maintained a bad debt provision for doubtful accounts on the premiums at december  credit insurance contract 
on november   the company entered into a credit insurance contract which  subject to its terms  insured us against losses due to the inability of one or more of our reinsurance counterparties to meet their financial obligations to us 
we considered this contract to be a financial guarantee insurance contract that did not qualify for exemption from treatment for accounting purposes as a derivative 
this is because it provided for the final settlement  expected to take place two years after expiry of cover  to include an amount attributable to outstanding and ibnr claims which may not at that point of time be due and payable to us 
as a result of the application of derivative accounting rules under asc  the contract was treated as an asset and measured at the directors estimate of its fair value 
changes in the estimated fair value from time to time were included in the consolidated statement of operations 
on october   we gave notice of our intention to cancel our credit insurance contract with effect from november  the notice of cancellation triggered a final payment of million to the contract counter parties 
foreign exchange contracts 
the company uses forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risk 
a forward foreign currency exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract 
foreign currency exchange 
table of contents contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of the company s assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  but rather allows it to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time 
the increase in the number of contracts purchased in compared to is due to hedging against foreign currency losses from the earthquakes in new zealand and japan 
the foreign currency contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value with changes recorded as a change in fair value of derivative in the company s statement of operations 
at december   we held eight foreign currency derivative contracts to purchase million of foreign currencies 
at december  and december   there were no outstanding foreign currency contracts 
for the twelve months ended december   the impact of foreign currency contracts on net income was million nil 
interest rate swaps 
as at december   we held a number of standard fixed for floating interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of billion billion due to mature between august  and november  the swaps are used in the ordinary course of the company s investment activities to partially mitigate the negative impact of rises in interest rates on the market value of our fixed income portfolio 
as at december   there was a charge in respect of the interest rate swaps of million million gain 
as at december   cash collateral with a fair value of million was transferred to our counterparties to support the current valuation of the of the interest rate swaps 
as at december   no non cash collateral million was transferred to us by our counterparty 
in accordance with fasb asc topic transfers and servicing  transfers of cash collateral are recorded on the balance sheet within derivatives at fair value  while transfers in respect of non cash collateral are disclosed but not recorded 
no amount was recorded in our balance sheet as at december  nil for the pledged assets 
reserving approach 
we are required by us gaap to establish loss reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses ultimate losses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers 
our loss reserves comprise the following components case reserves to cover the cost of claims that were reported to us but not yet paid  reserves for ibnr claims to cover the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not reported  and a reserve for the lae associated with settling claims  including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process 
prior to the selection by management of the reserves to be included in our financial statements  our actuarial team employs a number of techniques to establish a range of estimates from which they consider it reasonable for management to select a best estimate the actuarial range 
case reserves 
for reported claims  reserves are established on a case by case basis within the parameters of coverage provided in the insurance policy or reinsurance agreement 
in estimating the cost of these claims  we consider circumstances related to the claims as reported  any information available from cedants  lawyers and loss adjustors and information on the cost of settling claims with similar characteristics in previous periods 
in addition  for significant events such as the earthquake and tsunami in japan  for example  the detailed analysis of our potential exposures includes information obtained directly from cedants which has yet to be processed through market systems enabling us to reduce the time lag between a significant event occurring and establishing case reserves 
this additional information is also incorporated into the analysis used to determine the actuarial ibnr 
reinsurance intermediaries are used to assist in obtaining and validating information from cedants but we establish all reserves 
in addition  we may engage loss adjusters and perform on site cedant audits to validate the information provided 
disputes do occur with cedants  but the number and frequency are generally low 
in the event of a dispute  intermediaries are used to try to resolve the dispute 
if a resolution cannot be reached  then the contracts typically provide for binding arbitration 

table of contents ibnr claims 
the need for ibnr reserves arises from time lags between when a loss occurs and when it is actually reported and settled 
by definition  we do not have specific information on ibnr claims so they need to be estimated by actuarial methodologies 
ibnr reserves are therefore generally calculated at an aggregate level and cannot generally be identified as reserves for a particular loss or contract 
we calculate ibnr reserves by line of business and by accident year within that line 
where appropriate  analyses may be conducted on sub sets of a line of business 
ibnr reserves are calculated by projecting our ultimate losses on each line of business and subtracting paid losses and case reserves 
sources of information 
claims information received typically includes the loss date  details of the claim  the recommended reserve and reports from the loss adjusters dealing with the claim 
in respect of pro rata treaties we receive regular statements bordereaux which provide paid and outstanding claims information  often with large losses separately identified 
following widely reported loss events such as natural catastrophes and airplane crashes we adopt a proactive approach to establish our likely exposure to claims by reviewing policy listings and contacting brokers and policyholders as appropriate 
actuarial methodologies 
the main projection methodologies that are used by our actuaries are initial expected loss ratio ielr method this method calculates an estimate of ultimate losses by applying an estimated loss ratio to an estimate of ultimate earned premium for each accident year 
the estimated loss ratio may be based on pricing information and or industry data and or historical claims experience revalued to the year under review 
bornhuetter ferguson bf method the bf method uses as a starting point an assumed ielr and blends in the loss ratio  which is implied by the claims experience to date using benchmark loss development patterns on paid claims data paid bf or reported claims data reported bf 
although the method tends to provide less volatile indications at early stages of development and reflects changes in the external environment  it can be slow to react to emerging loss development and can  if the ielr proves to be inaccurate  produce loss estimates which take longer to converge with the final settlement value of loss 
loss development chain ladder method this method uses actual loss data and the historical development profiles on older accident years to project more recent  less developed years to their ultimate position 
exposure based method this method is typically used for specific large catastrophic events such as a major hurricane 
all exposure is identified and we work with known market information and information from our cedants to determine a percentage of the exposure to be taken as the ultimate loss 
in addition to these methodologies  our actuaries may use other approaches depending upon the characteristics of the line of business and available data 
in general terms  the ielr method is most appropriate for lines of business and or accident years where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet mature enough to modify our initial expectations of the ultimate loss ratios 
typical examples would be recent accident years for lines of business in the casualty reinsurance segment 
the bf method is generally appropriate where there are few reported claims and a relatively less stable pattern of reported losses 
typical examples would be our treaty risk excess line of business in our reinsurance segment and marine hull line of business in our insurance segment 
the chain ladder method is appropriate when there are relatively stable patterns of loss emergence and a relatively large number of reported claims 
typical examples are the uk commercial property and uk commercial liability lines of business in the international insurance segment 
reserving procedures and process 
our actuaries calculate the ielr  bf and chain ladder and  if appropriate  other methods for each line of business and each accident year 
they then provide a range of ultimates within which management s best estimate is most likely to fall 
this range will usually reflect a blend of the various methodologies 
these methodologies involve significant subjective judgments 
table of contents reflecting many factors such as changes in legislative conditions  changes in judicial interpretation of legal liability policy coverages and inflation 
our actuaries collaborate with underwriting  claims  legal and finance in identifying factors which are incorporated in their range of ultimates in which management s best estimate is most likely to fall 
the actuarial ranges are not intended to include the minimum or maximum amount that the claims may ultimately settle at  but are designed to provide management with ranges from which it is reasonable to select a single best estimate for inclusion in our financial statements 
there are no differences between our year end and our quarterly internal reserving procedures and processes because our actuaries perform the basic projections and analyses described above for each line of business 
selection of reported gross reserves 
management  through its reserve committee  then reviews the range of actuarial estimates  which to date it has not adjusted  and any other evidence before selecting its best estimate of reserves for each line of business and accident year 
management can select its best estimate outside the range provided by the actuaries  but to date gross reserves are within the range of actuarial estimates 
this provides the basis for the recommendation made by management to the audit committee and the board regarding the reserve amounts to be recorded in the company s financial statements 
the reserve committee is a management committee consisting of the head of risk chair of the reserve committee  the group chief actuary  the group chief financial officer and senior members of our underwriting and claims staff 
in the fourth quarter of  we established two separate reserve committees for our reinsurance and insurance segments 
there is a core membership of both committees consisting of the group head of risk  the group chief actuary  the group chief financial officer and the underwriting heads of insurance and reinsurance 
senior members of the insurance and reinsurance segment underwriting and claims staff comprise the remaining members of each committee 
each line of business is reviewed in detail by management  through its reserve committee  at least once a year  the timing of such reviews varies throughout the year 
additionally  for all lines of business  we review the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations every fiscal quarter 
if warranted from these loss emergence tests  we may accelerate the timing of our detailed actuarial reviews 
uncertainties 
while the management selected reserves make a reasonable provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense obligations  we note that the process of estimating required reserves does  by its very nature  involve uncertainty and therefore the ultimate claims may fall outside the actuarial range 
the level of uncertainty can be influenced by such factors as the existence of coverage with long duration reporting patterns and changes in claims handling practices  as well as the other factors described above 
because many of the coverages underwritten involve claims that may not be ultimately settled for many years after they are incurred  subjective judgments as to the ultimate exposure to losses are an integral and necessary component of the loss reserving process 
we review our reserves regularly  using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claims costs  frequency and severity data  and prevailing economic  social and legal factors 
reserves established in prior periods are adjusted as claims experience develops and new information becomes available 
estimates of ibnr are generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than estimates of the cost of settling claims already notified to us  where more information about the claim event is generally available 
ibnr claims often may not be apparent to the insured until many years after the event giving rise to the claims has happened 
lines of business where the ibnr proportion of the total reserve is high  such as liability insurance  will typically display greater variations between initial estimates and final outcomes because of the greater degree of difficulty of estimating these reserves 
lines of business where claims are typically reported relatively quickly after the claim event tend to display lower levels of volatility between initial estimates and final outcomes 
reinsurance claims are subject to a longer time lag both in their reporting and in their time to final settlement 
the time lag is a factor which is included in the projections to ultimate claims within the actuarial analyses and helps to 
table of contents explain why in general a higher proportion of the initial reinsurance reserves are represented by ibnr than for insurance reserves for business in the same class 
delays in receiving information from cedants are an expected part of normal business operations and are included within the statistical estimate of ibnr to the extent that current levels of backlog are consistent with historical data 
currently  there are no processing backlogs which would materially affect our financial statements 
allowance is made  however  for changes or uncertainties which may create distortions in the underlying statistics or which might cause the cost of unsettled claims to increase or reduce when compared with the cost of previously settled claims  including changes in our processes which might accelerate or slow down the development and or recording of paid or incurred claims  changes in the legal environment including challenges to tort reform  the effects of inflation  changes in the mix of business  the impact of large losses  and changes in our cedants reserving methodologies 
these factors are incorporated in the recommended reserve range from which management selects its best point estimate 
as at december   a change in the gross reserve for ibnr losses would have equated to a change of approximately million in loss reserves which would represent of loss before income tax for the twelve months ended december  as at december   a change in the gross reserve for ibnr losses would have equated to a change of approximately million in loss reserves which would represent of income before income tax for the twelve months ended december  there are specific areas of our selected reserves which have additional uncertainty associated with them 
in property reinsurance  there is still the potential for adverse development from litigation associated with hurricane katrina 
in casualty reinsurance  there are additional uncertainties associated with claims emanating from the global financial crisis 
there is also a potential for new areas of claims to emerge as underlying this segment are many long tail lines of business 
in the insurance segment  we wrote a book of financial institutions risks which have a number of notifications relating to the financial crisis in and and there is also a specific area of uncertainty relating to a book of new york contractor business 
in each case  management believes that they have selected an appropriate best estimate based on current information and current analyses 
loss reserving sensitivity analysis the most significant key assumptions identified in the reserving process are that the historic loss development and trend experience is assumed to be indicative of future loss development and trends  the information developed from internal and independent external sources can be used to develop meaningful estimates of the initial expected ultimate loss ratios  and no significant losses or types of losses will emerge that are not represented in either the initial expected loss ratios or the historical development patterns 
the selected best estimate of reserves is typically in excess of the mean of the actuarial reserve estimates 
the company believes that there is potentially significant risk in estimating loss reserves for long tail lines of business and for immature accident years that may not be adequately captured through traditional actuarial projection methodologies 
as discussed above  these methodologies usually rely heavily on projections of prior year trends into the future 
in selecting its best estimate of future liabilities  the company considers both the results of actuarial point estimates of loss reserves as well as the potential variability of these estimates as captured by a reasonable range of actuarial reserve estimates 
in determining the appropriate best estimate  the company reviews i the position of overall reserves within the actuarial reserve range  ii the result of bottom up analysis by accident year reflecting the impact of parameter uncertainty in actuarial calculations  and iii specific qualitative 
table of contents information on events that may have an effect on future claims but which may not have been adequately reflected in actuarial mid point estimates  such as the potential for outstanding litigation or claims practices of cedants to have an adverse impact 
in order to show the potential variability in the company s estimate of loss reserves  the internal actuaries use stochastic modeling techniques around their mean estimate 
we believe that stochastic modeling provides a distribution against which selected reserves can be assessed for which we show the probability of various outcomes relative to the actuarial mean estimate 
stochastic modeling provides a range of potential outcomes as reserve movements will be caused by any number of factors  and as such it is unlikely that only one factor will change in a given period  stochastic modeling techniques will reflect the impact from many factors 
the output from the stochastic modeling is more meaningful at a segmental level and is therefore not provided at a line of business level 
actuarial range of gross reserves 
the following tables show the th percentile  th percentile  actuarial mean estimate  th percentile and th percentile together with the actual percentile that the selected loss reserves represent 
the following table sets out the actuarial range of gross reserves for each of our segments and compares it to management s selected best estimate as at december  management s selected reserves include unallocated claims handling expenses which remain unchanged across all reserve distributions 
as at december  management s selected gross reserves reserve percentile th th mean th th in million  except for percentages reinsurance insurance diversification total gross losses and loss expense reserves as at december  management s selected gross reserves reserve percentile th th mean th th in million  except for percentages reinsurance insurance diversification total gross losses and loss expense reserves the above represents a distribution from our internal capital model for reserving risk based upon our current state of knowledge and application of actuarial principles 
the model itself has many explicit and implicit assumptions relating to the incurred pattern of claims  the expected ultimate settlement amount  inflation and dependencies between lines of business 
if any of these assumptions underlying the model were to prove incorrect  then a materially different reserving distribution may result 
the th percentile represents a in chance that  for example  reinsurance reserves will be at or lower than  million 
the th percentile represents a in chance that reserves will be at or greater than  million 
diversification reflects the fact that not all the segments are perfectly correlated  that is  we would not expect all lines of business to run off better than or worse than the mean at the same time 
if the ultimate liabilities equate to the mean actuarial estimate  then the impact from the change in loss reserves would be to increase net income before tax by million being the difference above 
table of contents between the selected loss reserves of  million and the mean value of  million  although the impact of such a change is unlikely to be recognized in one calendar year due to the unwinding of experience against expectations taking many years 
conversely  if the ultimate liabilities equate to the estimated th percentile  then the impact from the change in loss reserves would be to reduce net income before tax by million being the difference between the selected loss reserves of  million and the th percentile value of  million  although the impact of such a change is unlikely to be recognized in one calendar year 
changes in loss reserve estimates would not have an immediate effect on our liquidity as settlement of insurance liabilities typically can take a number of years 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity for a discussion of liquidity risks 
actuarial range of net reserves 
in determining the range of net reserves  we estimate recoveries due under our proportional and excess of loss reinsurance programs 
for proportional reinsurance we apply the appropriate cession percentages to estimate how much of the gross reserves will be collectable 
for excess of loss recoveries  individual large losses are modeled through our reinsurance program 
an assessment is also made of the collectability of reinsurance recoveries taking into account market data on the financial strength of each of the reinsurance companies 
the net actuarial range for reserves for losses and loss expenses assuming that net reserves move in proportion to gross would be between  million at the th percentile and  million at the th percentile 
the actual net reserves established as at december  were  million  million 
investments 
we currently classify all except million of our fixed income maturity investments and short term investments as available for sale and  accordingly  they are carried at estimated fair value 
the company uses quoted values and other data provided by internationally recognized independent pricing sources as inputs into its process for determining the fair value of its fixed income investments 
where multiple quotes or prices are obtained  a price source hierarchy is maintained in order to determine which price source provides the fair value ie  a price obtained from a pricing service with more seniority in the hierarchy will be used over a less senior one in all cases 
the hierarchy prioritizes pricing services based on availability and reliability and assigns the highest priority to index providers 
the fair value for mortgage backed and other asset backed debt securities  includes estimates regarding prepayment assumptions  which are based on current market conditions 
amortized cost in relation to these securities is calculated using a constant effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and estimated economic lives of the securities 
when actual prepayments differ significantly from anticipated prepayments  the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date 
changes in estimated yield are recorded on a retrospective basis  which result in future cash flows being used to determine current book value 
other than temporary impairment of investments 
a security is impaired when its fair value is below its amortized cost 
the company reviews its available for sale fixed income investment portfolio on an individual security basis for potential other than temporary impairment otti each quarter based on criteria including issuer specific circumstances  credit ratings actions and general macro economic conditions 
other than temporary impairment is deemed to occur when there is no objective evidence to support recovery in value of a security and a the company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its adjusted amortized cost basis or b it is deemed probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the individual security 
in the first case  the entire unrealized loss position is taken as an otti charge to realized losses in earnings 
in the second case  the unrealized loss is separated into the amount related to credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the otti charge related to credit loss is recognized in realized losses in earnings and the amount related to all other factors is recognized in other 
table of contents comprehensive income 
the cost basis of the investment is reduced accordingly and no adjustments to the cost basis are made for subsequent recoveries in value 
equity securities do not have a maturity date and therefore the company s review of these securities utilizes a higher degree of judgment 
in its review  the company considers its ability and intent to hold an impaired equity security for a reasonable period of time to allow for a full recovery 
where an equity security is considered to be other than temporarily impaired  the entire charge is recognized in realized losses in earnings 
the cost basis of the investment is reduced accordingly and no adjustments to the cost basis are made for subsequent recoveries in value 
although the company reviews each security on a case by case basis  it has also established parameters to help identify securities in an unrealized loss position which are other than temporarily impaired 
these parameters focus on the extent and duration of the impairment and for both fixed maturities and equities the company considers declines in value to a level or more below cost for consecutive months to indicate that the security may be other than temporarily impaired 
deferred tax assets 
we provide for income taxes for our subsidiaries operating in income tax paying jurisdictions 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from the net tax effect of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our audited consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction 
at each balance sheet date  management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction and available tax planning strategies 
estimates of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions that may differ from actual experience 
differences in our assumptions and resulting estimates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results of operations and liquidity 
any such differences are recorded in the period in which they become known

gross written premiums in our reinsurance segment increased by due to increases in property catastrophe and specialty reinsurance  which recognized loss related additional premiums  offset by decreased premiums written in property risk excess and international casualty within our other property reinsurance and casualty reinsurance lines  respectively 
gross written premiums in our insurance segment increased by to  million for from million in the increase in gross written premium is mainly attributable to the property lines and the financial and professional lines 
increases in gross written premium in property included our program business as well as increases in us property which benefited from rate increases in the year 
our financial and professional lines have benefited from increased demand for our kidnap and ransom products 
gross written premiums in our casualty insurance lines have reduced where we declined business that did not meet our profitability requirements coupled with higher client retention in some classes 
gross written premiums in were broadly in line with  with reductions in our reinsurance segment balanced by increases in our insurance segment 
gross written premiums in the reinsurance segment for contained an additional million from new teams that commenced underwriting in credit and surety and agriculture and million of additional catastrophe premium which includes million of reinstatement premiums from the chilean earthquake 
these increases were offset by reductions in other property reinsurance  casualty reinsurance and other specialty lines of business 
gross written premiums in the insurance segment of million for include additional 
table of contents contributions of million from property insurance where we saw opportunities to write business that met our profitability requirements compensating for reductions in casualty and energy physical damage 
net premiums written 
in  gross written premiums increased by while net premiums written increased by 
the lower level of growth in net premiums written was due to the million increase in reinsurance expenditure in the year due predominantly to the reinsurance segment recognizing the costs of catastrophe retrocession programs purchased to provide additional cover for the third quarter s wind season after the first two quarters catastrophe events 
in  while gross written premiums increased by only  net premiums written increased by compared to due to a reduction of million in ceded written premiums 
the overall decrease in the insurance segment reflected the cancellation of a reinsurance quota share for us property insurance and lower costs of quota share reinsurance resulting from reduced gross written premium 
in  although total gross written premiums increased by  net premiums written increased by only compared to as a result of the million increase in ceded written premiums 
gross premiums earned 
gross premiums earned reflect the portion of gross written premiums which are recorded as revenues over the policy periods of the risks we write 
the earned premium recorded in any year includes premium from policies incepting in prior years and excludes premium to be earned subsequent to the balance sheet date 
gross premiums earned in increased by compared to reflecting the increase in gross written premium earlier in the year  in particular in insurance and the million of reinstatement and loss related additional premiums associated with the catastrophe losses in the year 
gross premiums earned in increased by compared to reflecting the higher written premium earlier in the year and the million of reinstatement premiums from the chilean earthquake 
net premiums earned 
net premiums earned have decreased by million  or  in compared to due to the recognition of earned premiums associated with the additional reinsurance purchased to protect the second half of following the large losses in the first half of the year 
net premiums earned increased by million  or  in compared to which is consistent with the increase in gross earned premiums and the reduction in the cost of our reinsurance purchased in that period 
the changes in net premiums earned for each of our segments were as follows net premiums earned for the twelve months ended december  business segment in millions change in millions change in millions reinsurance insurance total losses and loss adjustment expenses 
losses and loss adjustment expenses have increased from  million in to  million in primarily due to million of net losses from natural disasters that occurred in principally the japanese earthquake and tsunami  us tornadoes  thai floods  australian floods and new zealand earthquakes

underwriting results by operating segments we are organized into two business segments reinsurance and insurance 
we have considered similarities in economic characteristics  products  customers  distribution  the regulatory environment of our operating segments and quantitative thresholds to determine our reportable segments 
the reinsurance segment consists of four principal lines of business property catastrophe reinsurance  other property reinsurance  casualty reinsurance and specialty reinsurance 
the insurance segment consists of property insurance  casualty insurance  marine  energy and transportation insurance and financial and professional lines insurance 
management measures segment results on the basis of the combined ratio  which is obtained by dividing the sum of the losses and loss expenses  acquisition expenses and operating and administrative expenses by net premiums earned 
other than corporate expenses  indirect operating and administrative expenses are allocated to segments based on each segment s proportional share of gross earned premiums 
as a relatively new company  our historical combined ratio may not be indicative of future underwriting performance 
non underwriting disclosures we have provided additional disclosures for corporate and other non underwriting income and expenses 
corporate and other includes net investment income  net realized and unrealized investment gains or losses  corporate expense  interest expense  net realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses and income taxes  which are not allocated to the underwriting segments 
corporate expenses are not allocated to our operating segments as they typically do not fluctuate with the levels of premium written and are related to our operations 
they include group executive costs  group finance  legal and actuarial costs  non underwriting share based compensation and certain strategic costs  including new teams which have not commenced underwriting

the increase was in contrast to reductions across our other reinsurance lines 
written premium in other property reduced as a result of higher cedant retentions  while challenging market conditions continued in casualty reinsurance 
specialty reinsurance premiums increased marginally with reductions in our structured risk portfolio being offset by premiums written in our then newly established credit and surety and non us agriculture accounts 
reinsurance ceded 
total reinsurance ceded of million increased by million from the reinsurance segment recognized the costs of catastrophe programs purchased to provide additional cover for the third quarter s wind season after the first two quarters catastrophe events 
total reinsurance ceded of million in decreased by million from  as we decided to selectively reduce some of our outwards reinsurance 
we purchased million of reinsurance contracts during which was attributable to a combination of specific reinsurance purchased to cover our then newly established lines of business and some higher renewal rates on existing reinsurance 
losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the loss ratio in was compared to in the increase in the loss ratio is attributable to a high frequency of catastrophe losses in with million from the japanese earthquake and tsunami  million from us storms including hurricane irene  million from the new zealand earthquake  million from the thai floods  million from the australian floods and million from other natural catastrophes us  scandinavian and asian weather related events 
all losses are net of reinsurance recoveries but before reinstatement premiums and tax 
the increase in losses has been partly mitigated by a million increase in prior year reserve releases compared to the net loss ratio for was compared to in the increase in the loss ratio was attributable to losses of million million net of reinstatement premiums relating to 
table of contents the earthquakes in chile and new zealand  which had an impact of and percentage points on the loss ratio and combined ratio  respectively  compared to an absence of significant catastrophe related losses in net reserve releases of million million were due mainly to favorable claims development in most lines but were significantly lower than  in particular for property catastrophe and specialty reinsurance 
policy acquisition  general and administrative expenses 
policy acquisition expenses were million for  equivalent to of net premiums earned million or of net premiums earned 
the increase in the ratio is due to our purchase of additional reinsurance reducing our net earned premium 
general and administrative expenses were million for  a million reduction from  attributable mainly to lower performance related accruals following the high loss activity of the policy acquisition expense ratio of of net premiums earned for was percentage points lower than in due largely to the mix of business with more property catastrophe business written which attracts lower average commission rates 
this line of business has lower brokerage costs and provides a greater contribution to the total amount of business written 
the general and administrative expense ratio of in increased from in due to an increase in general expenses as we continued to invest in the development of the business and growth of existing offices

the improvement in the loss ratio is attributable to a million prior year reserve release compared to a million reserve strengthening in in  we experienced limited catastrophe losses in this segment of million  while was impacted by million of net losses million including reinstatements from two oil pipeline spills and a gas explosion in california in addition to million of losses from the deepwater horizon oil spill 
the reserve releases for came primarily from our property  uk liability and aviation accounts partly offset by deterioration in financial and professional lines where we experienced higher than expected claims development from the professional liability lines

policy acquisition  general and administrative expenses 
policy acquisition expenses of million for were equivalent to of net premiums earned million or of net earned premium 
this was mainly due to an increase in premiums written as well as to a change in the mix of business written where we have written a lower proportion of casualty business which has lower average commission rates and a higher proportion of energy  us property and kidnap and ransom business which incur higher commission rates 
general and administrative expenses of million in have increased from million in mainly due to our continued build out of our us operations 
policy acquisition expenses for increased by million from with the cost increase reflecting the increase in gross written premiums 
general and administrative expenses of million for the twelve months ended december  decreased by million from due to including higher performance related compensation costs reflecting our performance in such year

our estimates of fair value for financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance included in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
the framework prioritizes the inputs  which refer broadly to assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability  into three levels  which are described in more detail below 
fixed maturities the company s fixed income maturity securities are classified as either available for sale or trading and carried at fair value 
at december  and december   the company s fixed income instruments were valued by pricing services  index providers or broker dealers  using standard market 
table of contents conventions 
the market conventions utilize market quotations  market transactions in comparable instruments and various relationships between instruments including  but not limited to  yield to maturity  dollar prices and spread prices in determining value 
the pricing sources are primarily internationally recognized independent pricing services and broker dealers 
independent pricing services and index providers 
the underlying methodology used to determine the fair value of securities in the company s available for sale and trading portfolios by the pricing services and index providers the company uses is very similar 
pricing services will gather observable pricing inputs from multiple external sources  including buy and sell side contacts and broker dealers  in order to develop their internal prices 
index providers are those firms which provide prices for a range of securities within one or more asset classes  typically using their own in house market makers traders as the primary pricing source for the indices  although ultimate valuations may also rely on other observable data inputs to derive a dollar price for all index eligible securities 
index providers without in house trading desks will function similarly to a pricing service in that they will gather their observable pricing inputs from multiple external sources 
all prices for the company s securities attributed to index providers are for an individual security within the respective indices 
pricing services and index providers  provide pricing for less complex  liquid securities based on market quotations in active markets 
pricing services and index providers supply prices for a broad range of securities including those for actively traded securities  such as treasury and other government securities  in addition to those that trade less frequently or where valuation includes reference to credit spreads  pay down and pre pay features and other observable inputs 
these securities include government agency  municipals  corporate and asset backed securities 
for securities that may trade less frequently or do not trade on a listed exchange  these pricing services and index providers may use matrix pricing consisting of observable market inputs to estimate the fair value of a security 
these observable market inputs include reported trades  benchmark yields  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers  reference data  and industry and economic factors 
additionally  pricing services and index providers may use a valuation model such as an option adjusted spread model commonly used for estimating fair values of mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
neither the company  nor its index providers  derives dollar prices using an index as a pricing input for any individual security 
broker dealers 
we obtain quotes from broker dealers who are active in the corresponding markets when prices are unavailable from independent pricing services or index providers 
generally  broker dealers value securities through their trading desks based on observable market inputs 
their pricing methodologies include mapping securities based on trade data  bids or offers  observed spreads and performance on newly issued securities 
they may also establish pricing through observing secondary trading of similar securities 
quotes from broker dealers are non binding 
the company obtains prices for all of its fixed income investment securities via its third party accounting service provider  in the majority of cases receiving a number of quotes so as to obtain the most comprehensive information available to determine a security s fair value 
a single valuation is applied to each security based on the vendor hierarchy maintained by our third party accounting service provider 
at december   we obtained an average of quotes per fixed income investment  compared to quotes at december  pricing sources used in pricing our fixed income investments at december  and december   respectively  were as follows twelve months ended twelve months ended december  december  index providers pricing services broker dealers total 
table of contents at december   we obtained an average of quotes per equity investment 
we had no equity investments as at december  pricing sources used in pricing our equities at december  were as follows twelve months ended twelve months ended december  december  index providers n a pricing services n a broker dealers n a total n a at december   pricing for approximately of our total fixed income maturities was based on prices provided by internationally recognized index providers

table of contents the company  in conjunction with its third party accounting service provider  obtains an understanding of the methods  models and inputs used by the third party pricing service and index provider to assess the on going appropriateness of vendors prices 
the company and its third party accounting service provider also have controls in place to validate that amounts provided represent fair values 
processes to validate and review pricing include  but are not limited to quantitative analysis eg  comparing the quarterly return for each managed portfolio to its target benchmark  with significant differences identified and investigated  comparison of market values obtained from pricing services  index providers and broker dealers against fund manager pricing where further investigation is completed when significant differences exist for pricing of individual securities between pricing sources  initial and ongoing evaluation of methodologies used by outside parties to calculate fair value  and comparison of the fair value estimates to our knowledge of the current market and on a sample basis against alternative internationally recognized independent pricing sources 
prices obtained from pricing services  index providers and broker dealers are not adjusted by us  however  prices provided by a pricing service  index provider or broker dealer in certain instances may be challenged based on market or information available from internal sources  including those available to our third party investment accounting service provider 
subsequent to any challenge  revisions made by the pricing service  index provider or broker dealer to the quotes are supplied to our investment accounting service provider 
management reviews the vendor hierarchy maintained by our third party accounting service provider in order to determine which price source provides the most appropriate fair value ie a price obtained from a pricing service with more seniority in the hierarchy will be used over a less senior one in all cases 
the hierarchy level assigned to each security in the company s available for sale and trading portfolios is based upon its assessment of the transparency and reliability of the inputs used in the valuation as of the measurement date 
the hierarchy of index providers and pricing services is determined using various qualitative and quantitative points arising from reviews of the vendors conducted by the company s third party accounting service provider 
vendor reviews include annual onsite due diligence meetings with index providers and pricing services vendors covering valuation methodology  operational walkthroughs and legal and compliance updates 
index providers are assigned the highest priority in the pricing hierarchy due primarily to availability and reliability of pricing information 
the company s fixed income securities are traded on the over the counter market based on prices provided by one or more market makers in each security 
securities such as us government  us agency  foreign government and investment grade corporate bonds have multiple market makers in addition to readily observable market value indicators such as expected credit spread  except for treasury securities  over the yield curve 
the company uses a variety of pricing sources to value our fixed income securities including those securities that have pay down prepay features such as mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities in order to ensure fair and accurate pricing 
the fair value estimates for the investment grade securities in the company s portfolio do not use significant unobservable inputs or modeling techniques 
the company considers prices for actively traded securities to be derived based on quoted prices in an active market for identical assets  which are level inputs in the fair value hierarchy 
as the fair values of our us treasury securities are based on unadjusted market prices in active markets  they are classified within level as identified in the tables above  the majority of securities are valued using prices supplied by index providers 
the company considers prices for other securities that may not be as actively traded which are priced via pricing services  index providers vendors and broker dealers  or with reference to interest rates and yield curves  to be derived based on inputs that are observable for the asset  either directly or 
table of contents indirectly  which are level inputs in the fair value hierarchy 
as identified in the table above  these securities are also valued using prices supplied by index providers the company considers securities  other financial instruments and derivative insurance contracts subject to fair value measurement whose valuation is derived by internal valuation models to be based largely on unobservable inputs  which are level inputs in the fair value hierarchy 
valuation of other investments 
the value of our investment in cartesian iris offshore fund lp or in cartesian iris a lp is based on our shares of the capital position of the partnership which includes income and expenses reported by the limited partnership as provided in its quarterly management accounts 
each of cartesian iris offshore fund lp and cartesian iris a lp is subject to annual audit evaluating the financial statements of the partnership 
we periodically review the management accounts of cartesian iris offshore fund lp and cartesian iris a lp and evaluate the reasonableness of the valuation of our investment 
guaranteed investments 
the following table presents the breakdown of investments which are guaranteed by mono line insurers wrapped credit disclosure and those that have explicit government guarantees 
the standalone rating is determined as the senior unsecured debt rating of the issuer 
where the credit ratings were split between the two main rating agencies s p s and moody s  the lowest rating was used 
as at december  as at december  rating with rating without market rating with rating without market guarantee guarantee value guarantee guarantee value in millions in millions aaa aaa aaa aaa aa aa aa aa aa aa a a a a a a bbb bbb bbb bbb bbb bbb bb bb bb bb b b b b aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa a a a a a a bbb bbb aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa a a a a bbb bbb bbb bbb bbb bbb bbb bbb 
table of contents our exposure to mono line insurers was limited to one municipal holding holding as at december  with a market value of million million 
our exposure to other third party guaranteed debt is primarily to investments backed by the federal depository insurance corporation fdic and non us government guaranteed issuers 
other than temporary impairment of investments 
we review all our available for sale investment portfolio on an individual security basis for potential impairment each quarter based on criteria including issuer specific circumstances  credit ratings actions and general macro economic conditions 
the difference between the amortized cost cost and the estimated fair market value of available for sale investments is monitored to determine whether any investment has experienced a decline in value that is believed to be other than temporary 
a security is impaired when the fair value is below its amortized cost cost 
in our review of fixed maturity investments  other than temporary impairment otti is deemed to occur when there is no objective evidence to support recovery in value of a security and a we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its adjusted amortized cost basis or b it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the individual security 
in the first case  the entire unrealized loss position is taken as an otti charge to realized losses in earnings 
in the second case  the unrealized loss is separated into the amount related to credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the otti charge related to credit loss is recognized in realized losses in earnings and the amount related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
the cost basis of the investment is reduced accordingly and no adjustments to the cost basis are made for subsequent recoveries in value 
equity securities do not have a maturity date and therefore our review of these securities utilizes a higher degree of judgment 
in our review  we consider our ability and intent to hold an impaired equity security for a reasonable period of time to allow for a full recovery 
where a security is considered to be other than temporarily impaired  the entire charge is recognized in realized losses in earnings 
again  the cost basis of the investment is reduced accordingly and no adjustments to the cost basis are made for subsequent recoveries in value 
although we review each security on a case by case basis  we have also established parameters to help identify securities in an unrealized loss position which are other than temporarily impaired 
these parameters focus on the extent and duration of the impairment and for both fixed maturities and equities we consider declines in value of greater than for consecutive months to indicate that the security may be other than temporarily impaired 
the total other than temporary impairment for the twelve months ended december  was nil million 
for a discussion of our valuation techniques within the fair value hierarchy  see note of the consolidated financial statements for the twelve months ended december  reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses provision is made at the end of each year for the estimated cost of claims incurred but not settled at the balance sheet date  including the cost of ibnr claims 
the estimated cost of claims includes expenses to be incurred in settling claims and a deduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries 
estimated amounts recoverable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are calculated to arrive at a net claims reserve 
as required under us gaap  no provision is made for our exposure to natural or man made catastrophes other than for events occurring before the balance sheet date 
reserves by segment 
for the twelve months ended december   we had total net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves of  million december   million 
this amount represented our best estimate of the ultimate liability for payment of losses and loss adjustment expenses 
of the total gross reserves for unpaid losses of  million at the balance sheet date of december   a total of  million  or  represented ibnr claims december   million and

the following tables analyze gross and net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by segment as at december  and as at december  as at december  reinsurance reinsurance gross recoverable net gross recoverable net in millions reinsurance insurance total losses and loss expense reserves the increase in reinsurance recoverables in is due predominately to the recognition of recoveries associated with the new zealand earthquake and the thai floods

the increase in reserves in over therefore reflects the reserves associated with the accident year less changes in reserve estimates and payments made on earlier accident years and prior 
for the reinsurance segment  the main events which impacted the reserves in were the earthquakes in japan and new zealand  the australian and thai floods and the us storms while we have seen overall favorable experience from prior years 
the insurance segment did not have material exposure to the catastrophe events of the level of reserves in insurance also reflects prior year releases 
prior year loss reserves 
in the twelve months ended december   and  there was an overall reduction of our estimate of the ultimate claims to be paid 
an analysis of this reduction by segment is as follows twelve months ended twelve months ended twelve months ended business segment december  december  december  in millions reinsurance insurance total reduction in prior year loss reserves 
table of contents for the twelve months ended december  the analysis of the development by each segment is as follows reinsurance 
net reserve releases for the year ended december  in the reinsurance segment were million 
property reinsurance had releases of million  primarily on the risk excess and facultative accounts due to better than expected claims development 
specialty reinsurance had releases of million  primarily in the marine  aviation and contingency accounts as a result of favorable claims experience 
insurance 
net reserve releases for the year ended december  in the insurance segment were million 
better than expected experience in the marine and transportation  property and casualty business lines led to reserve releases of million  million and million  respectively 
this was partially offset with a strengthening in reserves in financial and professional lines of million  primarily in uk professional lines which experienced more than expected claims development affected by the financial crises in prior years 
for the twelve months ended december  the analysis of the development by each segment is as follows reinsurance 
net reserve releases of million in the year were attributed to all of our reinsurance lines 
the largest release was seen in other property reinsurance where we released million due largely to better than expected loss experience 
casualty reinsurance experienced a lower level of releases than in previous years with some areas with exposure to the global financial crisis being strengthened 
we released million from specialty reinsurance spread across several accounts and several years where the experience was better than expected 
insurance 
the net reserve strengthening in the insurance segment of million in was mainly due to both our casualty business and our financial and professional lines 
following a full and detailed review of us casualty insurance  we strengthened reserves by million of which million was in the fourth quarter  reflecting mainly adverse loss experience largely in construction accounts 
other areas of strengthening were in excess casualty and professional lines insurance which were adversely impacted by recession related claims 
this strengthening was partly compensated for by various releases including uk liability where experience was better than expected 
for the twelve months ended december  the analysis of the development by each segment is as follows reinsurance 
the reserve releases in were as a result of better than expected incurred development on nearly all lines in the segment spread across several accident years and including settlement of hurricane ike and gustav claims 
because of ongoing litigation  there remains significant uncertainty as to our ultimate costs of hurricane katrina 
just over half of the million reserve releases came from property with an even split of casualty and specialty releases for the remainder 
most of the casualty favorable development was in our us casualty treaty reinsurance business line where the experience to year end compared with starting loss ratios and expected patterns was generally better than expected at the aggregate level 
insurance 
the million deterioration in the year was the result of strengthening in three out of the four business lines 
we released million from property from better than expected experience 
casualty was strengthened by million which was primarily a result of worse than expected experience in relation to new york contractors liability business offset partially by releases in uk liability which had better than expected experience 
reserve strengthening from financial and professional lines was attributable to increased reserves on the financial institutions line in response to the global financial crisis 
marine  energy and transportation reserves were strengthened from worse than expected development on the accident year in our marine  energy and construction liability account 
other than the matters described above  we did not make any significant changes in assumptions used in our reserving process 
however  because the period of time we have been in operation is 
table of contents relatively short  our loss experience is limited and reliable evidence of changes in trends of numbers of claims incurred  average settlement amounts  numbers of claims outstanding and average losses per claim will necessarily take years to develop

such securities are often referred to as hybrids as they have certain attributes of both debt and equity 
we also monitor the ratio of the total of debt and hybrids to total capital and this stands at as of december  
the principal capital management transactions during and were as follows on february   our board authorized a new repurchase program for up to million of ordinary shares of which million remained available as at december  the authorization for the remaining amount of the repurchase program was extended by the board at its meeting on february  on november   we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program with barclays capital to repurchase million of our ordinary shares 
as of december   a total of  ordinary shares were received and cancelled

we believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds through debt or equity financing 
however  our continuing ability to access the capital markets is dependent on  among other things  market conditions  our operating results and our perceived financial strength 
we regularly monitor our capital and financial position  as well as investment and security market conditions  both in general and with respect to aspen holdings securities

for a more detailed discussion of our operating subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  see note of our consolidated financial statements 
operating subsidiaries 
as of december   the operating subsidiaries held approximately  million  million in cash and short term investments that are readily realizable securities 
management monitors the value  currency and duration of cash and investments held by its operating subsidiaries to ensure that they are able to meet their insurance and other liabilities as they become due and was satisfied that there was a comfortable margin of liquidity as at december  and for the foreseeable future 
on an ongoing basis  our operating subsidiaries sources of funds primarily consist of premiums written  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments 
cash is used primarily to pay reinsurance premiums  losses and loss adjustment expenses  brokerage commissions  general and administrative expenses  taxes  interest and dividends and to purchase new investments 
the potential for individual large claims and for accumulations of claims from single events means that substantial and unpredictable payments may need to be made within relatively short periods of time 
we manage these risks by making regular forecasts of the timing and amount of expected cash outflows and ensuring that we maintain sufficient balances in cash and short term investments to meet these estimates 
notwithstanding this policy  if these cash flow forecasts are incorrect  we could be 
table of contents forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity  potentially at a significant loss 
historically  we have not had to liquidate investments to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity 
the liquidity of the operating subsidiaries is also affected by the terms of contractual obligations to us policyholders and by undertakings to certain regulatory authorities to facilitate the issue of letters of credit or maintain certain balances in trust funds for the benefit of policyholders

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations other than our obligations to employees  our perpetual preferred income equity replacement securities perpetual piers and our perpetual non cumulative preference shares perpetual preference shares under long term debt  operating leases and reserves relating to insurance and reinsurance contracts as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual basis total year years years years in millions operating lease obligations long term debt obligations reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses the long term debt obligations disclosed above do not include the million annual interest payable on our outstanding senior notes 
in estimating the time intervals into which payments of our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses fall  as set out above  we have utilized actuarially assessed payment patterns 
by the nature of the insurance and reinsurance contracts under which these liabilities are assumed  there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods shown and there could be a material acceleration or deceleration of claims payments depending on factors outside our control 
this uncertainty is heightened by the relatively short time in which we have operated  thereby providing limited company specific claims loss payment patterns 
the total amount of payments in respect of our reserves  as well as the timing of such payments  may differ materially from our current estimates for the reasons set out above under critical accounting policies reserves for losses and loss expenses 
we terminated our lease in bermuda on october  and entered into a new lease for new premises  square feet 
the term of the rental lease agreement is for ten years from september   with a break clause at five years and an additional five year option commencing september for our uk based reinsurance and insurance operations  on april   aspen uk signed an agreement following our entry in october into a heads of terms agreement with blct limited the landlord  tamagon limited and cleartest limited in connection with leasing office space in london of approximately a total of  square feet covering three floors 
the term of each lease for each floor commenced in november and runs for years 
in  the building was sold to tishman international 
the terms of the lease remain unchanged 
each lease will be subject to yearly upwards only rent reviews 
we also license office space within the lloyd s building on the basis of a renewable month lease 
we also entered into two new leases for two additional premises in london  square feet total  which expire in december and march each lease has a further negotiable extension provision 
in  we entered into three two year serviced office contracts for arml in bristol  glasgow and birmingham 
we also have entered into leases for office space in locations of our us subsidiary operations 
these locations include boston  massachusetts  rocky hill  connecticut  pasadena  california  manhattan beach  california  atlanta and johns creek  georgia  miami  florida  and jersey city  new jersey 
we have small serviced office contracts in alamo  california  oakbrook  barrington and lisle  illinois  and brookfield  wisconsin 
in  we entered into a five year lease for office space in manhattan  new york  covering  square feet 
an additional floor of  square feet was also leased in manhattan in also  in  we leased a  square foot of office space in chicago  illinois  a  square foot office space in san francisco  california and a small serviced office in houston  texas 
our scottsdale  arizona and alpharetta  georgia offices were closed in 
table of contents our international offices for our subsidiaries include locations with leased office space in paris  zurich  geneva  singapore  cologne and dublin 
we believe that our office space is sufficient for us to conduct our operations for the foreseeable future in these locations 
effects of inflation inflation may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations by its effect on interest rates and on the cost of settling claims 
the potential exists  after a catastrophe or other large property loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy as the demand for services such as construction typically surges 
we believe this had an impact on the cost of claims arising from the hurricanes 
the cost of settling claims may also be increased by global commodity price inflation 
we seek to take both these factors into account when setting reserves for any events where we think they may be material 
our calculation of reserves for losses and loss expenses in respect of casualty business includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
we write casualty business in the united states  the united kingdom and australia and certain other territories  where claims inflation has in many years run at higher rates than general inflation 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims  we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in earnings 
the actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
in addition to general price inflation  we are exposed to a persisting long term upwards trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages 
we seek to take this into account in our pricing and reserving of casualty business 
we also seek to take into account the projected impact of inflation on the likely actions of central banks in the setting of short term interest rates and consequent effects on the yields and prices of fixed interest securities 
as of february  we consider that although inflation is currently low  in the medium term there is a risk that inflation  interest rates and bond yields may rise  resulting in a decrease in the market value of certain of our fixed interest investments 

table of contents reconciliation of non gaap financial measures adjusted diluted book value per ordinary share  a non gaap measure  is calculated by adding back ordinary dividends to shareholders equity at the end of the year 
we believe that adding back ordinary dividends provides a more consistent and useful measurement of total shareholder value  which supplements gaap information 
as at as at december  december  in millions  except for share amounts total shareholders equity preference shares less issue expenses ordinary dividends total shareholders equity ordinary shares diluted ordinary shares as at as at december  december  in millions  except percentages total shareholders equity average preference shares average adjustment average equity average equity  a non gaap financial measure  is calculated by the arithmetic average on a monthly basis for the stated periods excluding i preference shares  ii after tax unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and iii the average after tax unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses 
unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments is primarily the result of interest rate movements and the resultant impact on fixed income securities  and unrealized appreciation depreciation on foreign exchange is the result of exchange rate movements between the us dollar and the british pound 
therefore  we believe that excluding these unrealized appreciations depreciations provides a more consistent and useful measurement of operating performance  which supplements gaap information 
as at as at december  december  in millions  except percentages net income loss after tax add deduct after tax income net realized and unrealized investment gains losses net realized and unrealized exchange gains losses operating income loss after tax operating income  a non gaap financial measure  is an internal performance measure used by us in the management of our operations and represents after tax operational results excluding  as applicable  after tax net realized and unrealized capital gains or losses  after tax net foreign exchange gains or losses and changes in the fair value of derivatives 
we exclude after tax net realized and unrealized capital gains or losses  after tax net foreign exchange gains or losses and changes in the fair value of derivatives from our calculation of operating income because the amount of these gains or losses is heavily influenced by  and fluctuates in part  according to the availability of market opportunities 
we believe these amounts are largely independent of our business and underwriting process and including them 
table of contents distorts the analysis of trends in its operations 
in addition to presenting net income determined in accordance with gaap  we believe that showing operating income enables investors  analysts  rating agencies and other users of our financial information to more easily analyze our results of operations in a manner similar to how management analyzes our underlying business performance 
operating income should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap net income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company believes that it is principally exposed to four types of market risk interest rate risk  equity risk  foreign currency risk and credit risk 
interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income securities 
accordingly  our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income portfolio falls  and the converse is also true 
we manage interest rate risk by maintaining a short to medium duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value 
as at december   we held a number of standard fixed for floating interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of billion due to mature between august  and november  the swaps are part of our ordinary course investment activities to partially mitigate the negative impact of rises in interest rates on the market value of our fixed income portfolio 
as at december   our fixed income portfolio had an approximate duration of years excluding the duration impact of the interest rate swaps 
the table below depicts interest rate change scenarios and the effect on our available for sale and trading assets effect of changes in interest rates on portfolio given a parallel shift in the yield curve movement in rates in basis points in millions  except percentages market value gain loss percentage of portfolio corresponding percentage at december  value at risk var 
we measure var for our portfolio at the confidence level on two different bases that place lower short var or higher long var weights on historical market observations 
at the end of december  our short var was and our long var was 
equity risk 
we have invested in equity securities which had a fair market value of million at december   equivalent to of the total of investments  cash and cash equivalents at that date 
these equity investments are exposed to equity price risk  defined as the potential for loss in market value due to a decline in equity prices 
we believe that the effects of diversification and the relatively small size of our investments in equities relative to total invested assets mitigate our exposure to equity price risk 
foreign currency risk 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
the functional currencies of our operations are us dollars  british pounds  euros  swiss francs  australian dollars  canadian dollars and singaporean dollars 
as of december   approximately of our cash and investments was held in us dollars  approximately were in british pounds and approximately were in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound 
for the twelve months ended december   of our gross premiums were written in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound and we expect that a similar proportion will be written in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound in other foreign currency amounts are remeasured to the appropriate functional currency and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are reflected in the statement of operations 
functional currency 
table of contents amounts of assets and liabilities are then translated into us dollars 
the unrealized gain or loss from this translation  net of tax  is recorded as part of ordinary shareholders equity 
the change in unrealized foreign currency translation gain or loss during the year  net of tax  is a component of comprehensive income 
both the remeasurement and translation are calculated using current exchange rates for the balance sheets and average exchange rates for the statement of operations 
we may experience exchange losses to the extent that our foreign currency exposure is not properly managed or otherwise hedged  which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
management estimates that a change in the exchange rate between british pounds and us dollars as at december  would have impacted reported net comprehensive income by approximately million million 
we will continue to manage our foreign currency risk by seeking to match our liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in these currencies 
this may involve the use of forward exchange contracts from time to time 
a forward foreign currency exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract 
foreign currency exchange contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time 
all realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in the statement of operations as changes in fair value of derivatives 
for the twelve months ended december   the impact of foreign currency contracts on net income was million nil 
credit risk 
as of december   we had million of notional interest rate swaps with goldman that had a net present value npv in our favor of million for which goldman posted collateral to us as of december  with a market value of million 
as at december   we had notional amounts of interest rate swaps of billion with two counterparties  goldman million notional and cr dit agricole million notional under respective isda agreements 
as of december   our swap positions npv under each of our interest rate swaps with goldman and cr dit agricole were negative ie  in favor of goldman and cr dit agricole for which we posted collateral with a market value of million in favor of goldman and million in favor of cr dit agricole 
below is a description of the main processes and procedures we have undertaken to assess the financial strength and ability of our swap counterparties to perform their obligations we have isda master agreements with multiple potential counterparties to diversify our counterparty credit risk exposure as we deem appropriate 
we view senior unsecured debt ratings as the key factor in assessing the financial strength and probability of default of a counterparty 
accordingly  as of december   we have only entered into interest rate swap transactions with swap counterparties who have or whose obligations are guaranteed by an affiliate that has a senior unsecured debt rating of at least a 
as at december   the goldman sachs group the guarantor of the obligations of goldman under the goldman isda agreement was rated a from moody s and a from s p and cr dit agricole was rated aa from moody s and a from s p 
we protected the ability to maintain a minimum counterparty rating by negotiating provisions that permit us to terminate the isda agreements with our counterparties and all interest rate swaps thereunder if the rating of the counterparty or its guarantor fell below certain levels 
our credit exposure to any one swap counterparty is the amount of uncollateralized npv ie  the amount  if any  that the counterparty would owe us upon termination of the swap following a default by the counterparty that is unsecured by collateral that has been delivered by the counterparty to us 
under each isda agreement  we negotiated a maximum amount of unsecured credit risk uncollateralized npv that we can be exposed to before the counterparty is required to post collateral to us 
such amount is called the minimum transfer amount mta 
if an event of default or certain other events such as the downgrade event discussed above  a merger or other 
table of contents combination of the counterparty as a result of which the counterparty is materially weaker  or a change in law has occurred and is continuing with respect to a counterparty  the mta with respect to such party becomes zero  and the counterparty is required to post collateral for all amounts due to us 
the movement in the npv of each interest rate swap is measured on a daily basis and settled on a daily basis if the amount required to be transferred to us is greater than the respective mta of the isda agreement 
collateral required to be posted to us is required to be delivered to a collateral account held by our custodian 
therefore  our exposure to a counterparty s credit risk is recalibrated on a daily basis 
the permitted collateral that can be posted between the parties is cash and us treasuries of various maturities  but not exceeding years 
valuation of the posted collateral is based on the closing market price of the posted treasury from bloomberg and applies a valuation percentage by type of security 
as of december   we estimated our maximum loss due to counterparties defaulting to be in the range of million to million  if we assume daily movement in the value of the swap of between and basis points 
as collateral obligations are calculated on a daily basis  from a counterparty credit risk exposure we focus on the daily movement in the value of the swap 
in the past seven years inclusive  the biggest one day move in the swap market using the year swap as a proxy was basis points 
if that movement were to occur in our favor  then our total exposure to counterparties we have as at december  would be approximately million  approximately million to each counterparty 
we also have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories  business sectors and any one issuer 
as at december   the average rating of fixed income securities in our investment portfolio was aa with the decrease due to s p s downgrade of us government securities in august december  aa 
we also have credit risk through exposure to our swap counterparties who are goldman sachs group senior unsecured rating of a by moody s a by s p and cr dit agricole corporate and investment bank senior unsecured rating of aa by moody s long term issuer credit rating of a by s p 
in addition  we are exposed to the credit risk of our insurance and reinsurance brokers to whom we make claims payments for our policyholders  as well as to the credit risk of our reinsurers and retrocessionaires who assume business from us 
other than fully collateralized reinsurance  the substantial majority of our reinsurers have a rating of a excellent  the third highest of fifteen rating levels  or better by am best and the minimum rating of any of our material reinsurers is a excellent  the fourth highest of fifteen rating levels  by am best 
the table below shows our reinsurance recoverables as of december   and our reinsurers ratings taking into account any changes in ratings as of february  am best in millions a a a a f fully collateralized not rated total the am best rating of f denotes liquidation 
we have not reduced the carrying value of the recoverable from this particular reinsurer as a trust account exists to replace the potentially insufficient reserves
