item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item of this annual report 
in addition  please see information regarding non gaap measures and other on page for a reconciliation of the non gaap measures for adjusted total revenues  organic commission  fee and supplemental commission revenues and adjusted ebitdac to the comparable gaap measures  as well as other important information regarding these measures 
we are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and third party property casualty claims settlement and administration services to entities in the us and abroad 
we believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients 
our brokers  agents and administrators act as intermediaries between insurers and their customers and we do not assume underwriting risks 
we are headquartered in itasca  illinois  have operations in countries and offer client service capabilities in more than countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants 
we generate approximately of our revenues domestically  with the remaining derived internationally  primarily in australia  bermuda  canada  new zealand and the uk we have three reporting segments brokerage  risk management and corporate  which contributed approximately  and  respectively  to revenues 
our major sources of operating revenues are commissions  fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations 
investment income is generated from our investment portfolio  which includes invested cash and fiduciary funds  as well as clean energy and other investments 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results which are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of please see information concerning forward looking statements in part i of this annual report  for certain cautionary information regarding forward looking statements and a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward looking statements 
overview and financial highlights even though we generated positive organic growth in the year ended december  in both our brokerage and risk management segments  the uncertain economic environment continued to provide headwinds for our business in in first quarter  surveys by the council of insurance agents brokers which we refer to as the ciab indicated that commercial property casualty rates had again declined for the th consecutive quarter  although the rate of decrease slowed from that reported in fourth quarter the second quarter report indicated that rates remained stable with negligible declines 
the third quarter report indicated that rates were up  on average  across all sized accounts  with small accounts leading the way with an average increase 
the fourth quarter report indicated that rates were up  on average  across all sized accounts  with medium accounts leading the way with an average increase 
the ciab survey did not reveal any significant new emerging trends  but did note that rates appear to be moving towards positive territory 
although competition is still stiff in the marketplace  the fourth quarter survey indicated that property casualty insurance carriers appear to be tightening their underwriting standards  particularly on accounts with poor loss experience 
the survey also indicated that there is some upward rate pressure on workers compensation and property lines of business 
however  the demand for insurance continues to be restrained due to the sluggish economy  which could offset the impact of the favorable pricing trend noted in the fourth quarter survey 
the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers  who write approximately of the commercial property casualty premiums in the us despite these headwinds  our operating results improved in compared to in both our brokerage and risk management segments in our brokerage segment  total revenues and adjusted total revenues were up and  respectively  organic commission  fee and supplemental commission revenues were up  earnings from continuing operations were up and adjusted ebitdac was up 
in addition  we completed acquisitions totaling million of annualized revenues in in our risk management segment  total revenues and adjusted total revenues were both up  organic revenues were up  earnings from continuing operations were up and adjusted ebitdac was up 
in our combined brokerage and risk management segments  total revenues and adjusted total revenues were up and  respectively  organic commission  fee and supplemental commission revenues were up  earnings from continuing operations were up and adjusted ebitdac was up 
we achieved these results by demonstrating expense discipline and headcount control  continuing to pursue our acquisition strategy and generating organic growth in our core businesses 
in  we continued to expand our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth 
by the end of  of our revenues were generated internationally  compared with in we expect this international revenue trend to continue in 
table of contents insurance market overview fluctuations in premiums charged by property casualty insurance carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry 
commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels 
insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions 
various factors  including competition for market share among insurance carriers  increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations  can result in flat or reduced property casualty premium rates a soft market 
a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues 
various countervailing factors  such as greater than anticipated loss experience and capital shortages  can result in increasing property casualty premium rates a hard market 
a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues 
hard and soft markets may be broad based or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas 
as markets harden  certain insureds  who are the buyers of insurance our brokerage clients  have historically resisted paying increased premiums and the higher commissions these premiums generate 
such resistance often causes some buyers to raise their deductibles and or reduce the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase 
as the market softens  or costs decrease  these trends have historically reversed 
during a hard market  buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks  or may consider the alternative insurance market  which includes self insurance  captives  rent a captives  risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk 
according to industry estimates  these mechanisms now account for of the total us commercial property casualty market 
our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well 
while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us  such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management  claims management  captive insurance and self insurance services and related growth in fee revenue 
inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures  resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions 
however  the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations has historically had a greater impact on changes in premium rates  and therefore on our revenues  than inflationary pressures 
recent events the deterioration in the economy that began in the fall of adversely impacted us in  and could continue to do so in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in  among other things  their headcount  payroll  properties and the market value of their assets 
such reductions could also adversely impact our commission revenues in future years if the property casualty insurance carriers perform exposure audits that lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments 
we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and  as a result  any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy 
in addition  some of our clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy 
during  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act which we refer to together as the health care reform legislation were signed into law 
the health care reform legislation  among other things  increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees 
many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and  therefore  are impacted by the health care reform legislation 
as a result  the potential exists for our employee benefits consultants to win new clients and generate additional revenue from existing clients by assisting them in navigating the increasingly complex regulations surrounding their benefits plans 
in  our employee benefits consulting operation generated approximately one quarter of the brokerage segment s revenues 
although we believe that the health care reform legislation could be beneficial to our brokerage segment s fee revenues  given the legislation s broad scope and the uncertainties that exist regarding the interpretation and implementation of many of the legislation s complex provisions  the potential impact of the legislation on us  beneficial or otherwise  is currently uncertain 
clean energy investments in  we built and placed in service fourteen commercial clean coal production plants era plants 
at december   we held non controlling  minority interests in five limited liability companies that own twelve of the era plants 
these plants are currently producing refined coal using chem mod llc s technologies see below which reduce harmful emissions and that we believe qualify for irc section tax credits 
collectively  these twelve plants operations could generate for us approximately million of net after tax earnings per quarter through at december   we also held a controlling majority interest in a limited liability company that owns two era plants 
while these plants have produced refined coal using chem mod s technologies in the past  they are currently idle 
congress extended the deadline for clean coal production plants to be placed in service by two years  from december  to december  tax credits on these plants can be earned for ten years from the placed in service date if the clean coal production plants are placed in service by december  in conjunction with this extension and the marketing efforts of chem mod  there is increased demand for irc section projects and the chem mod technologies 
accordingly  we have invested million in fifteen commercial clean coal production plants that we placed in service  producing refined coal using chem mod s technologies  prior to december  era plants 

table of contents at december   we held controlling majority interests in seven limited liability companies that own the fifteen era plants 
as of january   we sold majority portions of our investments in six limited liability companies that own five of the plants for a total of million 
these plants are currently producing refined coal under long term purchase commitments with utilities 
collectively  these five plants could generate for us approximately million of net after tax earnings per quarter through we continue to seek and negotiate long term purchase commitments for the remaining ten era plants  all of which are currently idle 
we have non binding agreements in principle with a utility and co investors for one of the era plants 
however  these transactions are not expected to close  and the related production of refined coal at this utility is not expected to begin  until approximately second quarter of this plant could generate for us approximately million of after tax earnings per quarter through it is too early at this time to predict when negotiations and transactions will be complete and what the ultimate earnings potential will be from the remaining nine plants not currently under long term purchase commitments 
ultimately  we plan to sell majority ownership interests in all fifteen era plants and relinquish control of the plants under structures similar to the era plants  thereby becoming a non controlling  minority investor 
we also own a controlling interest in chem mod llc  which has been marketing its chem mod solution technologies principally to coal fired power plants owned by utility companies  including those utilities that are operating with the irc section clean coal production plants in which we hold investments 
to date  permits to utilize chem mod s technologies have been permitted for coal fired utilities in twelve states 
several other states are in the process of granting similar approvals  although we cannot predict the timing of such approvals or whether such approvals will be granted 
based on current production estimates provided by licensees  chem mod could generate for us approximately million of net after tax earnings per quarter 
all estimates set forth above regarding the future quarterly earnings impact of our clean energy investments are subject to significant risks  including those set forth in the risk factors regarding our irc section investments under item a  risk factors 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which we refer to as gaap  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize commission revenues at the later of the billing or the effective date of the related insurance policies  net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations 
we recognize commission revenues related to installment premiums as the installments are billed 
we recognize supplemental commission revenues using internal data and information received from insurance carriers that allows us to reasonably estimate the supplemental commissions earned in the period 
a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid  is determined by the insurance carrier based on historical performance criteria and is established annually in advance of the contractual period 
we recognize contingent commissions and commissions on premiums directly billed by insurance carriers as revenue when we have obtained the data necessary to reasonably determine such amounts 
typically  we cannot reasonably determine these types of commission revenues until we have received the cash or the related policy detail or other carrier specific information from the insurance carrier 
a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit and or volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period 
commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance carriers to the insureds generally relate to a large number of property casualty transactions  each with small premiums  and comprise a substantial portion of the revenues generated by our employee benefit brokerage operations 
under these direct bill arrangements  the insurance carrier controls the entire billing and policy issuance process 
we record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known 
fee revenues generated from the brokerage segment primarily relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions that we recognize in the same manner as commission revenues 
fee revenues generated from the risk management segment relate to third party claims administration  loss control and other risk management consulting services  that we provide over a period of time  typically one year 
we recognize these fee revenues ratably as the services are rendered and record the income effects of subsequent fee adjustments when the adjustments become known 
premiums and fees receivable in our consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations and doubtful accounts 
we establish the allowance for estimated policy cancellations through a charge to revenues and the allowance for doubtful accounts through a charge to other operating expenses 
both of these allowances are based on estimates and assumptions using historical data to project future experience 
such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein 
we periodically review the adequacy of these allowances and make adjustments as necessary 

table of contents income taxes our tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates applicable to our taxable earnings and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions 
we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax return 
we evaluate our tax positions using a two step process 
the first step involves recognition 
we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the position 
the technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  we do not recognize the benefit of that position in the financial statements 
the second step is measurement 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of greater than of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 
uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment 
subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition  derecognition and measurement 
adjustments may result  for example  upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities  or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the possibility that our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than such items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the annual tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in the tax returns 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns  and some differences are temporary and reverse over time  such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred  or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements 
we establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in a specific jurisdiction 
in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis 
negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years 
positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction  tax planning strategies that would result in the realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years 
the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable 
intangible assets earnout obligations intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses 
our primary intangible assets are classified as either goodwill  expiration lists  non compete agreements or trade names 
expiration lists  non compete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists  three to five years for non compete agreements and ten to fifteen years for trade names  while goodwill is not subject to amortization 
the establishment of goodwill  expiration lists  non compete agreements and trade names and the determination of estimated useful lives are primarily based on valuations we receive from qualified independent appraisers 
the calculations of these amounts are based on estimates and assumptions using historical and pro forma data and recognized valuation methods 
different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 
we carry intangible assets at cost  less accumulated amortization in our consolidated balance sheet 
we review all of our intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we perform these impairment reviews at the reporting unit level with respect to goodwill and at the business unit level for amortizable intangible assets 
in reviewing intangible assets  if the fair value were less than the carrying amount of the respective or underlying asset  an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings 
based on the results of impairment reviews in and  we wrote off million and million  respectively  of amortizable intangible assets related to prior year acquisitions of our brokerage segment 
no such indicators were noted in the determinations of impairment indicators and fair value are based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates 
different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 
effective january   we adopted  on a prospective basis  revised guidance to account for our acquisitions  including the estimation and recognition of the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of our acquisitions from and into the future  whose purchase agreements contain such provisions 
subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred 
potential earnout 
table of contents obligations are typically based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired businesses 
for acquisitions made prior to january   we did not include such obligations in the purchase price recorded for each applicable acquisition at the acquisition date because such obligations are not fixed and determinable 
we generally record future payments made under these and prior arrangements  if any  as additional goodwill when the earnouts are settled  which will have no impact on the amounts reported in our consolidated statement of earnings 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our business combinations 
business combinations and dispositions see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our business combinations 
we did not have any material dispositions in  or historically  we have used acquisitions to grow our brokerage segment s commission and fee revenues 
acquisitions allow us to expand into desirable geographic locations and further extend our presence in the retail and wholesale insurance brokerage services industries 
we expect that our brokerage segment s commission and fee revenues will continue to grow from acquisitions 
we intend to continue to consider from time to time  additional acquisitions for our brokerage and risk management segments on terms that we deem advantageous 
at any particular time  we are generally engaged in discussions with multiple acquisition candidates 
however  we can make no assurances that any additional acquisitions will be consummated  or  if consummated  that they will be advantageous to us 
results of operations information regarding non gaap measures and other in the discussion that follows regarding our results of operations  we provide information regarding ebitdac  ebitdac margin  adjusted ebitdac  adjusted ebitdac margin  adjusted ebitdac margin excluding heath lambert  diluted earnings from continuing operations per share as adjusted  organic change in commission  fee and supplemental commission revenues  adjusted revenues  expenses and earnings from continuing operations  adjusted compensation ratio and adjusted operating expense ratio 
these measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative to  the gaap information provided in this report 
we believe that these presentations provide useful information to management  analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition 
our industry peers may provide similar supplemental non gaap information  although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments 
the non gaap information we provide should be used in addition to  but not as a substitute for  the gaap information provided 
certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts reported in this report in order to conform them to the current year presentation 
adjusted presentation we believe that the adjusted presentation of our  and statements of earnings  presented on the following pages  provides stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain of our financial metrics that may assist such persons in analyzing our operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for us 
the after tax amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the effective tax rate for each respective period 
adjusted revenues  expenses and earnings from continuing operations we define these measures as revenues  expenses including compensation expense and operating expense and earnings from continuing operations  respectively  each adjusted to exclude gains realized from sales of books of business  supplemental commission timing amounts  workforce related charges  lease termination related charges  acquisition related integration costs  litigation settlements and adjustments to the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  as applicable 
acquisition related integration costs include costs related to transactions not expected to occur on an ongoing basis in the future once we fully assimilate the applicable acquisition 
these costs are typically associated with redundant workforce  extra lease space  duplicate services and external costs incurred to assimilate the acquisition on to our it related systems 
adjusted ratios adjusted compensation expense ratio and adjusted operating expense ratio are defined as adjusted compensation expense and adjusted operating expense  respectively  each divided by adjusted revenues 
earnings measures we believe that the presentation of ebitdac  ebitdac margin  adjusted ebitdac  adjusted ebitdac margin  adjusted ebitdac margin excluding heath lambert and diluted earnings from continuing operations per share as adjusted provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance 
we consider ebitdac and ebitdac margin as a way to measure financial performance on an ongoing basis 
adjusted ebitdac  adjusted ebitdac margin  adjusted ebitdac margin excluding heath lambert and diluted earnings from continuing operations per share as adjusted are presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of items that have a high degree of variability 
ebitdac we define this measure as earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables 
ebitdac margin we define this measure as ebitdac divided by total revenues 
adjusted ebitdac we define this measure as ebitdac adjusted to exclude gains realized from sales of books of business  supplemental commission timing amounts  earnout related compensation charges  workforce related charges  lease termination related charges  acquisition related costs  litigation settlements and the period over period impact of foreign currency translation 

table of contents adjusted ebitdac margin we define this measure as adjusted ebitdac divided by total revenues  as adjusted to exclude gains realized from sales of books of business and supplemental commission timing amounts 
adjusted ebitdac margin excluding heath lambert we define this measure as adjusted ebitdac further adjusted to exclude the ebitdac associated with the acquired heath lambert operations divided by total revenues  as adjusted to exclude gains realized from sales of books of business  supplemental commission timing amounts and the revenues associated with the acquired heath lambert operations 
diluted earnings from continuing operations per share as adjusted we define this measure as earnings from continuing operations adjusted to exclude the after tax impact of gains realized from sales of books of business  supplemental commission timing amounts  workforce related charges  lease termination related charges  acquisition related integration costs  litigation settlements and adjustments to the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding 
organic revenues organic change in commission and fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions accounted for as purchases and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented 
these commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine the change in organic revenues associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year 
in addition  change in organic revenues excludes the impact of supplemental and contingent commission revenues and the period over period impact of foreign currency translation 
the amounts excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by applying current year foreign exchange rates to the same prior year periods

other information allocations of investment income and certain expenses are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates primarily using revenue  headcount and other information 
we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments as if those segments were computing income tax provisions on a separate company basis 
as a result  the provision for income taxes for the corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to us of the irc section credits generated in  because that is the segment which produced the credits 
the law that provides for irc section credits expires on december  for our related investments 
we anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately to in both our brokerage segment and our risk management segment for the foreseeable future 
reported operating results by segment would change if different allocation methods were applied 
in the discussion that follows regarding our results of operations  we also provide the following ratios with respect to our operating results pretax profit margin  compensation expense ratio and operating expense ratio 
pretax profit margin represents pretax earnings from continuing operations divided by total revenues 
the compensation expense ratio is compensation expense divided by total revenues 
the operating expense ratio is operating expense divided by total revenues 
brokerage the brokerage segment accounted for of our revenue from continuing operations in our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations 
our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place property casualty  employer provided health and welfare insurance and retirement solutions  principally for middle market commercial  industrial  public entity  religious and not for profit entities 
many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters  while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as self insurance pools  risk retention groups or captive insurance companies 
our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized  unique and hard to place insurance programs 
our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance companies  which are usually based upon a percentage of the premium paid by insureds  and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients 
for wholesale brokerage services  we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker from the insurer 
commission rates are dependent on a number of factors  including the type of insurance  the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker 
advisory fees are dependent on the extent and value of services we provide 
in addition  under certain circumstances  both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent commissions 
a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid  is determined by the insurance carrier and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria 
a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit and or volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period

heath lambert for cash  net of cash received  of million million as of the acquisition date 
heath lambert sells nearly all lines of property casualty and employee benefit insurance products through  professionals in offices throughout the uk the transaction is expected to generate approximately million to million in annualized revenue

as previously disclosed  many insurance carriers have provided sufficient information for us to recognize supplemental commission revenues on a quarterly basis for a majority of our and supplemental commission arrangements 
however  in and prior years  most carriers only provided this information on an annual basis after the end of the contract period 
accordingly  the amounts reported in the table below include both a full year of supplemental commission revenues and supplemental commission revenues that were recognized by us on a quarterly basis 
this situation did not occur in and should not occur in or later years  as we anticipate that most of the carriers will continue to provide information on a quarterly basis sufficient to allow recognition of revenues in a similar manner in future quarters

depreciation the increases in depreciation expense in compared to and in compared to were due primarily to the purchases of furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves  and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems 
also contributing to the increases in depreciation expense in  and were the depreciation expenses associated with acquisitions completed during these years 
amortization the increases in amortization in compared to and in compared to were due primarily to amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisitions completed during these years 
expiration lists  non compete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists and three to five years for non compete agreements and ten years for trade names 
based on the results of impairment reviews in and  we wrote off million and million of amortizable intangible assets related to the brokerage segment acquisitions 
no such indicators of impairment were noted in change in estimated acquisition earnout payables the increase in income from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in compared to and compared to was due primarily to adjustments made to the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance 
during  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our  and acquisitions 
during and  we recognized million and million of income  respectively  related to net adjustments in the estimated fair market values of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for and acquisitions  respectively 
the amounts initially recorded as earnout payables for our  and acquisitions are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to three year period subsequent to the acquisition date 
the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements 
in determining fair value  we estimate the acquired entity s future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that are derived for revenue growth and or profitability 
we estimate future earnout payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections 
subsequent changes in the underlying financial projections or assumptions will cause the estimated earnout obligations to change and such adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred 
increases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of expense and decreases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of income 

table of contents the income generated from the net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations in and  was primarily related to our acquisition of the policy renewal rights from liberty mutual and the wausau signature agency which we refer to as liberty mutual in february as part of this transaction we acquired over producers  account managers and service staff from liberty mutual 
due to the underlying market conditions existing in early at the date of the transaction a deteriorating economy and uncertainty of when it would recover and the significant uncertainties related to this transaction that could affect the performance of the liberty mutual business we purchased the policy renewal rights related to liberty mutual s middle market commercial p c business located in their midwest and southeast regions as opposed to buying a stand alone brokerage agency  a portion of the liberty business was co brokered  the extent of which was not known by liberty mutual at the time of the acquisition  and the risks associated with moving captive agents to an open brokerage environment  we structured this acquisition such that approximately of the maximum purchase price was based on a three year earn out period 
we paid approximately million as of the acquisition date  with a potential maximum earnout payable of up to million  to be paid in second quarter as of the acquisition date  we initially estimated and recorded an earnout payable of approximately million based on financial projections that incorporated assumptions to address the risks noted above 
we have been monitoring and updating the financial projections for this business using actual results during the earnout period and have made adjustments to the recorded earnout payable  when applicable 
over the last few quarters  we have seen some deterioration in client retention related to this business primarily due to co brokered business and have been rationalizing staffing levels  which has resulted in downward adjustments to our estimated financial projections and a decrease in the recorded earnout payable

income loss from unconsolidated clean coal production plants this includes income losses related to our equity portion of the pretax results of the twelve clean coal production plants discussed above and the production based income from the investors in the twelve operations 
the increased pretax loss in compared to was due to the nine high volume production plants incurring fixed expenses during the period that they were not producing refined coal  and as a result  we were not earning monetization income during that same time period

clean energy investments in we built and placed in service fourteen commercial clean coal production plants era plants 
at december   we held non controlling  minority interests in five limited liability companies that own twelve era plants 
these plants are currently producing refined coal using chem mod llc s technologies see below which reduce harmful emissions and that we believe qualify for irc section tax credits 
collectively  these twelve plants operations could generate for us approximately million of net after tax earnings per quarter through at december   we also held a controlling  majority interest in a limited liability company that owns two era plants 
while these plants have produced refined coal using chem mod s technologies in the past  they are currently idle 
congress extended the deadline for clean coal production plants to be placed in service by two years  from december  to december  tax credits on these plants can be earned for ten years from the placed in service date if the clean coal production plants are placed in service by december  in conjunction with this extension and the marketing efforts of chem mod  there is increased demand for irc section projects and the chem mod technologies 
accordingly  we have invested million in fifteen commercial clean coal production plants that we placed in service  producing refined coal using chem mod s technologies  prior to december  era plants 
at december   we held controlling majority interests in seven limited liability companies that own the fifteen era plants 
as of january   we sold majority portions of our investments in six limited liability companies that own five of the plants for million 
these plants are currently producing refined coal under long term purchase commitments with utilities 
collectively  these five plants could generate for us approximately million of net after tax earnings per quarter through we continue to seek and negotiate long term purchase commitments for the remaining ten era plants which are currently idle 
our net carrying value of these investments at december  was million 
we estimate that we will invest an additional net million to house each of these plants prior to the resumption of production 
we have non binding agreements in principle with a utility and co investors for one of the era plants 
however  these transactions and the related resumption of production is not expected until the second quarter of this plant could generate for us approximately million of after tax earnings per quarter through it is too early at this time to predict when negotiations and transactions will be complete and what the ultimate earnings potential will be from the remaining nine era plants not currently under long term purchase commitments 
ultimately  we plan to sell majority ownership interests in all fifteen era plants and relinquish control of the plants under structures similar to the era plants  thereby becoming a non controlling  minority investor 
we also own a controlling interest in chem mod llc  which has been marketing its chem mod solution technologies principally to coal fired power plants owned by utility companies  including those utilities that are operating with the irc section clean coal production plants in which we hold investments 
to date  permits to utilize chem mod s technologies have been permitted for coal fired utilities in twelve states 
several other states are in the process of granting similar approvals 
based on current production estimates provided by licensees  chem mod could generate for us approximately million of net after tax earnings per quarter 

table of contents all estimates set forth above regarding the future quarterly earnings impact of our clean energy investments are subject to significant risks  including those set forth in the risk factors regarding our irc section investments under item a  risk factors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these investments 
discontinued operations in  we signed definitive agreements to sell substantially all of our reinsurance brokerage business 
in  we signed and closed a definitive agreement to sell all of the remaining run off obligations of our us reinsurance brokerage operations 
under the agreement  we transferred restricted cash of million  receivables of million and liabilities of million to the buyer 
also in  we recorded million in lease termination and other real estate costs while winding down the remaining leased facilities of the reinsurance brokerage operations 
in addition  we wrote off million in receivables in related to the potential additional contingent proceeds from the initial sale transactions that were recognized in in  as part of integrating the operations of a london based insurance brokerage firm acquired by us on april  and other real estate consolidation initiatives  we restored into service certain leased real estate space that was abandoned in as part of the wind down of certain of our discontinued operations

financial condition and liquidity liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations 
the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive 
historically  our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock  repurchases of our common stock  funding of our investments  acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 
cash flows from operating activities historically  we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet our cash requirements 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
however  to fund acquisitions made during and  we relied to a large extent on proceeds from borrowings  which were repaid before the end of fourth quarter  under our credit agreements 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to favorable timing differences in the receipts and disbursements of fiduciary funds and in the payment of accrued liabilities and to an increased amount of non cash charges in compared to the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to timing differences between periods related to cash collections of premiums and fees receivable and cash disbursements of premiums payable and improved operating results in compared to our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations  as adjusted for realized gains and losses  and our non cash expenses  which include depreciation  amortization  change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  deferred compensation  restricted stock  and stock based and other noncash compensation expenses 
when assessing our overall liquidity  we believe that the focus should be on net earnings from continuing operations  adjusted for non cash items ie  ebitdac  as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
we believe that these items are indicators of trends in liquidity 
from a balance sheet perspective  the focus should not be on premiums and fees receivable  premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity 
net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable 
we believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity  they should be looked at in a combined manner  because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments  both to and from us 
in addition  funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients claim funds held by us in a fiduciary capacity are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash and have not been included in determining our overall liquidity 
our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc 
the employee retirement security act of  as amended which we refer to as erisa  currently imposes a minimum funding requirements for our plan 
the minimum funding requirement under the irc was million in both and we were not required to make a minimum contribution in the plan s actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements 
funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance  the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and or liabilities of the plan 
in addition  amounts funded in the future  to the extent not due under regulatory requirements  may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows  including dividends  acquisitions and common stock repurchases 
during  and  we made discretionary contributions to the plan of million  million and million  respectively 
we are considering making additional discretionary contributions to the plan in and may be required to make significantly larger minimum contributions to the 
table of contents plan in future periods 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit postretirement plans 
we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans which we refer to together as the plans 
the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plans is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings loss  net of tax  in our consolidated balance sheet 
we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings  as appropriate  in the year in which they occur 
numerous items may lead to a change in funded status of the plans  including actual results differing from prior estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates 
in  the funded status of the plans was significantly impacted by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december  the change in funded status of the plans resulted in an increase in noncurrent liabilities of million  including a related adjustment to tax benefits of million and a reduction of our stockholders equity of million in while the change in funded status of the plans had no direct impact on our cash flows from operations in  or  changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods 
cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures net capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in  we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately million  primarily related to office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment

during  and  we sold several books of business and recognized one time gains of million  million and million  respectively 
we received cash proceeds of million  million and million related to these transactions 
clean energy investments we have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under irc section we believe these investments will increase our cash flows and liquidity by generating tax credits that reduce our tax payments in future periods 
please see clean energy investments beginning on page for a more detailed description of these investments including the reference therein to risks and uncertainties outlook we believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our short and long term cash flow needs 
except for and  our earnings from continuing operations before income taxes  adjusted for non cash items ie  ebitdac  have increased year over year since in  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges related to real estate lease terminations  severance  litigation  impairments of intangible assets and the adverse impact of foreign currency translation 
in  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges incurred for litigation and retail contingent commission related matters and claims handling obligations 
we expect the historically favorable trend in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes  adjusted for non cash items  to continue in the foreseeable future because we intend to continue to expand our business through organic growth from existing operations and growth through acquisitions 
additionally  we anticipate a favorable impact on the amount we will pay the irs in and in future years based on anticipated tax credits from irc section investments 
we also anticipate that we will continue to use cash flows from operations and  if needed  borrowings under the credit agreement described below under cash flows from financing activities and our common stock to fund acquisitions 
in addition  we may from time to time consider other 
table of contents alternatives for longer term funding sources 
such alternatives could include raising additional capital through public or private debt offerings  equity markets  or restructuring our operations in the event that cash flows from operations are reduced dramatically due to lost business 
cash flows from financing activities on july   we entered into an unsecured multicurrency credit agreement which we refer to as the credit agreement  which expires on july   with a group of twelve financial institutions 
the credit agreement replaced a million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire on october   which was terminated upon the execution of the credit agreement 
all indebtedness  liabilities and obligations outstanding under the prior facility were fully paid and satisfied  except for outstanding letters of credit which became letters of credit under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit commitment of up to million  of which up to million may be used for issuances of standby or commercial letters of credit and up to million may be used for the making of swing loans as defined in the credit agreement 
we may from time to time request  subject to certain conditions  an increase in the revolving credit commitment up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of million 
in  and we entered into separate note purchase agreements  with certain accredited institutional investors  pursuant to which we issued and sold to the investors million  million and million in aggregate debt  respectively 
at december   we had million of corporate related borrowings outstanding under the three note purchase agreements and a cash and cash equivalent balance of million 
we also use our credit agreement from time to time to borrow funds to supplement operating cash flows 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement 
there were million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december  due to the outstanding borrowing and letters of credit  million remained available for potential borrowings under the credit agreement at december  during  we borrowed million and repaid million under the credit agreement 
principal uses of the borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions  earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
during  we borrowed and repaid million under the credit agreement 
principal uses of the borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions  earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
during  we borrowed and repaid million and million  respectively  under a previous credit agreement 
principal uses of the borrowings under a previous credit agreement were to fund acquisitions completed in  earnout payments related to acquisitions completed prior to and general corporate purposes 
the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement contain various covenants that require us to maintain specified levels of net worth and financial leverage ratios 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  dividends our board of directors determines our dividend policy 
our board of directors declares dividends on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings  our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets 
in  we declared million in cash dividends on our common stock  or per common share 
on january   we paid a fourth quarter dividend of 
per common share to shareholders of record as of december  on january   we announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter of 
per common share  a increase over the prior quarter 
if the dividend is maintained at 
per common share throughout  this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in of approximately million based on the outstanding shares as of december   or an increase in cash used of approximately million 
we can make no assurances regarding the amount of any future dividend payments 
common stock repurchases we have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors 
we did not repurchase any shares in  or we generally hold repurchased shares for reissuance in connection with our equity compensation and stock option plans 
under the provisions of the repurchase plan  we were authorized to repurchase approximately  additional shares at december  the plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices as we may deem advantageous  in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular amount of common stock  and the share repurchase plan can be suspended at any time at our discretion 
funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources  including cash from operations  short term or long term borrowings under our credit agreement or other sources 
the common stock repurchases reported in our consolidated statement of cash flows for  and include  shares at a cost of million   shares at a cost of million and  shares at a cost of million  respectively  that we repurchased from our employees to cover their income tax withholding obligations in connection with restricted stock distributions in each of those years 
under these circumstances  we withhold the proceeds from the repurchases and remit them to the taxing authorities on the employees behalf to cover their income tax withholding obligations 

table of contents common stock issuances another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were million in  million in and million in prior to  we issued stock options under four stock option based employee compensation plans 
the options were primarily granted at the fair value of the underlying shares at the date of grant and generally become exercisable at the rate of per year beginning the calendar year after the date of grant 
on may   our stockholders approved the long term incentive plan which we refer to as the ltip  which replaced our previous stockholder approved long term incentive plan 
all of our officers  employees and non employee directors are eligible to receive awards under the ltip 
awards which may be granted under the ltip include non qualified and incentive stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock units and performance units any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria 
stock options with respect to million shares less any shares of restricted stock issued under the ltip million shares of our common stock were available for this purpose were available for grant under the ltip at december  in addition  we have an employee stock purchase plan which allows our employees to purchase our common stock at of its fair market value 
proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities in and we believe this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future 
shelf registration statement on may   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec  registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of our common stock 
as previously disclosed  we have used this registration statement to register for re sale shares of our common stock issued as acquisition consideration  but we have not issued any shares under this registration statement 
the availability of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement depends on investor demand  market conditions and other factors 
we can make no assurances regarding when  or if  we will issue any shares under this registration statement 
contractual obligations and commitments in connection with our investing and operating activities  we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments 
our future minimum cash payments  excluding interest  associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our note purchase agreements and credit agreement  operating leases and purchase commitments as of december  are as follows in millions payments due by period contractual obligations thereafter total note purchase agreements credit agreement total debt obligations operating lease obligations less sublease arrangements outstanding purchase obligations total contractual obligations the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements  because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
note purchase agreements on august   we entered into a note purchase agreement  as amended and restated on december   with certain accredited institutional investors  pursuant to which we issued and sold million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes  series a  due august  and million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes  series b  due august   in a private placement 
on november   we entered into another note purchase agreement  with certain accredited institutional investors  pursuant to which we issued and sold million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes  series c  due in three equal installments on each of november   november  and november   in a private placement 
on february   we entered into another note purchase agreement  with certain accredited institutional investors  pursuant to which we issued and sold million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes  series d  due february  and million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes  series e  due february   in a private placement 

table of contents see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements 
credit agreement we have a million credit agreement  which expires on july   with a group of twelve financial institutions 
we use the credit agreement to post letters of credit and to borrow funds to supplement our operating cash flows from time to time 
at december   million of letters of credit for which we have million of liabilities recorded at december  were outstanding under the credit agreement 
there were million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december  accordingly  at december   million remained available for potential borrowings  of which million may be in the form of additional letters of credit 
we are under no obligation to use the credit agreement in performing our normal business operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement 
operating lease obligations we generally operate in leased premises at our other locations 
certain of these leases have options permitting renewals for additional periods 
in addition to minimum fixed rentals  a number of leases contain annual escalation clauses which are generally related to increases in an inflation index 
we have leased certain office space to several non affiliated tenants under operating sublease arrangements 
in the normal course of business  we expect that the leases will not be renewed or replaced 
we adjust charges for real estate taxes and common area maintenance annually based on actual expenses  and we recognize the related revenues in the year in which the expenses are incurred 
these amounts are not included in the minimum future rentals to be received in the contractual obligations table above 
outstanding purchase obligations as a service company  we typically do not have a material amount of outstanding purchase obligations at any point in time 
the amount disclosed in the contractual obligations table above represents the aggregate amount of unrecorded purchase obligations that we have outstanding as of december  these obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that were executed in the normal course of business 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet commitments our total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit and funding commitments as of december  are as follows in millions amount of commitment expiration by period total amounts committed off balance sheet commitments thereafter letters of credit funding commitments total commitments since commitments may expire unused  the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to our corporate segment and the off balance sheet debt section below for a discussion of other letters of credit 
all of the letters of credit represent multiple year commitments that have annual  automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date 
since january   we have acquired companies  all of which were accounted for using the acquisition method for recording business combinations 
substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations 
for all of our  and acquisitions that contain potential earnout obligations  such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration for the respective acquisition 
the aggregate amount of the maximum potential earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was million  of which million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made 
the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two to three year period subsequent to the acquisition date 
for acquisitions made prior to  we did not include potential earnout obligations in the recorded purchase price for each applicable acquisition at its respective acquisition date because such obligations are not fixed and determinable 
we will generally record future payments made related to and prior acquisitions  if any  as additional goodwill when the earnouts are settled 
the aggregate amount recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  related to earnout payables for acquisitions we made prior to january  was million 
there were no unrecorded earnout payables outstanding at december  related to acquisitions we made prior to january  off balance sheet debt our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where our ownership interest is between and  in which management has determined that our level of control and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation 
as a result  these investments are accounted for using the equity method 
none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december  and that was recourse to us 

table of contents at december   we had posted two letters of credit totaling million  in the aggregate  related to our self insurance deductibles  for which we have recorded a liability of million 
we have an equity investment in a rent a captive facility  which we use as a placement facility for certain of our insurance brokerage operations 
at december   we had posted million of letters of credit to allow the rent a captive facility to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements and for additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity 
these letters of credit have never been drawn upon 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks in our day to day operations 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by us at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and equity prices 
the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
this discussion of market risks related to our consolidated balance sheet includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks 
the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from our estimates 
in the ordinary course of business  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable  including credit risk and legal risk 
these risks are not included in the following analyses 
our invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents  which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk 
the fair value of our cash and our cash equivalents investment portfolio as of december  approximated its carrying value due to its short term duration 
we estimated market risk as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash equivalents investment portfolio 
the resulting fair values were not materially different from their carrying values at december  we have other investments that have valuations that are indirectly influenced by equity market and general economic conditions  which can change rapidly 
in addition  some investments require direct and active financial and operational support from us 
a future material adverse effect may result from changes in market conditions or if we elect to withdraw financial or operational support 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our note purchase agreements 
the aggregate fair value of these borrowings at december  was million due to the long term duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations 
no active or observable market exists for our private placement long term debt 
therefore  the estimated fair value of this debt is based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities 
to estimate an all in interest rate for discounting  we obtained market quotes for notes with the same terms as ours  which we have deemed to be the closest approximation of current market rates 
we have not adjusted this rate for risk profile changes  covenant issues or credit rating changes 
we estimated market risk as the potential impact on the value of the debt recorded in our consolidated balance sheet resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate as of december  and the resulting fair values would be million higher than their carrying value or million 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement 
the fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their short term duration and variable interest rates 
market risk would be estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in our weighted average short term borrowing rate at december  and the resulting fair values would not be materially different from their carrying values 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from our uk based brokerage subsidiaries that incur expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of their revenues in us dollars 
in addition  we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from our australian  brazilian  canadian  indian and singaporean operations because we transact business in their local denominated currencies 
foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes as transactions occur 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change of in the average foreign currency exchange rate for a weakening of the us dollar  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes would decrease by approximately million 
assuming a hypothetical favorable change of in the average foreign currency exchange rate for a strengthening of the us dollar  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes would increase by approximately million 
we are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars 
however  it is management s opinion that this foreign currency exchange risk is not material to our consolidated operating results or financial position 
we manage the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries  where practical  such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets  maintaining a balanced book which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations 
historically  we have not entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in the uk  we have periodically purchased financial instruments when market opportunities arose to minimize our exposure to this risk 
during  and  we had several monthly put call options in place with an external financial institution that are designed to hedge a significant portion of our future uk currency disbursements through various future payment dates 
in addition  during fourth quarter  we had several monthly put call 
table of contents options in place with an external financial institution that are designed to hedge a significant portion of our future indian currency disbursements through various future payment dates 
these hedging strategies are designed to protect us against significant uk and india currency exchange rate movements  but we are still exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk for the portion of our payments and currency exchange rate that are unhedged 
the impact of these hedging strategies was not material to our consolidated financial statements for  and see note to our consolidated financial statements for the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments reflected in other comprehensive earnings in  and
