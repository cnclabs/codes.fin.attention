item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is a summary of certain factors that management considers important in reviewing the company s results of operations  financial position  liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations the following table contains results of operations for fiscal years and and the dollar and percentage changes for those periods in thousands  except percentages 
change change net sales by category bedding  blankets and accessories    bibs  bath and disposable products    total net sales cost of products sold gross profit of net sales marketing and administrative expenses of net sales interest expense other income income tax expense income from continuing operations discontinued operations net of taxes net income of net sales net sales sales decreased  or million  from fiscal year to fiscal year  with such decrease consisting of a decrease  or million  in sales of bedding  blankets and accessories and a decrease  or million  in sales of bib  bath and disposable products 
the overall decline in sales was primarily due to lower sell through at retail and the transitioning away from an unprofitable private label bedding program 
gross profit gross profit decreased in amount by  but increased as a percentage of net sales from to  from fiscal year to fiscal year the decreases in amount followed the decline in sales  while the increase as a percentage of net sales was due to the redesign of several product lines to reduce the company s dependency on cotton  the cost of which reached record setting levels in fiscal year the discontinuance of an unprofitable private label bedding program mentioned above also contributed to higher margins and countered the decline in sales 
the company s gross profit for fiscal year was also positively impacted by the decline in amortization costs related to the company s acquisition of the baby products line of springs global us on november   which were  lower than in fiscal year marketing and administrative expenses marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year decreased in amount and as a percentage of net sales as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a decline of  in overall compensation costs 
also  professional fees associated with certain corporate governance and shareholder issues were  lower in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest expense the decrease in interest expense for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is due to lower average balances on the company s credit facilities 
income tax expense the company s provision for income taxes on continuing operations decreased to during fiscal year from in fiscal year the decline in the effective tax rate is due to a decrease in the current year in the amount of certain expenses which are not deductible for tax purposes  as well as an increase in state enterprise zone wage credits 
the company previously disclosed in its quarterly reports on form q that the internal revenue service irs had commenced an examination of the company s consolidated federal income tax return for the fiscal year ended march  the irs notified the company on march  that it had closed the examination with no proposed adjustment to the positions taken by the company on such tax return 
inflation the company has endeavored to increase its prices to offset inflationary increases in its raw materials and other costs  but there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in maintaining such price increases or in effecting such price increases in a manner that will provide a timely match to the cost increases 
known trends and uncertainties the company s financial results are closely tied to sales to the company s top three customers  which represented approximately of the company s gross sales in fiscal year a significant downturn experienced by any or all of these customers could lead to pressure on the company s revenues 
the company has also faced higher raw material costs  primarily cotton  as well as increases in labor  transportation and currency costs associated with the company s sourcing activities in china 
continued increases in these costs will adversely affect the profitability of the company if it cannot pass the cost increases along to its customers in the form of price increases or if the timing of price increases does not closely match the cost increases  or if the company cannot continue to reduce its dependence on cotton 
for a further discussion of trends  uncertainties and other factors that could impact the company s operating results  see risk factors in item a 
financial position  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended april   compared to million for the year ended april  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in inventory  accounts payable and accounts receivable balances 
net cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal year compared million in the prior year 
cash used in investing activities in the prior year was primarily associated with the company s acquisition of the bibsters line of disposable bibs 
net cash used in financing activities was million in the current year compared to  in the prior year 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher net repayments in the current year on the company s revolving line of credit 
from april  to april   the company used the bulk of its net cash provided by operating activities to pay off million in debt owed under the company s credit facilities before the reduction for the original issue discount on the company s non interest bearing subordinated notes payable 
such payments consisted of net repayments of million on the company s revolving line of credit and payments made in july of million in the aggregate for the remaining balance due on the subordinated notes payable 
the company also paid million in cash dividends on its common stock during fiscal year the company s future performance is  to a certain extent  subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond its control 
based upon the current level of operations  the company believes that its cash flow from operations and availability on its revolving line of credit will be adequate to meet its liquidity needs 
at april  and april   the company s long term debt consisted of the following in thousands april  april  revolving line of credit non interest bearing notes original issue discount less current maturities the company s credit facility at april  consisted of a revolving line of credit under a financing agreement with the cit group commercial services  inc cit of up to million  which includes a million sub limit for letters of credit  with an interest rate of prime plus  which was at april   or libor plus  which was at april   maturing on july  and secured by a first lien on all assets of the company 
as of april   the company had elected to pay interest on the revolving line of credit under the libor option 
also under the financing agreement  a monthly fee is assessed based on of the average unused portion of the million revolving line of credit  less any outstanding letters of credit 
this unused line fee amounted to  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
at april   there was no balance owed on the revolving line of credit  there was no letter of credit outstanding and the company had million available under the revolving line of credit based on its eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances 
the financing agreement was amended effective as of april  to provide for the payment by cit to the company of interest at the rate of prime minus  which was at april   on daily negative balances outstanding under the revolving line of credit  and to permit the payment by the company of cash dividends on its common stock without limitation  provided there is no default before or as a result of the payment of such dividends 
the financing agreement contains usual and customary covenants for agreements of that type  including limitations on other indebtedness  liens  transfers of assets  investments and acquisitions  merger or consolidation transactions  transactions with affiliates  and changes in or amendments to the organizational documents for the company and its subsidiaries 
to reduce its exposure to credit losses  the company assigns the majority of its trade accounts receivable to cit pursuant to factoring agreements  which expire in july the factoring agreements were amended and restated effective as of april   under which cit will remit customer payments to the company as such payments are received by cit 
under the terms of the factoring agreements in effect prior to april   cit remitted payments to the company on the average due date of each group of invoices assigned 
if a customer failed to pay cit by the due date  the company was charged interest at prime plus  which was at april   until payment was received 
the company incurred interest expense of  and  in the years ended april  and april   respectively  as a result of the failure of the company s customers to pay cit by the due date 
cit bears credit losses with respect to assigned accounts receivable from approved shipments  while the company bears the responsibility for adjustments from customers related to returns  allowances  claims and discounts 
cit may at any time terminate or limit its approval of shipments to a particular customer 
if such a termination or limitation were to occur  the company would either assume the credit risks for shipments to the customer after the date of such termination or limitation or cease shipments to the customer 
factoring fees  which are included in marketing and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income  were  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
there were no advances from the factor at either april  or april  critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb  as well as the securities act  the exchange act and the rules and regulations thereunder as administered by the sec 
references herein to gaap are to topics within the fasb accounting standards codification the fasb asc  which the fasb periodically revises through the issuance of an accounting standards update asu and which has been established by the fasb as the authoritative source for gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the listing below  while not inclusive of all of the company s accounting policies  sets forth those accounting policies which the company s management believes embody the most significant judgments due to the uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
inventory valuation the preparation of the company s financial statements requires careful determination of the appropriate dollar amount of the company s inventory balances 
such amount is presented as a current asset in the company s consolidated balance sheets and is a direct determinant of cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income and  therefore  has a significant impact on the amount of net income reported in the accounting periods 
the basis of accounting for inventories is cost  which is the sum of expenditures and charges  both direct and indirect  incurred to acquire inventory  bring it to a condition suitable for sale  and store it until it is sold 
once cost has been determined  the company s inventory is then stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method  which assumes that inventory quantities are sold in the order in which they are acquired 
the determination of the indirect charges and their allocation to the company s finished goods inventories is complex and requires significant management judgment and estimates 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  then differences would result in the valuation of the company s inventories and in the amount and timing of the company s cost of goods sold and resulting net income for the reporting period 
on a periodic basis  management reviews its inventory quantities on hand for obsolescence  physical deterioration  changes in price levels and the existence of quantities on hand which may not reasonably be expected to be sold within the company s normal operating cycle 
to the extent that any of these conditions is believed to exist or the market value of the inventory expected to be realized in the ordinary course of business is otherwise no longer as great as its carrying value  an allowance against the inventory value is established 
to the extent that this allowance is established or increased during an accounting period  an expense is recorded in cost of goods sold in the company s consolidated statements of income 
only when inventory for which an allowance has been established is later sold or is otherwise disposed is the allowance reduced accordingly 
significant management judgment is required in determining the amount and adequacy of this allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from management s estimates or these estimates and judgments are revised in future periods  the company may not fully realize the carrying value of its inventory or may need to establish additional allowances  either of which could materially impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
the company classifies a negative balance outstanding under its revolving line of credit as cash  as these amounts are legally owed to the company and are immediately available to be drawn upon by the company 
revenue recognition sales are recorded when goods are shipped to customers and are reported net of allowances for estimated returns and allowances in the consolidated statements of income 
allowances for returns are estimated based on historical rates 
allowances for returns  advertising allowances  warehouse allowances and volume rebates are recorded commensurate with sales activity and the cost of such allowances is netted against sales in reporting the results of operations 
shipping and handling costs  net of amounts reimbursed by customers  are not material and are included in net sales 
allowances against accounts receivable the company s allowances against accounts receivable are primarily contractually agreed upon deductions for items such as advertising and warehouse allowances and volume rebates 
these deductions are recorded throughout the year commensurate with sales activity 
funding of the majority of the company s allowances occurs on a per invoice basis 
the allowances for customer deductions  which are netted against accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets  consist of agreed upon advertising support  markdowns and warehouse and other allowances 
all such allowances are recorded as direct offsets to sales  and such costs are accrued commensurate with sales activities 
when a customer requests deductions  the allowances are reduced to reflect such payments or credits issued against the customer s account balance 
the company analyzes the components of the allowances for customer deductions monthly and adjusts the allowances to the appropriate levels 
the timing of the customer initiated funding requests for advertising support can cause the net balance in the allowance account to fluctuate from period to period 
the timing of such funding requests should have a minimal impact on the consolidated statements of income since such costs are accrued commensurate with sales activity 
to reduce its exposure to credit losses  the company assigns the majority of its receivables under factoring agreements with cit 
in the event a factored receivable becomes uncollectible due to creditworthiness  cit bears the risk of loss 
the company s management must make estimates of the uncollectiblity of its non factored accounts receivable when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts  which it accomplishes by specifically analyzing accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customers payment terms 
the company s accounts receivable at april  amounted to million  net of allowances of million 
of this amount  million was due from cit under the factoring agreements  and  was due from cit as a negative balance outstanding under the company s revolving line of credit  which combined amounts represent the maximum loss that the company could incur if cit failed completely to perform its obligations under the factoring agreements and the revolving line of credit 
royalty payments the company has entered into agreements that provide for royalty payments based on a percentage of sales with certain minimum guaranteed amounts 
these royalty amounts are accrued based upon historical sales rates adjusted for current sales trends by customers 
royalty expense is included in cost of sales and amounted to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
provision for income taxes the company s provision for income taxes includes all currently payable federal  state  local and foreign taxes that are based on the company s taxable income and the change during the fiscal year in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
the company provides for deferred income taxes based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the company s policy is to recognize the effect that a change in enacted tax rates would have on net deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period that the tax rates are changed 
the company s provision for income taxes on continuing operations is based on effective tax rates of and in fiscal years and  respectively 
these effective tax rates are the sum of the top us statutory federal income tax rate and a composite rate for state income taxes  net of federal tax benefit  in the various states in which the company operates 
management evaluates items of income  deductions and credits reported on the company s various federal and state income tax returns filed and recognizes the effect of positions taken on those income tax returns only if those positions are more likely than not to be sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
based on its recent evaluation  the company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the company s consolidated financial statements 
tax years still open to federal or state general examination or other adjustment as of april  were the tax years ended march   march   april  and april   as well as the tax year ended march  for several states 
the company s policy is to accrue interest expense and penalties as appropriate on any estimated unrecognized tax benefits as a charge to interest expense in the company s consolidated statements of income 
depreciation and amortization the company s consolidated balance sheets reflect property  plant and equipment  and certain intangible assets at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
the company capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses maintenance and repairs as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which are three to eight years for property  plant and equipment  and one to sixteen years for intangible assets other than goodwill 
the company amortizes improvements to its leased facilities over the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset  whichever is shorter 
valuation of long lived assets  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill in addition to the depreciation and amortization procedures set forth above  the company reviews for impairment long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any asset may not be recoverable 
in the event of impairment  the asset is written down to its fair market value 
assets to be disposed of  if any  are recorded at the lower of net book value or fair market value  less estimated costs to sell at the date management commits to a plan of disposal  and are classified as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company tests the carrying value of its goodwill annually on the first day of the company s fiscal year 
an additional impairment test is performed during the year whenever an event or change in circumstances suggest that the fair value of the goodwill of either of the reporting units of the company has more likely than not fallen below its carrying value 
recently issued accounting standards on may   the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this asu is intended to improve consistency across jurisdictions to ensure that us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrss fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are described in the same way 
for public entities  the amendments in this asu are to be applied prospectively effective for annual periods beginning after december   and early application is not permitted 
the company does not anticipate that its adoption of asu no 
on april  will impact its consolidated financial statements 
on september   the fasb issued fasb asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this asu will give an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not defined as having a likelihood of greater than that the fair value of the goodwill of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step impairment test 
the asu is intended to reduce the cost and complexity associated with the test for goodwill impairment 
the amendments in this asu are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   and early application is permitted 
because the annual impairment test of the fair value of the goodwill of the company s reporting units was performed as of april   the company adopted asu no 
on april  the company does not anticipate that such adoption will impact its consolidated financial statements
