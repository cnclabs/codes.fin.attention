item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statement this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private litigation reform act of some of the forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking words such as believes  expects  may  will  should  seeks  approximately  intends  plans  estimates  projects  strategy  or anticipates  or the negative of those words or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements  including those factors described in risk factors under item a in this form k 
some factors include changes in governmental  legislative and environmental restrictions  catastrophic losses from fires  floods  windstorms  earthquakes  volcanic eruptions  insect infestations or diseases  as well as changes in economic conditions and competition in our domestic and export markets and other factors described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contemplated by our projected  forecasted  estimated or budgeted results as reflected in forward looking statements relating to our operations and business include  but are not limited to the failure to meet our expectations with respect to our likely future performance  an unanticipated reduction in the demand for timber products and or an unanticipated increase in supply of timber products  an unanticipated reduction in demand for higher and better use or non strategic timberlands  our failure to make strategic acquisitions or to integrate any such acquisitions effectively or  conversely  our failure to make strategic divestitures  and our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust  or reit

table of contents part ii item overview operating performance compared to our operating income for of million was million lower than our operating income for our operations continue to be negatively impacted by near record low housing starts  which are a result of high unemployment  declining home values  an excess supply of homes for sale and the difficulties associated with obtaining financing for home and or real estate purchases 
we expect many of these adverse trends will continue to negatively impact our operating results in operating income in our northern resources segment increased by million from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to higher sawlog prices and harvest levels in oregon as a result of an improved demand from china for export logs 
operating income in our southern resources segment decreased by million from million in to million in this decrease was due primarily to lower sawlog and pulpwood prices 
both sawlog and pulpwood prices declined because of the abundant supply of logs due primarily to favorable harvesting conditions 
sawlog prices were also negatively impacted by near record low housing starts 
operating income in our manufacturing products segment decreased by million from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to the rising of cost of raw materials used to manufacture our plywood and mdf products 
operating income in our real estate segment increased by million from million in to million in despite selling fewer acres and recognizing lower revenues in  our operating income increased due primarily to selling more properties in that had a lower book basis 
liquidity we ended with a strong balance sheet and we do not foresee any liquidity issues in at december   we had a cash balance of million and availability on our line of credit of million 
during  we generated million of cash from operating activities 
despite anticipated improved cash flow as a result of higher sawlog harvest volumes and prices  we expect cash provided by operating activities in to decline due to using million of cash for the purchase of an eight year timber deed 
we expect our cash balance to improve approximately million during due to anticipated higher sawlog volumes and prices  and also due to financing the purchase of the timber deed 
as a result  we expect more than adequate cash to fund our current dividend approximately million and planned capital expenditures approximately million 
we have scheduled debt principal payments of million in and million in january  which we expect to refinance at favorable interest rates 
key economic factors impacting our resources and manufactured products business our operating performance for the resources and manufactured products segments is impacted primarily by the supply and demand for logs and wood products in the united states 
the short term supply of logs is impacted primarily by weather and the level of harvesting activities 
the demand for logs and wood products in the united states is impacted by housing starts  repair and remodeling activities  industrial activity and the amount of imported lumber  primarily from canada 
selected us housing economic data for the last five years was as follows at december us housing starts in millions supply of existing homes for sale in months yr 
fixed interest mortgage rates average the housing market in remained depressed again for the fourth consecutive year 
despite record low interest rates and pent up demand for housing  the us housing market experienced no improvement during housing plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item starts continue to be negatively impacted by high unemployment  declining home values  an excess supply of homes for sale  and strict lending standards 
housing starts in increased by over the prior year due to a increase in multi family starts 
however  single family starts declined by to approximately  starts in  which was the lowest number of single family starts in the past years 
with a single family unit using approximately twice as much wood as a multi family unit  the demand for wood products continued to decline in housing starts are not expected to significantly improve until the employment outlook improves and home prices stabilize 
unlike prior recoveries from recession  the unemployment rate continues to remain high and at the end of january  was 
although the unemployment rate is slowly declining  at the current rate of job creation it is expected to take another several years before the us returns to full employment 
home values nationally continued falling in  declining an additional 
currently  there exists an estimated six million homes that either have been foreclosed or are in the process of foreclosure  that are behind on their mortgage payments  or that owe more on their loan than the value of their home 
as a result  home prices may continue to decline in while we believe favorable demographics will bode well for the wood products business in the long run and that annual housing starts will return to more normal levels ie between million and million annual starts  for the last several years  low housing starts have significantly reduced lumber demand and  therefore  log demand 
this has resulted in weak pricing for the logs and wood products we sell 
we expect the prices for our logs and wood products to remain weak until there is a significant improvement in the number of us housing starts  reduced levels of unemployment and a decline in the number of homes for sale 
we use independent third party contract loggers and haulers to deliver our logs to our customers 
as weak business conditions in the timber business have persisted for several years  there are fewer loggers and haulers available in certain markets to produce logs 
while we continue to enhance strong working relationships with our loggers and haulers  when log markets improve there may be production and delivery constraints that could impact log prices and  potentially  our ability to benefit from these conditions by delivering logs 
over the past several years  fuel prices have fluctuated significantly 
our timber and manufacturing operations are significantly impacted by changing fuel prices 
the table below summarizes the average annual us on highway diesel fuel prices and the impact of fluctuating fuel prices on our operating income compared to the prior annual period increase decrease operating income in millions n a annual average us on highway diesel price per gallon higher value and non strategic timberlands from time to time  we review our timberlands to identify properties that may have higher values other than as commercial timberlands see discussion in item real estate segment 
we estimate that included in the company s million acres of timberlands at december   are approximately  acres of higher value timberlands which are expected to be sold  exchanged  and or developed over the next years for recreational  conservation or residential purposes 
included within the  acres of higher value timberlands are approximately  acres we expect to sell for recreational uses  approximately  acres we expect to sell for conservation and approximately  acres that are identified as having development potential 
furthermore  the company has approximately  acres of non strategic timberlands  which are expected to be sold over the near and medium term in smaller scale transactions small non strategic 
not included in the above  higher value acres and  small non strategic acres are other acres that are expected to be sold in large acreage transactions to commercial timberland buyers as opportunities arise large non strategic 
some of our real estate activities  including our real estate development business  are conducted through our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries 
in the meantime  all of our timberlands continue to be managed productively in our business of growing and selling timber 
during  we sold approximately  acres of higher and better use recreational properties for proceeds of million  approximately  acres of conservation properties for proceeds of million  approximately  acres of small non strategic properties for proceeds of million  along with approximately  acres of large plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item non strategic properties for proceeds of million 
we expect revenue from real estate sales during to range between million and million 
we expect an increased proportion of our revenue for real estate sales to come from the sale of large non strategic properties 
our land development business slowed dramatically starting in and has since remained weak 
we do not expect any significant proceeds from the sale of real estate development properties in we expect our real estate development business to remain weak until there is a significant improvement in consumer confidence  real estate values begin appreciating and financing becomes available for such properties 
harvest levels the volume of trees we harvest each year and the percentage of sawlogs and pulpwood product mix included in our annual harvest also impact our operating performance 
during  we harvested a total of million tons compared to a total of million tons during we expect total harvest levels to increase approximately as a result of the recent purchase of an eight year timber deed and increasing our sawlog harvest 
while we have the flexibility to modify our annual harvest volumes  based on market conditions  we expect harvest levels to increase approximately over the near term next five years and more than over the long term ten years and beyond compared to harvest levels 
future harvest levels may vary from historic or expected levels due to weaker or stronger than anticipated markets or other factors outside of our control  such as weather and fires 
future harvest levels may also be impacted by the acquisition of timberlands or the disposition of timberlands beyond the million acres described above in the higher value and non strategic timberlands section 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition for timber sales timber sales revenues are recognized when legal ownership and the risk of loss transfer to the purchaser and the quantity sold is determinable 
we sell timber under delivered log agreements and through sales of standing timber or stumpage using pay as cut sales contracts or timber deed sale agreements 
delivered log sales 
under a delivered log sale agreement  we harvest the timber and deliver it to the buyer 
revenue is recognized when the log is delivered as risk of loss and title transfer to the buyer 
with delivered log sales  we incur the cost of logging and hauling 
pay as cut sales contracts 
pay as cut sales contracts are agreements in which the buyer agrees to purchase and harvest specified timber on a tract of land for an agreed upon price for each type of tree over the term of the contract usually to months 
in some cases  an advance is received in connection with pay as cut sales contracts 
in other cases  the buyer agrees to harvest only certain trees on a tract of land 
under pay as cut sales contracts  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
revenue is recognized when the timber is harvested  as title and risk of loss has transferred to the buyer 
total revenue recognized under a pay as cut sales contract is the total volume of wood removed multiplied by the unit price for each type of tree 
timber deeds 
timber deed sales are agreements in which the buyer agrees to purchase and harvest specified timber ie mature pulpwood and or sawlogs on a tract of land over the term of the contract usually less than months 
unlike a pay as cut sales contract  risk of loss and title to the trees transfer to the buyer when the contract is signed 
the buyer pays the full purchase price when the contract is signed and we do not have any additional performance plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item obligations 
under a timber deed  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs and the timing of such activity 
revenue from a timber deed sale is recognized when the contract is signed because the earnings process is complete 
timber deeds are generally marketed and sold to the highest bidder 
bids are typically based on a timber cruise which is an estimate of the total volume of timber on a tract of land broken down by the various types of trees such as softwood sawlogs  hardwood pulpwood  etc total revenue recognized under a timber deed is not dependent upon the volume or types of trees actually harvested 
the following table summarizes amounts recognized under each method from sales to external customers in the company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended december in millions revenues from delivered log sales pay as cut sales timber deed sales substantially all of our timber sales in the northern resources segment are under delivered log sale agreements 
in our southern resources segment  approximately of our timber sales in and of our timber sales consisted of pay as cut sales contracts or timber deed sales 
under sales of stumpage  the buyer is responsible for the logging and hauling costs  therefore  the operating profit as a percentage of revenue is typically higher in our southern resources segment 
real estate sales the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors  including the general state of the economy  demand in local real estate markets  the ability to obtain entitlements  the ability of buyers to obtain financing  the number of competing properties listed for sale  the seasonal nature of sales particularly in the northern states  the plans of adjacent landowners  our expectation of future price appreciation  the timing of harvesting activities  and the availability of government and not for profit funding especially for conservation sales 
as a result  the timing of our real estate sales may materially impact our reported operating income and net income 
during  the real estate segment reported an operating profit percentage of approximately 
over the last ten years  the real estate segment s annual operating profit percentage has ranged from to of revenues 
the operating profit percentage depends on the nature of the interest sold and how much the market value of the property has risen over its book value 
for example  sales of properties that have been held by the company for a long time ie decades will tend to have relatively higher operating profit percentages than properties that have been held by the company for shorter time periods 
in contrast  the sale of conservation easements will generally have an operating profit percentage of close to because historically no book basis was allocated to these types of sales 
in general  timberlands are acquired primarily for long term use in our timber operations 
in connection with timberland acquisitions  we are generally not able to identify  with any level of precision  our future real estate sales ie specific properties with a higher value than for use in timber production 
however  our purchase price allocation and related appraisals for these acquisitions may reflect greater values for real estate which may be sold in the future but are not yet specifically identified 
therefore  in connection with our purchase price allocation for timberland acquisitions  the greater values for real estate are allocated proportionately among all of the acres acquired 
specific properties cannot be identified in advance because their value is dependent upon numerous factors  most of which are not known at the acquisition date  including current and future zoning restrictions  current and future environmental restrictions  future changes in demographics  future changes in the economy  current and future plans of adjacent landowners  and current and future funding of government and not for profit conservation and recreation programs 
we believe that current and future results of operations could be materially different under different purchase price allocation assumptions 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our ability to recover the net investment in long lived assets when required by the accounting standards 
we recognize an impairment loss in connection with long lived assets used in our business when the carrying value plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item net book value of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to those assets over their expected useful life 
impairment losses are measured by the extent to which the carrying value of a group of assets exceeds the fair value of such assets at a given point in time 
generally  our fair value measurements used in calculating an impairment loss are categorized as level measurements ie unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity under the fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards codification 
typically  we will use a discounted cash flow model or an external appraisal to estimate the fair value of the affected assets 
furthermore  we recognize an impairment loss in connection with long lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of the assets exceeds an amount equal to their fair value less selling costs 
the company has had a long history of acquiring timberlands 
management is required to estimate the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date 
subsequent to the original allocation  assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations 
our long lived assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are independent cash flows 
we track cash flows for our million acres of timberlands by grouping them into seven geographic areas in the northern resources segment and five geographic areas in the southern resources segment 
additionally  we track cash flows for each of our manufacturing facilities 
timber and timberlands used in our business 
for assets used in our business  an impairment loss is recorded only when the carrying value of those assets is not recoverable through future operations 
the recoverability test is based on undiscounted future cash flows over the expected life of the assets 
we use one harvest cycle which ranges between and years for evaluating the recoverability of our timber and timberlands 
because of the inherently long life of timber and timberlands  we do not expect to incur an impairment loss in the future for the timber and timberlands used in our timber business 
timber and timberlands held for sale 
an impairment loss is recognized for long lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of those assets exceeds an amount equal to its fair value less selling costs 
an asset is generally considered to be held for sale when we have committed to a plan to sell the asset  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition  we have initiated an active program to locate a buyer eg  listed with a broker  and the sale is expected to close within one year 
during the last several years  the above criteria have been met by some of our timberland properties  and we have recognized annual impairment losses of between million and million for certain of these properties see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
an impairment loss is generally not recorded until management expects that timberlands will be sold within the next months 
for many properties that are currently listed for sale  it is difficult to conclude whether they will be sold within one year and to estimate the price 
nevertheless  management performs a probability assessment for all properties that are listed for sale and records an impairment loss to the extent the property s book basis exceeds its estimated fair value net of selling cost in the quarter in which management expects the property will be sold within twelve months 
we expect to continue to sell or exchange timberlands to other forest products companies or non industrial buyers  and it is probable that we will recognize additional impairment losses  some of which could be material  in the future in connection with sales of timberlands 
property  plant and equipment 
the carrying value of property  plant and equipment represents primarily the net book value of our eight two of which are curtailed until markets improve manufacturing facilities 
each manufacturing facility is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable through future operations 
the estimated future cash flows over the remaining useful life of a manufacturing facility is highly subjective and is dependent upon estimates for future product pricing  raw material costs and availability  volumes of product sold  and residual value of the facility 
no impairment losses were recorded during or during  as a result of an analysis to rationalize and consolidate its lumber operations  the company recorded an impairment charge of million related to certain lumber manufacturing assets 
we currently estimate that the carrying value for our eight facilities is recoverable through future operations and that our estimate of future cash flows is reasonable 
however  if wood product prices were to remain weak at current levels for an extended period of time  or if log or raw material availability declines  we may record an impairment loss for one or more of our manufacturing facilities in a future period 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item capitalized real estate development costs 
current and future costs associated with specific real estate development projects are capitalized once management has concluded it is probable that a project will be successful 
real estate development costs are expensed as incurred when management is not able to conclude that it is probable a project will be successful 
furthermore  previously capitalized costs for specific projects are written off when management revises its prior assessment and concludes that it is probable a project will not be successful and costs will not be recovered 
for many of our projects  there is less judgment in making this determination due to prior experience in the local market or advice from consultants 
however  for some of our larger projects where we have limited experience in the local market or for projects in environmentally sensitive areas  there is significant judgment in assessing the expected outcome for the projects 
at december   we have million of capitalized costs associated with projects that management expects will be successful 
of these capitalized costs  approximately million represent costs for a single project that has been approved by a state commission but is being appealed in court by groups opposed to the project 
while not expected  if the approval is reversed  some or all of these capitalized costs could be written off in the next twelve months 
depletion depletion  or costs attributed to timber harvested  is recorded as trees are harvested 
depletion rates for each geographic area are adjusted at least annually 
depletion rates are computed by dividing a the sum of the original cost of the timber less previously recorded depletion plus estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation  that are expected to be incurred over the next harvest cycle  by b the total timber volume that is estimated to be harvested over the harvest cycle 
the harvest cycle can be as short as years in the south to as long as years in the north 
the estimate of future silviculture costs is limited to the expenditures that are expected to impact growth rates over the harvest cycle 
the depletion rate calculations do not include an estimate for either future reforestation costs associated with a stand s final harvest or future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item the following table summarizes depletion expense recognized in the company s financial statements  key assumptions and sensitivities to changes in assumptions for the years ended december dollars in millions  except per ton amounts depletion expense northern resources segment southern resources segment total depletion expense average depletion rates per ton northern resources segment southern resources segment assumptions used to determine the average depletion rates estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation northern resources segment southern resources segment a estimated future volume in million tons northern resources segment southern resources segment b sensitivity of results to changes in key assumptions increase in depletion expense for a increase in estimated future silviculture costs c northern resources segment southern resources segment decrease in estimated future volume d northern resources segment southern resources segment a reflects an increase in our estimates of future costs associated with fertilization treatments due to higher chemical and application costs and more acres treated 
b increase from is due primarily to an increase in our estimate of rotation length for certain stands and improved growth rates 
c assumes future timber volumes do not change 
d assumes future silviculture costs do not change 
significant estimates and judgments are required to determine both future silviculture costs and the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle 
some of the factors impacting the estimates are changes in inflation rates  the cost of fertilizers and chemicals  the cost of capital  the actual and estimated increase in growth rates from fertilizer applications  the relative price of sawlogs and pulpwood  the actual and expected real price appreciation of timber  the scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology  and changes in harvest cycles 
we have invested in technology that enables us to predict our current standing inventory of trees  future growth rates  and the benefits of scientific advancements in connection with seedlings  planting techniques and fertilizer applications 
therefore  while estimates with respect to depletion computations will be revised at least annually  we do not expect the depletion rates will change materially from year to year 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item depletion expense in in january  we purchased standing timber under an eight year timber deed for approximately million with initial volume of approximately million tons 
the timber deed will have its own unique depletion rate 
we expect depletion expense in our southern resources segment to increase by approximately million as a result of harvesting a portion of the timber deed s standing timber in accounting for share based compensation plum creek has a stockholder approved stock incentive plan that provides for the award of non qualified stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  value management awards and dividend equivalents 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
grants of value management awards are classified and accounted for as liabilities 
as a result  the expense recognized over the performance period will equal the fair value ie  cash value of an award as of the last day of the performance period multiplied by the number of awards that are earned 
furthermore  the quarterly expense recognized during the performance period is based on the fair value as of the end of the most recent quarter 
prior to the end of the performance period  compensation cost for value management awards is based on the awards most recent quarterly fair values and the number of months of service rendered during the performance period 
fair values for value management awards are computed based on our historical relative total shareholder return and simulated relative total shareholder return compared to the performance of peer groups consisting of forest products companies  the s p index and the morgan stanley reit index over the same period peer group 
the simulated total shareholder return of the company and the peer group is computed using a monte carlo simulation 
the key assumptions used in the simulation of the company s and the peer group s total shareholder return are volatility  beta the measure of how plum creek s stock moves relative to the market as a whole and risk free interest rate 
the fair value of the liability for outstanding value management awards at december  was million  which is based on the current fair value of outstanding awards multiplied by the percentage of months that services were provided during the performance period 
the liability at december  could range between and million based on the possible fair value of all outstanding liability based awards 
we could have a material adjustment to our share based compensation liability to the extent there is a material change in the fair value of our value management awards during the quarter 
pensions pension plans overview 
plum creek provides pension benefits under defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan and two supplemental non qualified defined benefit pension plans 
participants benefits vest after three years of service 
the cash balance benefits for salaried employees is determined based primarily on certain percentages of compensation  age  years of service and interest accrued based on the year treasury bond rate 
participants who were employees of the company on september   earn benefits based on the greater of the cash balance benefits or a monthly pension benefit that is principally based on the highest monthly average earnings during any consecutive sixty month out of the last month period and the number of years of service credit 
the benefits to hourly employees are generally based on a fixed amount per year of service 
plum creek s contributions to its qualified pension plan vary from year to year  but the company has made at least the minimum contributions required by law in each year 
it is generally the company s policy to fund the qualified pension plan annually such that the fair value of plan assets equals or exceeds the actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation the approximate actuarially computed current pension obligation if the plan was discontinued over a market cycle generally to years 
the company has the same funding policy for the non qualified plan 
however  assets related to the non qualified plans are held in a grantor trust and are subject to the claims of creditors and  therefore  are not considered plan assets 
under current us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  the company makes estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
these assumptions and their sensitivities  along with the application of the accounting principles and impact to our financial statements  are discussed in the next several sections 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item current year impact and analysis 
during  our pension liability increased from million to million and our pension assets decreased from million to million 
our pension liability represents the present value of expected future benefit payments and is remeasured annually as of december each year  our pension liability increases due to employees working for one more year service cost  and getting one year closer to receiving benefit payments interest cost  and decreases as pension benefits are paid 
our pension liability is also adjusted due to changes in interest rates 
during  our pension liability increased by million an actuarial loss due to falling interest rates 
actuarial losses are initially recognized in other comprehensive income loss and then subsequently amortized charged to pension expense over future periods 
annually  our plan assets increase due to cash contributions from the company  decrease due to pension benefit payments  and will increase or decrease as a result of realized and unrealized gains and losses for the assets 
our pension expense is reduced by the expected returns on plan assets 
we currently estimate that our long term return on plan assets will average per year 
based on the plan assets balance  our pension expense was reduced by million the expected return on plan assets in dollars 
the actual return on plan assets was a loss of million for we initially recognize this difference shortfall of million in other comprehensive income loss and then subsequently will amortize charge to pension expense over future periods 
at december   our cumulative net actuarial pension loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss was million includes both unrecognized changes in our pension liability and plan assets  of which million will be amortized charged to pension expense 
each year the future amortization of our actuarial pension loss recognized in pension expense will increase or decrease due to changes in interest rates and actual returns on plan assets compared to expected returns 
additionally  while not expected  future company contributions may need to be increased to the extent interest rates remain low or actual investment returns on plan assets do not meet our expectations 
significant assumptions 
the computation of the company s benefit obligation  pension cost and accrued pension liability under us gaap requires us to make certain assumptions involving primarily the following weighted average rates assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation at december discount rates a annuity distributions lump sum distributions rate of compensation increase b assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate annuity distributions lump sum distributions expected long term return on plan assets c rate of compensation increase b a the december  discount rate for annuity distributions was determined by the resulting yield of a hypothetical bond portfolio at december   matched to the expected benefit payments under the plans 
bonds selected for this portfolio had a moody s or standard poor s credit rating of aa or better as of december  the december  discount rate for lump sum distributions is based on yields on year us treasury bonds 
b the assumed rate of increase of future compensation levels represents our long term estimate of such increases on the basis of the composition of plan participants  past results and market expectations 
c the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds  the historical level of the risk premium associated with plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns on each asset class 
the expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the portfolio 
since pension benefits may be settled in either a single lump sum or an annuity distribution  both the estimated percentage of participants electing a lump sum payment and the assumed interest rate discount rate used in computing the lump sum benefit are key assumptions 
we currently estimate that approximately half of the qualified plan participants will elect a lump sum distribution upon termination 
other key assumptions used in the estimate include primarily those underlying the mortality table  and expected long term rates for inflation  retirement and withdrawals  all of which are based on plan experience and standard actuarial methods but which are nevertheless subject to uncertainty 
it is likely that the actual return on plan assets and the outcome of other uncertain variables will differ from those used in estimating our pension costs and pension obligation 
furthermore  the company may  from time to time  adjust the asset allocation  which may have an impact on the long term rate of return on plan assets

we have not included in the table above our purchase of a timber deed 
in december  we signed an agreement to acquire a timber deed in the southern resources segment for million 
concurrent with the execution of this agreement  we paid a million deposit 
in january  we completed this acquisition and paid the remaining purchase price of million 
the timber deed encompasses approximately million tons of standing timber and will be harvested over the eight year term of the deed 
events and trends affecting operating results harvest plans we determine our annual timber sawlogs and pulpwood  including stumpage sales harvesting plans based on a number of factors 
at the stand level  ranging in size from to acres  we consider the age  size  density  health and economic maturity of the timber 
a stand is a contiguous block of trees of a similar age  species mix or silvicultural regime 
at the forest level  ranging in size from  to almost million acres  we consider the long term sustainability and environmental impact of certain levels of harvesting  certain external conditions such as supply agreements  and the level of demand for wood within the region 
a forest is a broad administrative unit  made up of a large number of stands 
harvest scheduling is the technical approach using computer modeling that considers all of the above factors along with forest growth rates and financial assumptions to project future harvest plans for a number of years forward 
our actual harvest levels may vary from planned levels due to log demand  sales prices  the availability of timber from other sources  the level of timberland sales and acquisitions  the availability of legal access  abnormal weather conditions  fires and other factors outside of our control 
we believe that our harvest plans are sufficiently flexible to permit modification in response to short term fluctuations in the markets for logs 
furthermore  future harvest levels will be impacted by sales and purchases of timberlands 
the impact will depend on the level and extent we are able to reinvest proceeds in productive timberlands and the stocking levels and age class distribution of any newly acquired timberlands 
harvest levels are also impacted by the purchase of a long term timber deed 
in january  the company acquired approximately million tons of standing timber in our southern resources segment for a total purchase price of million 
we expect to harvest the million tons plus the related growth over the eight year term of the timber deed 
northern resources segment 
harvest levels were million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during and million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during in  we expect sawlog harvest volumes to increase by approximately due to favorable export markets  and we expect pulpwood harvest volumes in to be comparable to harvest volumes 
while the company has flexibility to modify our annual harvest volumes  based on market conditions  we expect harvest levels beyond in both the near term and long term to increase by more than and we expect the product mix ie  the percentage of sawlogs vs 
pulpwood to improve to greater than sawlogs compared to harvest levels 
southern resources segment 
harvest levels were million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during and million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during in  we expect sawlog harvest volumes to increase by approximately as a result of the recent purchase of an eight year timber deed and harvesting volume that was previously deferred 
we expect pulpwood harvest volumes in to be comparable to harvest volumes 
while the company has flexibility to modify our annual harvest volumes  based on market conditions  we expect harvest levels beyond to be at moderately higher levels over the near term next five years and increase more than over the long term ten years and beyond and we expect the product mix to improve to approximately sawlogs compared to harvest levels

table of contents part ii item manufactured products segment production levels the results of our manufactured products segment are driven largely by the strength of the us housing market  which began declining in and has remained very weak 
in  housing starts increased from levels to approximately  starts  but they remain significantly below historical averages achieved in the previous decade of approximately million starts per year 
during  we permanently closed two lumber mills  suspended production at one additional lumber mill and one remanufacturing facility and reduced production at another lumber mill 
we have also reduced production at our mdf and plywood facilities in response to the decline in demand 
during  we continued to operate all of our manufactured products facilities at reduced or suspended levels similar to until markets for wood products improve  our expected production levels and sales volumes will be significantly lower than the combined capacity of our facilities 
clean water act ninth circuit ruling in august   a three judge panel of the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit ruled in northwest environmental defense center nedc v 
brown that ditches and culverts associated with forest roads were point sources under the clean water act cwa and thus required national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permits should storm water runoff that is channeled and or conveyed from such sources be discharged into waters of the united states 
in may   the court denied a petition for rehearing  leaving its prior decision in place 
the plaintiff alleged that the defendants violated the cwa by not obtaining epa permits for stormwater runoff from logging roads into systems of ditches  culverts and channels that is then discharged into forest streams and rivers 
the plaintiff further alleged that timber hauling on logging roads is a major source of sediment that flows through the stormwater collection system 
this decision overturns a long standing epa rule that had exempted such sources of runoff from cwa permitting 
since  the epa has promulgated and amended a regulation specifically exempting from npdes permitting requirements point source silviculture activities such as nursery operations  site preparation  reforestation and subsequent silvicultural treatment  thinning  prescribed burning  pest and fire control  harvesting operations  surface drainage  or road construction and maintenance from which there is natural runoff the silviculture rule 
under the silviculture rule  the epa did not require permitting for discharges from ditches  culverts and channels that collect stormwater runoff from logging roads 
instead  these forestry sources of stormwater runoff are regulated by the states  many of which do so by adopting best management practices 
the outcome of the court s decision is uncertain 
a petition for review has been filed with the united states supreme court seeking to appeal the decision 
after reviewing  the supreme court has requested the us solicitor general seek out and report to the court the views of several relevant federal agencies  including the epa  the us department of agriculture  the department of interior and the council on environmental quality 
it is expected that the supreme court will decide whether to hear the appeal shortly after receiving this report 
in addition  legislation passed by congress in late december prohibits the epa from implementing the npdes permitting regime mandated by the ninth circuit decision through september  should the ninth circuit s ruling stand  its impact on the company and the timber industry is unknown 
it is unclear whether the epa would require npdes permits for forest roads outside of the area covered by the ninth circuit 
it is also unclear what  if any  additional regulatory restrictions would be imposed by the npdes permitting process 
further  if logging and other forest management roads and operations currently within the scope of the silviculture rule were placed within the npdes permitting regime  it is possible that cwa total maximum daily load tmdl allocations in various stream drainages  anti degradation  and other npdes requirements could be affected 
a significant increase in operational and compliance costs for landowners and operators is possible depending upon the regulatory response to the court s decision 
comparability of financial statement periods acquisitions and divestitures

conservation sales vary significantly from period to period and are primarily impacted by government and not for profit funding  the limited number of conservation buyers  and the timing of our transactions 
additionally  the price per acre for conservation properties can vary significantly due to the geographic location and the rationale for the conservation designation 
the decrease in small non strategic acres sold during compared to was due primarily to an unusually large sale during the first quarter of when a collection of approximately  acres were sold to a single buyer 
revenues from our higher and better use recreational land sales decreased due primarily to selling approximately  or fewer acres and to a lesser extent from a lower average price per acre compared to sales in demand for higher and better use recreational properties especially our higher value properties remains weak due to concerns over near term real estate values  low consumer confidence  and the inability of buyers to secure debt financing
