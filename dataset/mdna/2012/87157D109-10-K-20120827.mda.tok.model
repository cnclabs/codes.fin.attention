table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and factors that may affect results you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a 
risk factors 
overview we are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom designed human interface solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing  communications  entertainment  and other electronic devices 
we believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus  the strength of our intellectual property  and our engineering know how  which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of oems 
we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or title has transferred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
our net revenue increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
for fiscal  we derived of our net revenue from the personal computer market and of our net revenue from the digital lifestyle product markets 
for fiscal  revenue from the personal computer market accounted for of our net revenue and revenue from the digital lifestyle product markets accounted for of our net revenue 
many of our customers have migrated their manufacturing operations from taiwan to china  and many of our oem customers have established design centers in that region 
with our expanded global presence  including offices in china  finland  hong kong  japan  korea  switzerland  taiwan  and the united states  we are well positioned to provide local sales  operational  and engineering support services to our existing customers  as well as potential new customers  on a global basis 
our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers facilities  eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories 
this approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements 
we provide our contract manufacturers with six month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next days 
however  we do not have any long term supply contracts with any of our contract manufacturers 
we use two third party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and one third party packaging manufacturer to package our proprietary asics 
in certain cases  we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products 
our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products  including materials  logistics  manufacturing  assembly  and test costs paid to third party manufacturers and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel 
additionally  we charge all warranty costs  yield losses  and any inventory provisions or write downs to cost of revenue 
our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our oem customers products in meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost improvement programs 
these cost improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements 
our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products  which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost improvement programs 
as a result  new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin 
our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development  as well as the engineering costs incurred to design human interface solutions for oem customers prior to and after their commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products 
these expenses have generally increased  reflecting our continuing commitment to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets 

table of contents selling  general  and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  internal sales and outside sales representatives commissions  market and usability research  outside legal  accounting  and consulting costs  and other marketing and sales activities 
these expenses have generally increased  primarily reflecting incremental staffing and related support costs associated with our increased business levels  growth in our existing markets  and penetration into new markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  cost of revenue  inventories  product warranty  share based compensation costs  provision for income taxes  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances  uncertain tax positions  tax contingencies  goodwill  intangible assets  investments  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  applicable laws and regulations  and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the methods  estimates  interpretations  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the sec considers an entity s most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of the entity s financial condition and results of operations and those that require the entity s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or title has transferred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured  which is generally upon shipment 
we accrue for estimated sales returns and other allowances  based on historical experience  at the time we recognize revenue 
investments accounting standards require us to record available for sale securities at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses being reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
we follow the accounting standards to assess whether our investments with loss positions are other than temporarily impaired 
we follow the hierarchal approach established under the accounting standards to determine fair value of our investments 
the accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
our fair value estimates consider  among other factors  the collateral underlying the security investments  creditworthiness of the counterparty  timing of expected future cash flows  and  in the case of ars investments  the probability of a successful auction in a future period 
we follow the guidance provided to estimate fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability  and to determine circumstances that may indicate that a transaction is not orderly 
further  we use judgment in evaluating whether a decline in fair value is temporary or other than temporary and consider the following indicators changes in credit ratings or asset quality  changes in the economic environment  length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis  changes in market conditions  and changes in expected cash flows 
we do not intend to sell the investments and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis 
temporary declines in fair value are recorded as charges to accumulated other comprehensive income in the equity section of our balance sheet  while other than temporary declines in fair value are bifurcated between credit losses  which are charged to earnings  and noncredit losses  which depending on facts and circumstances may be charged to other comprehensive income or earnings 

table of contents inventory we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we base our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
sudden declines in demand  rapid product improvements  or technological changes  or any combination of these factors can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the following factors influence our estimates changes to or cancellations of customer orders  unexpected decline in demand  rapid product improvements and technological advances  and termination or changes by our oem customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions 
periodically  we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order 
in those circumstances in which our customer has cancelled its order and we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers  we consider a write down to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value 
we charge write downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete  slow moving  and non usable inventory to net realizable value to cost of revenue 
the effect of these write downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory  which we do not subsequently write up 
we also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays or order cancellations 
business combinations we have applied significant estimates and judgments in order to determine the fair value of the identified assets acquired  liabilities assumed  goodwill recognized  and contingent consideration recorded in connection with our business combinations to ensure the value of the assets and liabilities acquired are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date 
in measuring the fair value  we utilize valuation techniques consistent with the market approach  income approach  or cost approach 
the valuation of the identifiable assets and liabilities includes assumptions made in performing the valuation  such as projected revenue  weighted average cost of capital  discount rates  estimated useful lives  estimated probabilities of achieving contingent payment milestones  and other relevant assessments 
these assessments can be significantly affected by our estimates  judgments  and assumptions 
we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be material changes to our estimates  judgments  or assumptions 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates  judgments  or assumptions  or if additional or new information arises in the future that affects our fair value estimates  then adjustments to our initial fair value estimates may have a material impact to our purchase accounting or our results of operations 
share based compensation costs we account for employee share based compensation costs in accordance with relevant accounting standards 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of certain employee share based compensatory awards  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected volatility and expected life 
historical and implied volatilities were used in estimating the fair value of our share based awards 
the expected life for our options was previously estimated based on historical trends since our initial public offering 
in fiscal  we began to grant options with a contractual life of seven years rather than ten years and now use the simplified method of establishing the expected life as we did not have any history of options with seven year lives 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
estimated forfeitures for share based awards that are not expected to vest are estimated based on historical trends since our initial public offering 
we charge the estimated fair value less estimated forfeitures to earnings on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying awards  which is generally four years for our stock options and dsus and up to two years for our employee stock purchase plan 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
as our stock option and our employee stock purchase plan awards have characteristics that differ significantly from traded options  and as changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  our estimate of fair value may not accurately represent the value assigned by a third party in an arms length transaction 
there currently is no market based mechanism to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates derived from the black scholes option pricing model or other allowable valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
while our estimate of fair value and the associated charge to earnings materially affects our results of operations  it has no impact on our cash position 

table of contents there are significant variations among allowable valuation models  and there is a possibility that we may adopt a different valuation model or refine the inputs and assumptions under our current valuation model in the future  resulting in a lack of consistency in future periods 
our current or future valuation model and the inputs and assumptions we make may also lack comparability to other companies that use different models  inputs  or assumptions  and the resulting differences in comparability could be material 
income taxes we recognize federal  foreign  and state current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the then current fiscal year for each tax jurisdiction 
we also recognize federal  foreign  and state deferred tax liabilities or assets for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and our judgment  are not expected to be realized 
if our assumptions  and consequently our estimates  change in the future  the valuation allowance we have established for our deferred tax assets may be changed  which could impact income tax expense 
we use a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  result of operations  or cash flows 
we believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties 
however  our results have in the past  and could in the future  include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved  upon the filing of an amended return  upon a change in facts  circumstances  or interpretation  or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation 
accordingly  our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period 
we consider the operating earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states 
accordingly  no provision has been made for the us federal  state  or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
we recognize tax benefit upon expensing certain share based awards associated with our share based compensation plans  including nonqualified stock options and dsus  but we cannot recognize tax benefit concurrent with the recognition of share based compensation expenses associated with qualified stock options incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
for qualified stock options that vested after we began to expense share based compensation  we recognize tax benefit only in the period when disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock occur  which historically has been up to several years after vesting and in a period when our stock price substantially increases 
for qualified stock options that vested prior to when we began to expense share based compensation  we record the tax benefit directly to additional paid in capital 
as a result  our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates will be subject to greater volatility and  consequently  our ability to estimate reasonably our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates is greatly diminished

common stock purchase program 
in october  our board of directors approved an additional million for the stock repurchase program  expiring in october  bringing the cumulative authorization to million 
the program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  depending upon market conditions and other factors 
the number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases is based on the level of our cash balances  general business and market conditions  and other factors  including alternative investment opportunities 
common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock 
from april through the end of fiscal  we purchased  shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of million 
treasury shares purchased prior to august  were not subject to the stock split on that date  if adjusted for the stock split the average cost would be 
as of the end of fiscal  we had million remaining under our common stock purchase program 
bank credit facility 
we currently maintain a million working capital line of credit with wells fargo bank 
the wells fargo bank revolving line of credit  which expires on september   provides for an interest rate equal to the prime lending rate or basis points above libor  depending on whether we choose a variable or fixed rate  respectively 
we did not borrow any amounts under the line of credit during and subsequent to fiscal million shelf registration 
we have registered an aggregate of million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions  which shares generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance under rule of the securities act unless held by an affiliate of the acquired company  in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of rule 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements over the course of at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our revenue  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  costs related to protecting our intellectual property  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  the timing and costs of procuring  improving  and renovating office space to meet our anticipated employee headcount requirements  our common stock purchase program  and the amount and timing of our investments in  or acquisitions of  other technologies or companies 
further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unexpected business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained 
our non current investments consist of ars investments  which have failed to settle in auctions 
these investments are not liquid  and in the event we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal  unless a future auction on these investments is successful 
based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual 
we also do not anticipate remittances of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be necessary to meet our working capital and other cash requirements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of the end of fiscal in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years convertible senior subordinated notes leases purchase obligations and other commitments total represents both principal and interest payable through the maturity date of the underlying contractual obligation 
purchase obligations and other commitments include payments due under a long term services agreement and inventory purchase obligations with contract manufacturers 
the amounts in the table above exclude unrecognized tax benefits of million 
as of the end of fiscal  we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefits 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any transactions  arrangements  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
we have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off balance sheet financing  liquidity  or market or credit risk support  engage in leasing  hedging  or research and development services  or have other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected in our financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet effective in september  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued updated guidance on goodwill impairment that gives companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment that may allow them to skip the annual two step test and reduce costs 
the updated accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early application is permitted 
this updated guidance becomes effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
this new guidance requires the components of net income and other comprehensive income to be either presented in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity 
while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
this new guidance is effective for our fiscal as this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income  the adoption will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and ars investments 
we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our cash equivalents  investments  and debt obligations as of the end of fiscal in thousands  except average interest rates fiscal year ended june thereafter total fair value assets cash equivalents variable rate money market average interest rate total cash equivalents average interest rate non current investments average interest rate liabilities convertible senior subordinated notes fixed rate amounts average interest rate our convertible senior subordinated notes bear a fixed coupon interest rate of and mature in december the noteholders could require us to repurchase their notes on december   december   or in the event of a fundamental change as described in the indenture governing the notes 
the early repayment of the notes is not reflected in the preceding schedule 
our non current investments  which consist of ars investments  have a par value of million and have failed to settle in auctions beginning in these investments are not liquid  and in the event we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal  unless redeemed by the issuers or a future auction on these investments is successful 
during fiscal  million of our ars investments were redeemed at par and we recognized a gain of  on the redemption of these investments  which is included in impairment of investments  net on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
as there are currently no active markets for our various failed ars investments  we have estimated the fair value of these investments as of the end of fiscal using a trinomial discounted cash flow analysis 
the analysis considered  among other factors the collateral underlying the security investments  the creditworthiness of the counterparty  the timing of expected future cash flows  the probability of a successful auction in a future period  the underlying structure of each investment  the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions  a consideration of the probabilities of default  passing a future auction  or redemption at par for each period  and estimates of the recovery rates in the event of default for each investment 

table of contents when possible  our failed ars investments were compared to other observable market data or securities with similar characteristics 
our estimate of the fair value of our ars investments could fluctuate materially from period to period depending on future market conditions 
contractual maturities for our ars investments are generally greater than five years  with fair value of million maturing from fiscal to fiscal and million maturing from fiscal to fiscal of our ars investments million par value are investment grade  and the remaining million par value are below investment grade 
based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual 
there have been no significant changes in the maturity dates and average interest rates for our cash equivalents and debt obligations subsequent to fiscal foreign currency exchange risk all of our revenue and approximately of our consolidated costs are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been immaterial to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if our operations change and we determine that our foreign exchange exposure has increased  we may consider entering into hedging transactions to mitigate such risk
