item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  we have seen an improvement in our overall financial condition in and compared to  which can be partially attributed to the implementation of these measures 
competition all phases of the business of the bank are highly competitive 
the bank competes with numerous financial institutions  including other commercial banks in the greater fort wayne  warsaw  allen county and kosciusko county market areas in northeast indiana 
in  there were banking institutions  excluding credits unions  with total locations throughout allen county 
this compares to banking institutions with locations in the three largest banks in allen county are jp morgan chase  wells fargo  and pnc  and they comprise approximately of the deposit market share as of june  at june   we ranked fourth in allen county with almost of the deposit market share 
we have ranked fourth since the bank  along with other commercial banks  competes with respect to its lending activities and competes in attracting demand deposits 
the bank also faces competition from thrift institutions  credit unions and other banks as well as finance companies  insurance companies  mortgage companies  securities brokerage firms  money market funds  trust companies and other providers of financial services 
many of the bank s competitors have been in business for many years longer than the bank  have established customer bases  and are larger and have larger lending limits than the bank 
the bank competes for loans principally through its ability to communicate effectively with its customers and understand and meet their needs 
the bank offers personal attention  professional service  off site atm capability and competitive interest rates 
management believes that its personal service philosophy enhances the bank s ability to compete favorably in attracting individuals and small to medium sized businesses 
employees as of december   we had employees  including approximately full time equivalents 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
management believes that its relationship with our employees is good

risk factors 
our profitability is subject to risks described under this section on risk factors described below 
although the following are not necessarily the only ones facing our company  our business  financial condition or results of operations they could be materially adversely affected by many of the following risks 
an investment in shares of our common stock involves various risks 
before deciding to invest in our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this annual report on form k and information incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks or by other risks that have not been identified or that we may believe are immaterial or unlikely 
the value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
we operate in a highly regulated banking environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations or by the actions of our regulators 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the idfi  the fdic  as insurer of our deposits  by the federal reserve  as regulator of our bank and holding company and by the us congress and the indiana general assembly 
such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a financial institution and its holding company may engage  and are intended primarily for the protection of the depositors and borrowers of tower bank and for the protection of the fdic insurance fund 
the regulation and supervision by the federal reserve  the idfi and the fdic are not intended to protect the interests of investors in our common stock 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on our operations  the adverse classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  legislation or supervisory action  including enforcement actions  may have a material impact on our operations 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act of  and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq that are applicable to us  have  in recent years  increased the scope  complexity and cost of corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices  including the costs of completing our audit and maintaining our internal controls 
additionally  congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
statutes and regulations affecting our business may be changed at any time and the interpretation of these statutes and regulations by examining authorities may also change 
there can be no assurance that such changes to the statutes and regulations or to their interpretation will not adversely affect our business 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
in addition to governmental supervision and regulation  we are subject to changes in other federal and state laws  including changes in tax laws  which could materially affect the banking industry 
we are subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny with respect to bank secrecy and anti money laundering statutes and regulations 
in recent years  regulators have intensified their focus on the usa patriot act s anti money laundering and bank secrecy act compliance requirements 
there is also increased scrutiny of our compliance with the rules enforced by the office of foreign assets control 
in order to comply with regulations  guidelines and examination procedures in this area  we are required to adopt new policies and procedures and to install new systems 
we cannot be certain that the policies  procedures and systems we have in place or may in the future put in place are or will be successful 
therefore  there is no assurance that in every instance we are and will be in full compliance with these requirements 
recently enacted financial reform legislation will  among other things  create a new consumer financial protection bureau  tighten capital standards and result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations 
on july   president obama signed dodd frank 
this law will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending  deposit  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
dodd frank requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations  and to prepare numerous studies and reports for congress 
the federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations  and consequently  many of the details and much of the impact of dodd frank may not be known for many months or years 
effective july  a provision of dodd frank eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits  thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts 
depending on competitive responses  this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense 
dodd frank also broadens the base for fdic deposit insurance assessments 
assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution  rather than deposits 
dodd frank also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per account  retroactive to january   and non interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through december  the legislation also increases the required minimum reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund  from to of insured deposits  and directs the fdic to offset the effects of increased assessments on depository institutions with less than billion in assets 
dodd frank will require publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non binding vote on executive compensation and so called golden parachute payments  and authorizes the securities and exchange commission to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company s proxy materials 
it also provides that the listing standards of the national securities exchanges shall require listed companies to implement and disclose clawback policies mandating the recovery of incentive compensation paid to executive officers in connection with accounting restatements 
the legislation also directs the federal reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives  regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not 
because we are a smaller reporting company  the requirement for a non binding vote on executive compensation does not apply to our company this year 
dodd frank requires minimum leverage tier and risk based capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are no less than those applicable to banks  which will exclude certain instruments that previously have been eligible for inclusion by bank holding companies as tier capital  such as trust preferred securities 
because our bank has assets of more than million and less than billion  trust preferred securities issued before may  will still be considered tier capital 
while several provisions of dodd frank have been implemented and have not had a significant impact on our operations and financial statements  there are still rules and regulations that are written and yet to be written  that could have a significant impact on community banks 
however  it is expected that at a minimum they will increase our operating and compliance costs and will increase our interest expense 
we may be subject to a higher consolidated effective tax rate if there is a change in tax laws  tax rates  or our ability to record taxable income in the future 
in  we reversed the valuation allowance on our state deferred tax asset 
two events occurred during that made it more likely than not that we will be able to recognize the state deferred tax asset over the next few years 
these two events include reporting a net taxable position over the past three years for federal purposes and the liquidation of our reit 
the valuation allowance was originally placed on the state deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty that the company would ever be able to recognize the asset based on the reit  which has created losses at the state level since its inception in if the company would not post income over the next couple of years as expected  the valuation allowance would need to be placed on the state deferred tax asset and possibly the federal deferred tax asset as well 
this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and additional losses to the company 
we also have a high concentration of investments in municipal bonds 
these bonds are not currently taxable at the federal or state level  therefore  giving us a much better yield than many other investments 
if tax laws would change and require municipal income to be reported as taxable income  we could experience a negative impact on our effective tax rate and our results of operation 
a prolonged economic stagnation in the financial industry and the volatility of domestic and international credit markets may adversely affect our operations and our stock price 
a prolonged general economic stagnation in the financial services industry has resulted in uncertainty in financial markets since in addition  as a consequence of the recession that the united states is now working its way out of  business activity across a wide range of industries face serious difficulties due to the lack of consumer spending and the extreme lack of liquidity in the global credit markets 
unemployment has also increased significantly 
the general economic downturn caused uncertainty in the financial markets over the past couple of years 
commercial  as well as consumer loan portfolio performances  deteriorated at many institutions and the competition for deposits and quality loans increased significantly 
in addition  the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages declined 
bank and bank holding company stock prices have been negatively affected  as has the ability of banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to recent years 
as a result  there is a potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards  and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  including the expected issuance of many formal enforcement orders 
negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets  and the impact of new legislation in response to those developments  may negatively impact our operations by restricting our business operations  including our ability to originate or sell loans  and adversely impact our financial performance or our stock price 
changes in market interest rates have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on our interest earning assets and the interest expense that we may pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
our interest bearing assets generally re price or mature more quickly than our interest earning liabilities 
in  the federal funds rate decreased basis points to a low of at december  the rate remained unchanged from december  through december  in a rising interest rate environment  our net interest margin can be adversely impacted to the extent that our fixed rate loans do not re price approximately of our loans as of december  
we also have interest rate floors on some loans  ranging from to over the prime rate  which will hinder net interest margin growth in a rising interest rate environment until the prime rate breaks through the floor rates 
also in this situation  rates paid on non term deposit accounts will rise  thus also decreasing our margin 
additionally  deposit customers may move funds from savings accounts to higher rate certificate of deposit accounts 
in a falling interest rate environment  however  our net interest margin could likewise be negatively affected  as competitive pressures might require us to decrease our lending interest rates  while these same competitive pressures could keep us from further reducing interest payment rates on our deposits 
such movements  therefore  could cause a decrease in our interest rate spread and net interest margin 
we are also subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities 
decreases in interest rates often result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities  as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowing costs 
under these circumstances  we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments in loans or other investments that have interest rates that are comparable to the interest on our existing loans and securities 
moreover  increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand  in which event our results of operations may be adversely affected by the amount of non interest expenses associated with mortgage banking activities  such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expense  equipment and data processing costs and other operating costs 
changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest earning assets and  in particular  our securities portfolio held for investment 
generally  the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale  therefore  could have an adverse effect on stockholders equity 
technological advances may adversely impact our business 
the banking industry is undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to improving customer services  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do to does to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or successfully market such products and services to our customers 
a breach of information security or a breakdown in our data storage and distribution systems could adversely affect our earnings 
increasingly  we depend upon data processing  communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks  and over the internet 
we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or that they may not from time to time malfunction  due either to human error or mechanical failure  despite safeguards we have instituted 
in addition  we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs 
if information security is breached  information can be lost or misappropriated  resulting in financial loss or costs to us or damages to others 
these costs or losses could materially exceed the amount of insurance coverage  if any  which could adversely affect our earnings 
strong competition within the bank s market area has hurt and could continue to hurt our profits and slow our growth 
competition in our banking and financial services competitive market area  both in making loans and in attracting deposits  is intense  and our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in both arenas 
we compete in the greater fort wayne  warsaw  allen county and kosciusko county market areas of northeast indiana  with numerous commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms 
many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things our ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets 
our ability to maintain and expand our market position 
the scope  relevance and pricing of our products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands 
the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors 
customer satisfaction with our level of service 
industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
price competition for loans and deposits might result in the bank earning less on loans and paying more for deposits  which would reduce net interest income and adversely affect our results 
competition also may make it more difficult to attract deposits and  consequently  to grow loans 
we have relatively high amounts of commercial  commercial real estate and commercial development loans  and these loans are higher risk than residential mortgage loans 
we generally invest a greater proportion of our assets in loans secured by business assets and commercial real estate than financial institutions that invest a greater proportion of their assets in loans secured by single family residences 
commercial real estate  commercial business and development loans generally involve a higher degree of credit risk than residential mortgage lending  due primarily to the relatively larger amounts loaned to individual borrowers 
while we did not engage in the business of sub prime lending  our construction  land development and land loan portfolio  along with our commercial loan portfolio and certain of our other loans  has been adversely affected by the recent downturn in the residential and commercial real estate market 
moreover  many of our borrowers also have more than one commercial real estate  commercial business or development loan outstanding with us or with other institutions  and the turmoil in the credit markets has made it more difficult for them to continue and sustain their prior business levels  thereby reducing their available cash flows 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship could expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results 
we have an elevated amount of non performing assets  which could result in an increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our net interest margin and our results 
a loan is considered non performing when full collection of principal and interest in accordance with the loan contract is not probable 
while our non performing assets remain elevated  we have experienced a decline of million in compared to december  this brings our nonperforming assets to total assets ratio to at december  compared to at december  these and other non performing loans  even if they are eventually collected  in whole or in part  take longer periods of time to work out  which result in loss of income and or principal during the workout period  and also require additional resources 
we may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  especially due to our level of non performing assets 
a loan is considered non performing when full collection of principal and interest in accordance with the loan contract is not probable 
due to the decrease in the level of non performing assets from million at december  to million at december   we saw a decrease in our provision for loan losses from million in to million in net charge offs were million in compared to million in while our asset quality is improving  our non performing assets remain at elevated levels 
this was indicative of the recessionary period in the economy and or our local real estate market  which we are working our way out of 
as such  some of our currently performing assets may not continue to perform according to their terms  and the value of the collateral may become insufficient to pay the remaining loan balances 
if this occurs  we may experience additional loan losses  which could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date 
however  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect our operating results 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors  including our historical charge off experience  status of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and classified loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position and estimated collateral values  to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors  including general and economic business conditions  anticipated duration of the current business downturn  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are  by nature  more subjective and fluid 
our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding our borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments  competitive challenges and other factors 
because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change  our actual losses may vary from our current estimates 
federal regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense  or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge offs 
any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge offs  as required by these regulatory agencies  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our reliance on our funding of health savings accounts hsa as the main source for overall deposit growth could be adversely affected by health care reform 
over the last few years  hsas have become our main focus in deposit growth due to the long term nature of the deposit and its low cost of funds 
in  our hsa balances increased by million  or  to million 
these deposits had an average rate of in  which contributed to the increase in our net interest margin from in to in hsas have become very popular over the last few years as healthcare costs are at all time highs 
hsas are only available to those with a high deductible health plan hdhp to help consumers save for medical costs 
in addition  the contributions to the account up to a specified amount are tax deductible 
recent proposed legislation could significantly weaken the current advantage of having an hsa or possibly eliminate the need for these accounts 
while it is expected to take years to implement the law  we could begin seeing changes as early as if the law is passed 
some of the changes could include requiring insurance plans to provide first dollar coverage for preventative care requiring insurance policies to meet minimum medical loss ratios requiring insurance policies to provide essential benefits placing a ceiling on the deductibles paid by the consumer requiring insurance policies to meet a minimum actuarial value if these changes are implemented  we could experience a significant decline in are balances in this product 
if policies do not meet the criteria listed above  they will not be considered a qualified plan and cannot be offered by the insurance company 
also  by putting caps on deductibles  employers could not select a hdhp with deductibles over the stated amounts unless they make up the difference 
a decline in these balances could lead to an increase in net interest margin and decrease our results of operations 
we have relatively high amounts invested in municipalities and these have more risk than a government backed agency 
we generally invest a greater proportion of our long term investments in municipal securities than financial institutions in our peer group  who typically invest a greater proportion of their long term investments in government backed agencies 
the market value of our municipal investments were million  or of our total long term investments  at december  as a result of recent economic conditions  some municipalities are struggling to meet financial obligations 
we have certain municipal investment securities which are subject to credit risk if the municipalities are unable to meet their obligations to us 
in addition  certain bond insurers have filed bankruptcy in recent months 
although we believe the municipalities will be able to meet their obligations  there can be no certainty regarding future results 
an adverse development with respect to one or more securities could expose us to a greater risk of loss and could have a material impact on our business and results 
we rely on dividends from our subsidiary for most of our revenue because we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the bank and its subsidiary  the trust company  we typically depend upon dividends from one or both of these entities for a substantial portion of our revenues 
our ability to pay dividends  internally or to stockholders  is currently prohibited by the written agreement 
for details regarding the written agreement  refer to the bank regulation written agreement section of item  business 
once this is lifted  our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders will therefore continue to depend in large part upon our receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from the bank 
from time to time  we may also become a party to financing agreements or other contractual arrangements that may have the effect of limiting or prohibiting us or our bank subsidiary from declaring or paying dividends 
our holding company expenses and interest obligations on our trust preferred securities and corresponding subordinated debt securities issued by us may limit or impair our ability to declare or pay dividends 
payment of dividends will depend on our future financial condition and performance and may be restricted 
paying dividends on our capital stock is strictly prohibited by the written agreement with the federal reserve and the idfi 
for details regarding the written agreement  refer to the bank regulation written agreement section of item  business 
once our written agreement restrictions are lifted  any future dividends will depend upon the board s assessment of our operating and financial condition  projected cash needs  contractual restrictions and any further restrictions imposed on us by our banking regulators 
from time to time  we may also become a party to financing agreements or other contractual arrangements that may have the effect of limiting or prohibiting the company from declaring or paying dividends 
we have issued trust preferred securities that prevent us from paying dividends on our capital stock in the event that we defer our interest payment obligations on the trust preferred debt 
in february  we notified the trustees of the trust preferred securities that we elected to defer interest payments on the securities indefinitely since the first quarter of therefore  we did not pay dividends in or and will not be able to pay dividends on our capital stock until  at a minimum  we pay the interest due on the trust preferred securities 
we depend heavily on our key banking and management personnel 
our success depends in part on its ability to attract and retain key executives and to attract and retain qualified and productive banking officers  who have experience both in sophisticated banking matters and in operating small to mid size banks 
these qualities are essential both for effective executive management and also for the growth and expansion of the bank s customer base for loans and deposits 
competition for such personnel is strong in the local banking industry  and we compete with many other banks and financial institutions  some of them with financial resources and benefits greater than ours  for such individuals 
in this market environment  we may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel we require for future growth 
we expect to effectively compete in this area by offering financial packages that include incentive based compensation and the opportunity to join in the rewarding work of building a growing bank 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
our written agreement with the federal reserve may further impair our operations or restrict our growth 
pursuant to our written agreement with the federal reserve  we are subject to significant governmental supervision and regulation as described in the bank regulation written agreement section of item  business of this form k

prior to the sale of the trust company to the bank on december   the trust company was able to make small dividend payments to the holding company  such as the  dividends paid in both and there were no dividend payments made in or our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders continues to depend primarily on the bank s ability to pay dividends to the company

permission was granted in january by the federal reserve and a quarterly dividend of was declared and paid for the first quarter of in the second quarter of  however  our board of directors elected to forego the declaration of dividends indefinitely

other contributing factors to the increase were the  decrease in provision expense  the  increase in net interest income  and the  increase in noninterest income 
offsetting these increases to net income was an increase in noninterest expenses of  net interest income increased from to due primarily to an increase in net interest margin from to 
in  we implemented interest rate floors on loans  which helped to maintain our net interest margin in and the increase in net interest margin in and was due to aggressively reducing deposit rates  while keeping them consistent with local market rates 
we also focused on changing our mix of deposits  which was reflected in the decrease in certificate of deposits that tend to pay higher rates 
these actions were in response to short term interest rates taking a basis point decline from a fed funds rate of to a low of in december where they remained through december  also contributing to the decrease in interest expense was the decrease in our trust preferred debt securities interest rate  as the million of the million is now on a floating rate based on three month libor 
the weighted average rate decreased from in to in the remainder of our trust preferred debt moves to a floating rate on march  non interest income increased by  from to primarily due to increase of  in mortgage banking income   in net debit card interchange income  and  in bank owned life insurance boli income 
these increases were offset by decreases of  on the gain on sale of securities and  in trust and brokerage fee income 
provision expense declined by  from to as a result of an improvement of million in our nonperforming loans from december  to december  provision expense remained at an elevated level primarily due to reporting million of net charge offs in  which adversely impacts the allowance for loan losses 
operating expenses increased  or  from to primarily due to the increase in salaries and benefits expense of million and the increase in data processing expenses of  salaries and benefits expenses increased due to an increase in the average number of full time equivalent employees  a larger profit sharing plan pool due to higher income  and specific incentive plan expenses 
the incentive plans were specific to as they were based on triggers that applied only to  which included a reduction in classified assets and reaching specific net income milestones 
these increases in noninterest expense were offset by decreases of  in fdic premiums due to a reduction in our assessment rate and  in other real estate owned oreo expenses 
income taxes decreased by million from to primarily due to reversing the valuation allowances on both our state book to tax timing differences and our state net operating losses 
as a result of the liquidation of our nevada investment subsidiary in september  it became more likely than not that we will be able to realize these items over the next few years  which will be well within the carry forward period 
total assets increased by million  or  from the prior year 
the primary reason for this increase was due to two customers depositing approximately million temporarily in december due to the short term nature of these deposits  we kept these funds in our cash and cash equivalents  which caused the increase of million in this category from december  to december  there was also a purposeful reallocation of our assets in from total loans  which decreased by million  to securities available for sale and bank owned life insurance  which increased million and million  respectively 
asset quality and liquidity continued to be a major focus of the bank in  as we worked to turn our non performing assets into income producing assets 
we believe this strategy led to the million decrease in our nonperforming assets 
total deposits increased by million  or  from december  to december  the increase was due to a million increase in noninterest bearing deposits offset by a decrease of million in interest bearing deposits 
of the million increase in noninterest bearing deposits  approximately million was from the extremely short term deposits from two customers  which will be withdrawn from the bank by the end of january also reported in the noninterest bearing category was approximately million of deposits transferred from money market accounts so that a new product can be created internally to be able to offer our customers sweep accounts 
these funds will be categorized as interest bearing demand deposit accounts upon the completion of the new product in early january health savings accounts continue to be a high growth  low cost product for us which is reflected by increases in balances of million from to and million from to as of december   we had over  active health savings accounts and we expect to receive another large deposit of approximately million in january into these accounts when our customers make their employer contributions 
brokered deposits have decreased from million at december  to million at december  during  we strategically purchased brokered certificates of deposit and brokered money markets to take advantage of the favorable rate environment to lock in low rates for an extended period of time 
during  we purchased new brokered certificates of deposit to replace maturities as needed 
the average rate on our brokered certificates of deposit purchases in was with a weighted average life of just more than five years 
these strategic decisions allowed us to grow our net interest margin year to date at december  to from at december  core deposits now comprise of total deposits  compared to in the prior year 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
additions to the allowance may result from recording provision for loan losses and recoveries  while charge offs are deducted from the allowance 
allocation of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any loan charged off 
we have an established process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that relies on various procedures and pieces of information to arrive at a range of probable outcomes 
no single statistic or measurement  in itself  determines the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance has two components identified specific allocations and a percentage allocation based on loss history for different loan groups 
to determine the allocated component of the allowance  we combine estimated allowances required for specifically identified loans that are analyzed individually and loans that are analyzed on a group basis 
first  management allocates specific portions of the allowance for loan losses based on identifiable problem loans 
problem loans are identified through a loan risk rating system and monitored through watch list reporting 
the amount of impairment  or specific reserve  is calculated by using the present value of expected cash flows or the fair value of the underlying collateral less cost to sell as required by asc second  management s evaluation of the allowance for different loan groups is based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of our borrowers  industry concentrations within the loan portfolio and general economic conditions 
lastly  the unallocated component of the allowance is maintained to supplement the allocated component and to recognize the imprecision of estimating and measuring loss when evaluating loss allocations for individual loans or pools of loans 
the allocated and the unallocated components represent the total allowance for loan losses that under normal circumstances should adequately cover probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
actual loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that a loan or a portion thereof is uncollectible 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for smaller balance loans of a similar nature such as residential mortgage and consumer loans  and on an individual loan basis for other loans 
commercial loans and mortgage loans secured by other properties are evaluated individually for impairment 
when analysis of a borrower s operating results and financial condition indicates that underlying cash flows of the borrower s business are not adequate to meet its debt service requirements  the loan is evaluated for impairment 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing interest rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
there are many factors affecting judgment calls relating to allowances for loan losses 
some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although we believe our process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
results of operations summary we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   which was the highest annual net income reported in our history 
this was a million increase from net income of million reported in and a million increase from the million net loss reported in net income per diluted share of reflects an increase of from net income in and a increase from the net loss reported in net interest income increased from  which was reflective of the increase in our net interest margin from to  but offset by a million decrease in average earning assets 
noninterest income increased by  or  primarily due to increases in mortgage banking income and net debit card interchange income 
the increase in noninterest income was offset by decrease in trust and brokerage income and gain on sales of securities compared to noninterest expenses increased by  due to an increase in salaries and benefits of million  offset by decreases in fdic premiums of  and oreo expenses of  an income tax benefit was recorded in the amount of million primarily due to the reversal of the valuation allowance on our state deferred tax asset 
net interest income net interest income  the difference between revenue generated from earning assets and the interest cost of funding those assets  is our primary source of earnings 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  netting million in net interest income 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  netting million in net interest income 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  resulting in million in net interest income 
the increase of  in net interest income in from was due to an increase in net interest margin  which was offset by a purposeful decrease in total loans 
the net interest margin  or net yield on average earning assets  increased to in from in and in the increase in net interest margin in and was due to aggressively reducing deposit rates  while keeping them consistent with local market rates  and restructuring our deposit mix by reducing our higher cost in market certificate of deposits 
offsetting the increase in net interest margin was a decrease of million in average earning assets from to these actions were a continued response to the low interest rate environment which has existed since december when the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rates to 
deposit costs also decreased as a result of a shift from certificates of deposit to lower cost core deposits  such as non interest bearing checking accounts  interest bearing checking accounts  savings  and money market accounts  which had average balances increase by million  million  million  and million  respectively  from the average balances in hsas were the primary increase in interest bearing checking as they increased by million from december  to december  these hsas had an average rate of and have been one of our driving forces in reducing our cost of funds in and the level of net interest income is primarily a function of asset size  as the weighted average interest rate received on earning assets is greater than the weighted average interest cost of funding sources  however  factors such as types of assets and liabilities  interest rate risk  liquidity  asset quality  and customer behavior also impact net interest income as well as the net yield

average loans comprised   and of average earning assets during   and  respectively 
during  the loan portfolio had an average yield of  and earned million  or of total interest income  a decrease of million from this decrease in loans was offset by increases in both short term and long term investments 
the increase of  in net interest income in from was the net result of a reduction in interest expense outpacing the reduction in interest income  resulting in an increase in net interest margin as average earning assets decreased by only million 
during  the loan portfolio had an average yield of and earned million  or of total interest income 
during  the loan portfolio had an average yield of and earned million  or of total interest income 
the total average securities portfolio and total average short term investments equaled and  respectively  of average earning assets

savings deposits and interest bearing checking accounts totaled of average interest bearing liabilities during with an average rate of 
total borrowings had an average rate of and cost million of interest expense during in december  million of our trust preferred debt securities went to a floating rate of three month libor plus  which lowered our costs from that funding type by  or 
this reduced the average rate on this funding from for the year ending december  to for the year ending december  we expect another decrease in interest expense from this funding beginning in march as the remaining million on our balance sheet will move to a floating rate of three month libor plus 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million for  million for  and million for in  our focus was on reducing nonperforming and classified assets through various methods  including charging down loans  selling loans  and working with our customers to move these loans to other financial institutions 
this strategy resulted in net charge offs of million 
while a portion of the expense was recorded to replenish the reserve after the million in charge offs  we previously had million reserved on those relationships as of december  we also received  in recoveries that offset the charge offs taken in and assisted in replenishing our allowance 
there were three commercial real estate relationships  two commercial relationships  and one residential real estate relationship that were downgraded to an impairment status in requiring additional reserves totaling million 
we also had one non accrual commercial loan requiring additional reserves in in the amount of  for  a portion of provision expense was recorded to replenish the reserve as it is used to charge off or charge down loans 
another portion of the expense was used to increase reserves on three commercial real estate relationships and one commercial relationship that were deemed impaired in or and required additional reserves of approximately million in due to a decrease in collateral values 
the provision expense recorded in reflected a million decrease from the provision expense recorded in was primarily due to significant charge offs related to a group of pre residential real estate development loans made up of different parties within the same development 
the economic downturn also had an effect on a few commercial loan relationships requiring specific reserves and charge offs due to liquidation of those businesses in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding was   and at december    and  respectively 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level management feels is adequate to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
the evaluation is based upon our historical loan loss experience  along with the banking industry s historical loan loss experience  as well as known and inherent risks contained in the loan portfolio  composition and growth of the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions and other factors 
we had million of nonperforming loans at december   a decrease of million from million in nonperforming loans at december  the decrease in nonperforming loans is a direct result of the company s focus to improve asset quality and profitability 
of the million decrease in nonperforming loans  million was due to a decrease in troubled debt restructured loans 
the decrease in troubled debt restructured loans was the result of million of loans from moving to a performing status and adding two new relationships to the category in the amount of million during we reported million of net charge offs  or of average loans  during compared to million in net charge offs  or of average loans  during and million in net charge offs during net loans decreased during by million  or approximately  due to the company s focus on improving asset quality  profitability  and liquidity 
we had million  million  and million of nonperforming loans at december    and  respectively 
classified assets are comprised of accruing substandard  troubled debt restructurings  and non accrual loans  along with impaired investments and other real estate owned 
classified assets reached their peak at the end of the third quarter of at million 
we have made steady progress over the past few years to reduce these assets by million  or  from million at december  the classified assets ratio is a key indicator used by our regulators to analyze asset quality at financial institutions 
it is calculated by dividing classified assets by the sum of tier capital and the allowance for loan losses alll 
at december   our classified assets were  which shows improvement from on december  and on december  our goal is for this ratio to be at or below 
the following table presents the classified assets annually from december  to december  december december december classified loans substandard accruing troubled debt restructurings substandard loans held for sale nonaccrual total classified loans impaired securities other real estate owned total classified assets tier capital and alll classifed asset ratio noninterest income total noninterest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the  increase from was primarily due to a  increase in mortgage banking income and a  increase in net debit card interchange income 
mortgage banking income increased primarily due to an increase in the origination fee we charge our customers on each loan  a basis point increase in the internal rate that we have set to be able to sell a mortgage loan  and an increase in our mortgage loan commitment pipeline leading to a fair value adjustment on loans committed to be sold with interest rate lock commitments 
the increase in net debit card interchange income was primarily due to the increase in the number of debit cards outstanding and the conversion to another service provider  who charges less for debit card transaction processing  in february of these increases were offset by decreases of  and  in our trust and brokerage fee income and our gain on sale of securities  respectively 
trust and brokerage fees were down due to a million decrease in assets under management throughout the gain on the sale of securities has decreased from due to an opportunity to recognize a large gain on the sale of a group of held to maturity securities held at our holding company during the third quarter of in the amount of  we recorded  in gains in through restructuring opportunities within the market  we were able to recognize some gains and reinvest the proceeds with minimal impact to the portfolio yield 
deposit service charges and other than temporary impairment otti remained relatively unchanged when comparing to other income increased  primarily due to increases in fees from letters of credit by approximately  and increases in rental income from our oreo properties of approximately  noninterest expense noninterest expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  or  during over the increase in expenses is attributable to an increase of million in salaries and benefits and an increase of  in data processing costs 
these increases were offset by decreases of  and  in fdic premiums and oreo expenses  respectively  in during  salaries and benefits increased by million compared to there were a few reasons for the increase  including an increase in the average number of full time employees employed during the year  an increase in incentive program expenses from an improvement in earnings and improvements in asset quality  and an increase in k employer matching contributions 
while we ended the year with the same number of employees as in  we employed more employees on average in than in due to an improvement in earnings of million compared to  there was an increase in the profit sharing pool  which accounts for approximately  of the increase in salaries and benefits expense 
we also had an increase of approximately  in salaries and benefits due primarily to two incentive programs that were specific to for asset quality improvement and reaching specific earnings milestones 
finally  we matched employee contributions to their k plans for the entire year of compared to only the second half of when the match was reinstated 
salary and benefit costs were million in and were of total noninterest expenses 
data processing costs increased by  primarily due to an increase in the number of deposit accounts and the purchase of additional services and or products from our core processing vendor 
the cost of our core processing system is primarily based on the number of accounts we have open  which continues to increase annually due to the high volume of health savings accounts opened each year 
we opened approximately  health savings account in  of which most of them were opened in january 
the base price per account also increases as new services and or products are added 
offsetting the increase in noninterest expenses were decreases in fdic premiums and oreo expenses of  and  respectively 
due to industry wide decreases in fdic assessment rates for determining insurance premiums in the first quarter of coupled with the additional decrease in our fdic assessment rates during the second quarter of  we experienced a decrease in our fdic premiums during compared the reduction in oreo expense was two fold 
first  there was a reduction in the additions to oreo  which was million of additions in compared to million of additions in second  the values of the properties did not decrease as much as in prior years  which would trigger a write down of the property to fair value 
of the remaining noninterest expenses  no individual line item increased or decreased more than  business development expenses increased  or 
the increase in this category was primarily due to a new charitable contribution for compliance with the community reinvestment act 
we pledged two securities to a local charity  of which they will receive distributions totaling of the principal value of these investments annually 
this will be an ongoing expense and accounted for approximately  of our business development expense in while loan and professional expenses remained relatively unchanged  we did experience a shift in the type of services provided 
we had additional fees for accounting and legal fees for strategic purposes compared to additional fees for asset quality issues and costs for complying with our written agreement 
salary and benefit costs were million in and were of total noninterest expenses 
occupancy and equipment expenses are the second largest expense at million and were of total noninterest expense in loan and professional costs were reported in the amount of million  which consisted of legal expenses associated with elevated levels of nonperforming assets and items pertaining to the written agreement 
premiums for deposit insurance from the fdic were million  or  of total noninterest expense 
real estate market values continued to decline in causing write downs and professional expenses of million on properties that have moved to other real estate owned 
salary and benefit costs were million in and were of total noninterest expenses 
loan and professional costs increased during from prior year levels by  or 
loan and professional expenses in increased to million due to entering into a consulting engagement to have our lending staffing and processes analyzed 
these expenses also increased due to additional costs associated with the workout of non performing assets 
premiums for deposit insurance from the fdic increased in to million  of which  was due to an industry wide one time special assessment of  real estate market values remained low in causing write downs and professional expenses of million on properties that have moved to other real estate owned 
monitoring and controlling overhead expenses while providing high quality service to customers is of the utmost importance to us 
the efficiency ratio  computed by dividing noninterest expense by net interest income plus noninterest income  was in compared to in and in the efficiency ratio decreased in and from prior years primarily due to increases in total revenues 
the efficiency ratio was slightly higher in due to the decrease in net interest income caused by steep interest rate cuts taken in that remained unchanged in through during and  we made significant strides in improving our net interest margin  which translated into improved net interest income  through disciplined actions required to decrease nonperforming assets and an aggressive approach for pricing deposits 
income taxes expense we recorded a tax benefit of million and million in and compared to tax expense of  in the tax benefit recorded in was the direct result of reversing the valuation allowance previously set up on the state deferred tax asset created by our book to tax timing differences at the state level and our state net operating losses created by our reit 
releasing the valuation allowance on the state deferred tax assets in was triggered by two events during the year that made it more likely than not that we will realize the state deferred tax asset within the next few years 
first  we have a net taxable income position over the past three years for federal purposes and we don t expect that to change in the foreseeable future 
second  we liquidated our reit at the end of the third quarter of  which will create state taxable income going forward  if we continue to produce a profit as expected 
the effective tax rate for was 
during  we recorded tax expense of  compared to million of tax benefit in the effective tax rate recorded for was as compared to for the low effective tax rate in was primarily due to modest levels of income offset by tax exempt investment income derived from investing in municipal bonds and bank owned life insurance 
the income tax benefit recorded in was the result of a net loss posted and was amplified by placing a valuation allowance on our state deferred tax asset due to determining that our state deferred tax asset created from the state net operating loss from our reit was more likely than not unrealizable 
capital sources stockholders equity is a noninterest bearing source of funds  which provides support for asset growth 
stockholders equity was million and million at december  and  respectively 
affecting the increase in stockholders equity during was million in net income and million in unrealized gains  net of tax  on available for sale securities 
additionally  we recorded  of stock compensation expense 
the company and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet the various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements 
currently  both the company and the bank have been categorized as well capitalized  the highest classification contained within the banking regulations 
the capital ratios of the company and the bank as of december  and are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in we refined our capital contingency plan and we have established new internal minimum capital levels that are in excess of those required by the regulators to remain well capitalized 
the plan provides that our total risk based capital ratio should be equal to or greater than and our leverage ratio should be equal to or greater than 
our ability to pay cash and stock dividends is subject to limitations under various laws and regulations and to prudent and sound banking practices 
prior to no cash or stock dividends were paid 
in december  our board of directors formally approved the payment of dividends commencing in calendar this was based on an analysis of our liquidity needs  regulatory and capital requirements  and results of operations 
during  we paid dividends at annual rate of per share payable in four quarterly installments 
this was increased in by  which resulted in dividends paid totaling per share 
in january  our board of directors voted to pay a dividend of per share for the first quarter dividend payment 
in the second quarter of  however  we elected to forego the declaration of dividends on our common stock indefinitely 
the decision was based on the desire to retain capital and hedge against challenging economic and banking industry conditions as well as to maintain tower bank s current well capitalized status within the federal reserve system 
on may   we entered into a written agreement with the federal reserve and the idfi  effective april  the written agreement 
for more detail regarding the written agreement  refer to bank regulation written agreement section of item  business 
one of the requirements in the written agreement was that we not pay dividends on or redeem any of our common or preferred stock or other capital stock  or make any payments of interest on its trust preferred debt  without written approval from the federal reserve 
in response to these requirements  no preferred stock dividends  common stock dividends or trust preferred debt interest payments were made in or liquidity and capital ratios december  loan to deposit ratio loan to funding ratio total risk based capital tier risk based capital tier leverage capital liquidity liquidity is measured by our ability to raise funds through deposits  borrowed funds  capital or cash flow from the repayment of loans and investment securities 
these funds are used to meet depositor withdrawals  maintain reserve requirements  to fund loans and to fund operational expenses 
liquidity is primarily achieved through the growth of deposits and liquid assets such as securities available for sale  cash flow from securities  matured securities  and federal funds sold 
asset and liability management is the process of managing the balance sheet to achieve a mix of earning assets and liabilities that maximize profitability while providing adequate liquidity 
our liquidity strategy is to fund growth with deposits from both in market and out of market sources  federal home loan bank borrowings and to maintain an adequate level of short term and medium term investments to meet typical daily loan and deposit activity needs 
we were able to utilize the million decline in net loans in to increase liquidity through the purchase of securities and boli  which reported increases of million and million in included in total deposits at december  was approximately million of extremely short term deposits from two customers 
these two deposits are expected to be withdrawn during the first quarter  but will be offset with deposits of approximately million from the employer and employee funding of hsas in january we do not expect any undue stress on our funding when these two large deposits are withdrawn as they are held in cash and cash equivalents at december  overall deposits increased by million compared to an increase in deposits from to of million 
we mainly generate deposits from in market sources  however  we also include national  non brokered certificates of deposit  borrowings from the fhlb and trust preferred securities in our funding base 
at december  and december   the balances in brokered deposits  which included both money market accounts and certificates of deposit  were million and million  respectively 
fhlb advances increased by million from million at december  to million at december  we expect little to no growth in the loan portfolio through funding for the loan portfolio will continue to come from in market sources through the marketing of products and the development of branch locations 
we will also continue to develop wholesale and out of market deposits and borrowing capacities and use them to augment interest rate sensitivity strategies and liquidity capabilities and to diversify the funding base of the bank 
we have the ability to borrow money on a daily basis through correspondent banks federal funds purchased along with borrowings from the federal reserve discount window  and had no borrowings at december  and additional capacity to borrow overnight in the form of unused lines of commitment from correspondent banks totaled million at december  and million at december  the unused line at the discount window totaled million at december  and december  we view this type of funding as a secondary and temporary source of funds 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet risk in addition to normal loan funding and deposit flow  we also need to maintain liquidity to meet the demands of certain unfunded loan commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit 
the bank maintains off balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
loan commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer at any time  as the customer s needs vary  as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we monitor fluctuations in loan balances and commitment levels and include such data in our overall liquidity management 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized  if any  in the balance sheet 
the bank s maximum exposure to loan loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the face amount of these instruments 
commitments to extend credit are recorded when they are funded and standby letters of credit are recorded at fair value 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
collateral  such as accounts receivable  securities  inventory  property and equipment  is generally required based on management s credit assessment of the borrower 
tower financial corporation  the bank  and the trust company occupy their respective headquarters  offices and other facilities under long term operating leases and  in addition  are parties to long term contracts for data processing and operating systems 
we refer you to the discussion at item properties and to the section herein on related person transactions for additional information regarding our long term leases

related persons transactions are subject to our statement of policy for the review  approval or ratification of transactions with related persons 
a copy of this policy is available on our website at www 
towerbank 
net 
the policy applies to any transaction with a related person 
under our policy  a related person is a person who is  or at any time since the beginning of our last fiscal year was a director or executive officer  a nominee to become a director  a stockholder who beneficially owns or more of our common stock  an immediate family member that is  a spouse  child  parent  sibling  or an in law of any of the foregoing persons  as well as any entity which is owned or controlled by any of such persons or of which such person is a general partner or a or greater beneficial owner or any other person identified by our audit committee or our board of directors as a related person for purposes of this policy 
once a person has been identified as related person and if tower financial corporation or any subsidiary is a participant  then if the aggregate amount involved in the transaction exceeds  and the related person has a direct or indirect interest other than simply as a result of being a director or less than a beneficial owner of the entity involved the transaction must be considered  approved or ratified by the audit committee 
we have established the threshold transactional amount at  which triggers the review  even though applicable sec regulations set the threshold at  we have done this so that even smaller transactions with related persons will be reviewed for fairness and appropriateness 
employment of a related person in the ordinary course of business consistent with our policies and practices with respect to the employment of non related persons in similar positions so long as the related person is not an executive officer required to be reported in our annual proxy statement is not subject to the policy 
transactions involving competitive bids or transactions involving services as a bank depository  transfer agent  registrar  or trustee are considered pre approved for purposes of our policy 
all other transactions subject to our policy must be approved in advance by the audit committee  unless our chief executive officer or chief financial officer determines that it is impractical to wait until an audit committee meeting 
in such event  the chair of the audit committee may review and approve the proposed related person transaction but shall then promptly report any such approval to the full audit committee 
all material facts respecting the related person transaction must be disclosed to the audit committee 
in the event that we become aware of a related person transaction that has not been approved prior to its consummation  the matter must then still be reviewed by the audit committee  which will then review all relevant facts and circumstances  shall evaluate all available options including ratification  revision or termination of the transaction  and shall take such course of action as it deems appropriate 
in reviewing any related person transaction  the audit committee must consider the proposed benefits to the company  the availability of other sources of comparable products or services  an assessment of whether the proposed transaction is at least on terms comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party or to employees generally  and must then determine that the transaction is fair and reasonable to the company 
financial condition in  we reported million in net income  which is the highest in any year since our inception 
this milestone was accomplished through the increase in total revenues  the decrease in provision expense  and the reversal of the valuation allowance on our state deferred tax asset 
these increases to revenue were offset by an increase in noninterest expenses in during and  we continued to focus on improving profitability  both short term and long term  by improving asset quality  restructuring the balance sheet  increasing the net interest margin  and controlling expenses 
nonperforming asset levels continue to be higher than we would prefer  but they have declined by million since december  we are seeing improvement in several lending relationships  where they have been rehabilitated and could move to a performing status sometime in the near future 
to be able to move to performing status once a loan is considered nonperforming  certain performance levels are expected and must be sustained for a period of time 
the decrease in nonperforming assets was through improvements  charge downs or fair value adjustments  and refinancing through another institution 
total loans decreased by million and were offset by an increase in long term investments by million 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million primarily due to extremely short term deposits of approximately million being placed in the bank in december these deposits were held in cash and cash equivalents due to the short duration established for these deposits  which are expected to be withdrawn in the first quarter of without these extremely short term deposits  our total deposits would have declined by approximately million 
while asset size would have declined in and had declined in and from prior years  management anticipates that assets will begin to level out or slightly grow in the near future as we look to increase our earning assets  through the origination and purchasing of quality loans and investments while maintaining our current asset allocation 
earning assets the bank s net loans declined million  or  during total loans were million at december  compared to million at december  the loan portfolio  which equaled and of earning assets at december  and  respectively  was primarily comprised of commercial and commercial real estate loans at both dates and were made to business interests generally located within the bank s market area 
approximately of the loan portfolio at december  consisted of general commercial and industrial loans primarily secured by inventory  receivables  and equipment  while of the loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans primarily secured by real estate 
the largest concentrations of credit within the commercial and commercial real estate categories are represented by owner occupied and investment real estate at million  or of total loans  and commercial not associated with real estate at million  or of total loans 
while the general portfolio mix has remained about the same  the main direction the bank has taken was to put more resources into the commercial versus the commercial real estate product 
the concentration and growth in commercial credits is in keeping with the bank s strategy of focusing a substantial amount of efforts on commercial banking 
business banking is an area of expertise for the bank s management and lending team

these guidelines include procedures for loan review and to elicit the identification of problem loans as early as practical in order to provide effective loan portfolio administration 
we strive  through application of our credit policies and procedures  to minimize the risks and uncertainties inherent in lending 
in following these policies and procedures  we must rely on estimates  appraisals and evaluation of loans and the possibility that changes could occur because of changing general economic conditions and changes in consumer preferences  government monetary policies  changes in a borrower s financial condition  and other factors that can affect a loan s collectability 
identified problem loans  which exhibit characteristics financial or otherwise that could cause the loans to become nonperforming or require restructuring in the future  are included on an internal watch list 
senior management reviews this list regularly and adjusts for changing conditions 
at december   there were million  a decrease of million or from  of potential problem loans outstanding on the watch list 
at december   there were million of potential problem loans outstanding on the watch list 
this decrease in loans on the watch list is a reflection of management s focus on improving asset quality 
over the past few years  we have been prudent in recognizing and reporting loans in trouble and helping them return to a performing status 
nonperforming loans at december  were million  of which million were loans placed on nonaccrual status  million of loans still accruing at days or more past due  and million of troubled debt restructured loans 
the primary reason for the decrease in nonperforming loans was management s focus on improving asset quality and profitability 
the reduction was the result of loan sales  charge offs  upgrades in rating  and refinancing through another institution 
in the nonaccrual category  one commercial real estate loan in the amount of million was refinanced through another institution and one commercial real estate loan and a commercial loan in the amount of million was sold 
charge offs on these two loans totaled  of which  was previously reserved at december  nonperforming troubled debt restructurings decreased by million due to the three relationships labeled as nonperforming in the amount of million at december  moved to performing troubled debt restructuring status during based on the receipt of timely payments for more than six months on the new structure 
two new relationships were added in the amount of million during total impaired loans were million  which included most of the nonperforming loans plus loans deemed impaired and still accruing of million 
nonperforming loans at december  were million  of which million were loans placed on nonaccrual status  million of loans still accruing at days or more past due  and million of troubled debt restructured loans

of the charge offs recorded in  commercial real estate loans made up million  or  of total charge offs and commercial loans made up million  or  of total charge offs 
offsetting the charge offs was a recovery on a commercial unsecured loan in the amount of  in the remaining net charge offs were less than  each 
of the loans charged off in  million came from commercial loans and one commercial real estate loan that had been either partially or fully reserved previously 
there was one residential real estate loan from a pool of loans purchased in from countrywide  now serviced by bank of america  that had a  charge off  but only had a small reserve based on asc guidelines 
the remaining net charge offs were less than  each 
offsetting the charge offs were  of recoveries  which included a recovery of  on one commercial loan relationship that was charged off earlier in the year 
of the loans charged off in  million in charge offs were for three commercial real estate loan relationships and five commercial loan relationships 
there were other smaller charge offs but none in excess of  while all others were less than that 
the charge offs were offset by  of recoveries from two commercial loan relationships  one of which was related to the charge offs reported earlier in activity in the allowance for loan losses during     and was as follows beginning balance  january provision charged to operating expense charge offs commercial commercial real estate residential real estate home equity consumer total charge offs recoveries commercial commercial real estate residential real estate home equity consumer total recoveries total net charge offs ending balance  december in each quarter  we adjust the allowance for loan losses to the amount we believe is necessary to maintain the allowance at adequate levels 
we allocate specific portions of the allowance for loan losses to specifically identified problem loans 
our evaluation of the allowance is further based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers  industry concentrations within the portfolio and general economic conditions 
we believe that the present allowance is adequate  based on the foregoing broad range of considerations

additionally  banking regulators can require an increase to the allowance for loan losses if they deem necessary to satisfy regulatory safety and soundness concerns

during and  the size of the portfolio increased by approximately and  respectively  to focus on improving liquidity and flexibility 
the portfolio will continue to include some short term liquid holdings from time to time based on liquidity needs 
since the inception of the company  all securities have been designated as available for sale and held to maturity as defined by accounting standards 
securities designated as available for sale are stated at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of income tax  reported as a separate component of stockholders equity

trust preferred securities the company owns a million original investment in pretsl xxv out of a pooled million investment at the time of purchase 
this is the company s only pooled trust preferred security and it was classified as a collateralized debt obligation 
at march   the company took an additional otti charge to write off the remaining investment 
at december   the fair value of the investment was  and the amortized cost was  the investment was rated c by moody s and c by fitch at december  and was rated ca by moody s and c by fitch at december  the investment is divided into seven tranches 
tower s investment is in the fifth tranche c  meaning the cash flows on the investment are subordinated to the higher placed tranches 
there are sixty eight issuing participants in pretsl xxv 
fifty eight of the issuers are banks or bank holding companies  with the remaining issuers being insurance companies 
as of december   the amount of deferrals and defaults was million  or of the total pool 
of the total million of original collateral  million is currently paying interest 
the company used the otti evaluation model to analyze the present value of expected cash flows 
the otti model considered the structure and term of the collateralized debt obligation cdo and the financial condition of the underlying issuers 
we evaluated the credit quality of each underlying issuer in the pool and applied a risk rating for each issuer and then put this risk rating into a relevant risk model to identify immediate default risk 
upon completion of the analysis at march   our model indicated that the security was other than temporarily impaired 
an otti charge was recorded in the first quarter of in the amount of  which resulted in an ending book value of this security cannot experience any additional otti charges 
private label collateralized mortgage obligation the company owns a private label collateralized mortgage obligation cmo with an original investment of million  which is classified as a residential mortgage backed security 
at december   the fair value of the investment was  and the amortized cost was  the investment was rated caa by moody s and ccc by s p 
at december   the fair value of the investment was  and the amortized cost was  this bond is classified as a super senior tranche because its cash flow is not subordinated to any other tranche in the deal and is classified as a mortgage backed security residential 
we used the intex database to evaluate and model each individual loan in the underlying collateral of this security 
in  we noticed that the credit quality of the underlying collateral was marginally deteriorating causing us to more aggressively monitor and analyze for other than temporary impairment 
to monitor this investment  management has evaluated loan delinquencies  foreclosures  other real estate owned oreo and bankruptcies as a percentage of principal remaining on the loans as shown in the table below prior to making assumptions on the performing loans 
december september june march december delinquency delinquency other real estate owned foreclosure bankruptcy we utilized intex data to determine the default assumptions for all loans that are classified as past due  oreo or in foreclosure 
a severity rate was assumed on all defaults 
this number was derived from the pool average over the last months 
the default rate differs for each state based on the severity of that state s home price depreciation and the number of days the loan is past due 
any foreclosure or loan classified as other real estate owned is immediately liquidated at a severity 
the current loan category is stratified by fico scores and the level of asset documentation full documentation  low documentation  or no documentation 
the loan performance database driven by intex data is mined for historical probabilities of loans meeting these characteristics moving into default 
this was done for loans originated in   and periods 
the average default rate is then calculated  as well as its standard deviation 
two standard deviations are then added to this mean to derive the current loan cdr assumptions  representing what management feels is a stressed scenario 
we used the yield at the time of purchase as the discount rate for the cash flow analysis 
at the time of purchase the bond was yielding 
therefore  all cash flows in the otti analysis were discounted by to get a present value 
to determine the fair value  we surveyed two bond desks to see what yield it would take to sell the bond in the open market 
both desks said it would take a yield of to get someone to buy this bond 
management decided to use the conservative figure and discounted the cash flows by 
the two bond desks that were surveyed are sterne agee and performance trust 
based on the analysis performed using the assumptions above  we have determined that this private label cmo is other than temporarily impaired requiring us to record total credit impairment of  through december  an otti charge of   and  was recorded for the years ending december    and  respectively 
short term investments and fed funds sold federal funds sold  consisting of excess funds sold overnight to correspondent banks  and short term investments and interest bearing deposits  consisting of certificates of deposit with maturities less than days and interest bearing accounts at correspondent banks  are used to manage daily liquidity needs and interest rate sensitivity 
together  these short term assets  which recorded an increase of million during  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  these short term assets were approximately of earning assets 
source of funds our major source of funds is from core deposits of local businesses  governmental and municipal public fund entities  and consumers within our market area 
we also generate certificates of deposit through national out of market sources outside allen and surrounding counties 
we generate these out of market deposits through negotiated transactions with brokers 
total deposits were million at december  and million at december   an increase of million  or 
at december  total deposits were million 
noninterest bearing deposits totaled million at december   a million  or  increase from million at december  at december   noninterest bearing deposits were approximately of total deposits  an increase from the level of 
the increase in noninterest bearing deposits is temporary and is based primarily on approximately million of extremely short term deposits from two customers and approximately million from creating a holding place during the transfer of interest bearing accounts to a new product 
per the agreement with our customer for the transition to the new accounts  it is stated that the funds would be placed in a noninterest bearing account during the interim period of a few days  which happened to include the last day of the reporting year 
these funds will be moved to interest bearing accounts in january  but will not be withdrawn from the bank 
we expect the million of extremely short term deposits to be withdrawn from the bank during the first quarter of this is not expected to cause liquidity issues  as the funds are currently being held in cash and cash equivalents 
noninterest bearing deposits at december  were comprised of million in business checking accounts   in public funds  and million in consumer accounts 
interest bearing deposits decreased by million  or  during and ended at million compared to million at december  as mentioned above  approximately million of the decrease in this category was due to the transfer of funds to noninterest bearing  so that a new product can be created internally to be able to offer our customers sweep accounts 
these funds are expected to be returned to this category in january interest bearing deposits at december  were comprised of approximately in money market accounts  in interest bearing checking and savings accounts  and in certificates of deposit 
the december  percentages reflect a modest change in the deposit mix from  when the percentages were   and  respectively 
interest bearing checking accounts reported a million increase from primarily due to the increase in health savings accounts 
health savings accounts continue to be a high growth  low cost product for us which is reflected by increases in balances of million from to and million from to as of december   we had over  active health savings accounts and we expect to receive another large deposit of approximately million in january into these accounts when our customers make their employer contributions 
money market accounts reported a decline of million  of which million was due to the internal transfer of funds to noninterest bearing at the end of december the funds will not be moved back to money market accounts  but rather to an interest bearing checking account 
certificate of deposits less than  decreased million and certificate of deposits greater than  decreased by million 
throughout  we decreased our interest rates on several products to reduce our cost of funds  encourage the retention of true customers  and shift our mix from certificate of deposits to lower cost products 
brokered deposits decreased by million and were only purchased to replace other brokered deposits as they matured or were called in the brokered deposit purchases over the last two years have been structured to take advantage of the favorable rate environment to lock in low rates for an extended period of time 
the average rate on our brokered cd purchases at december  was we had no short term borrowings at december  or december  we did have borrowings in the amount of million in fhlb bullet advances at december  compared to million in fhlb bullet advances at december  the increase in fhlb borrowings during was primarily due to taking advantage of low rates as funding was needed 
we had million of aggregate principal amount in junior subordinated debenture outstanding at december  and we currently have two statutory trust subsidiaries 
tct effected a private placement of million in trust preferred securities on december  tct effected a private placement of million on december  the proceeds were loaned to us in exchange for junior subordinated debentures with similar terms to the trust preferred securities 
these securities are considered tier i capital with certain limitations applicable under current regulatory guidelines 
the junior subordinated debentures are subject to mandatory redemption  in whole or in part  upon repayment of the trust preferred securities at maturity or their earlier redemption at the par amount 
the maturity date of the trust preferred securities issued by tct is december  subject to our having received prior approval of the federal reserve bank  if then required  the trust preferred securities became redeemable prior to the maturity date as of december  and each year thereafter at our option 
at december   the interest rate on tct moved to a floating rate of three month libor plus basis points  or as of december   as we chose not redeem it at that point 
the maturity date of the trust preferred securities issued by tct is december  subject to our having received prior approval of the federal reserve bank  if then required  the trust preferred securities are redeemable prior to the maturity date beginning march  and each year thereafter at our option 
at march   the interest rate on tct will move to a floating rate of three month libor plus basis points  unless we choose to redeem it at that point  which is not expected as of december  in january  at the request of our regulators  our board of directors adopted a resolution requiring that we seek written approval from the federal reserve prior to incurring any additional parent company debt  including the addition of trust preferred securities and advances on any existing lines of credit 
in january  our board of directors adopted a resolution that supersedes the one from january that states the company will refrain from making interest payments of interest on existing trust preferred securities without first obtaining written approval from the federal reserve bank 
per the debenture agreements  we have the ability to defer payment of the interest for twenty consecutive quarters 
during  we sent the written notice each quarter beginning with the first quarter of to the trustees of the trust preferred securities stating that we elected to defer payment of the interest 
while no payments of interest were made in or  we continued to accrue the payments for each quarter 
this is the primary reason for the increase in the accrued interest payable of  from to the amount of interest accrued to bring this debt current at december  was million 
in may  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of outstanding common stock 
by december   all  approved shares were repurchased at an average price of 
our board also adopted a resolution requiring that we seek approval from the federal reserve prior to repurchasing any further shares in an amount exceeding  other than those shares covered by the may repurchase plan 
this resolution was also at the request of our regulators

no dividends were paid on preferred stock in or on may   we entered into a written agreement with the federal reserve and the idfi  effective april  the written agreement 
the written agreement does not contain any requirements to increase capital over and above the bank s current well capitalized status and does not impose any other capital ratio requirements 
among other things  the written agreement requires that the company will not pay dividends or redeem any preferred or common stock or other capital stock  or make interest payments on its trust preferred debt  without written approval from the federal reserve 
in  we complied with the written agreement and made no dividends on common or preferred stock and we elected to defer our interest payments on our trust preferred debt

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk analysis our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
all of the company s transactions are denominated in us dollars with no specific foreign exchange exposure 
the company has no agricultural related loan assets and therefore has no significant exposure to changes in commodity prices 
any impact that changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices would have on interest rates is assumed to be insignificant 
interest rate risk is the exposure of our financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates 
we derive our income primarily from the excess of interest collected on our interest earning assets over the interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
the rates of interest we earn on our assets and owe on our liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
since market interest rates change over time  we are exposed to lower profitability if we cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
accepting interest rate risk can be an important source of profitability and stockholder value  however  excessive levels of interest rate risk could pose a significant threat to our earnings and capital base 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our safety and soundness 
evaluating the exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process used to control interest rate risk and the quantitative level of exposure 
our interest rate risk management process seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity 
in evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk  we assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on our financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity and overall asset quality 
there are two interest rate risk measurement techniques that we may use 
the first  which is commonly referred to as gap analysis  measures the difference between the dollar amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced or re priced during a given time period 
a significant re pricing gap could result in a negative impact to our net interest margin during periods of changing market interest rates 
the following table describes our position as of december  rate sensitivity analysis within three to one to after three twelve five five in thousands months months years years total assets federal funds sold  short term investments and interest earning deposits securities available for sale fhlbi and frb stock loans held for sale fixed rate loans variable rate loans allowance for loan losses other assets total assets liabilities interest bearing checking savings accounts money market accounts time deposits  time deposits  and over brokered deposit money market brokered deposit certificate of deposit short term borrowings fhlb advances junior subordinated debt noninterest bearing checking other liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total sources of funds net asset liability gap cumulative gap percent of cumulative gap to total assets a second interest rate risk measurement used is commonly referred to as net interest income simulation analysis 
a simulation model assesses the direction and magnitude of variations in net interest income resulting from potential changes in market interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on various loan and investment assets  cash flows and maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  and changes in market conditions impacting loan and deposit volume and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment  therefore  a model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or exactly predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and our strategies  among other factors 
as growth has dictated  we began utilizing simulation analysis as a tool for measuring the effects of interest rate risk on the income statement at the end of in addition to changes in interest rates  the level of future net interest income is also dependent on a number of other variables  including the growth  composition and absolute levels of loans  deposits  and other earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  economic and competitive conditions  potential changes in lending  investing  and deposit gathering strategies  client preferences  and other factors 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are rate sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  it does not provide when these items may actually re price 
for loans receivable  securities  and liabilities with contractual maturities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturities as well as our historical experience of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities 
for core deposits demand deposits  interest bearing checking  savings  and money market deposits that have no contractual maturity  the table presents principal cash flows and  as applicable related weighted average interest rates based upon our historical experience  and management s judgment as applicable  concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors
