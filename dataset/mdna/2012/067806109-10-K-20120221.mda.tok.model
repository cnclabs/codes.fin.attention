other matters inflation inflation generally affects the company through its costs of labor  equipment and raw materials 
increases in the costs of these items have historically been offset by price increases  commodity price escalator provisions  operating improvements  and other cost saving initiatives 
the company has periodically experienced inflation in raw material prices 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
loss provisions  if any  on aerospace contracts are established when estimable 
loss provisions are based on the projected excess of manufacturing costs over the net revenues of the products or group of related products under contract 
the company carries a certain amount of inventory which is industry specific including spare parts for the aerospace market 
the process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory often requires the company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future adjustments to these provisions 
business acquisitions and goodwill assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
at december   the company had million of goodwill  representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or earlier if an 
table of contents event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit may have been reduced below its carrying value 
management completes its annual impairment assessment during the second quarter of each year 
the assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units 
the company has determined that its reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information reviewed by segment management one level below the operating segment level and which are aggregated when those components have similar economic characteristics 
management estimates the fair value of each reporting unit primarily using the income approach  which reflects management s cash flow projections  and also evaluates the fair value using a market approach 
these methodologies used in the current year are consistent with those used in the prior year 
management believes the cash flow projections utilized and or market multiples are reasonable and consistent with the expectations of market participants 
inherent in management s development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates  including those related to future earnings and growth and the weighted average cost of capital 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods as a result of both company specific and overall economic conditions 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in the global economy and local economies  industries and markets in which the company sells products or services  and the execution of management s plans 
there can be no assurance that future events will not result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
in the second quarter of  management performed its annual impairment testing based on the information available as of the date of the assessment 
based on this assessment  there was no goodwill impairment in and the fair values of each of the company s reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values 
in the fourth quarter of  the company s board of directors approved the sale of the bde business 
upon approval  the bde business was classified as held for sale

revenue sharing programs the company participates in aftermarket rsps under which the company receives an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program 
as consideration  the company has paid participation fees  which are recorded as long lived intangible assets  and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated useful life of the related engine programs which range up to years 
the company records amortization of the related long lived intangible asset as sales dollars are being earned based on a proportional sales dollar method 
specifically  this method amortizes each intangible asset as a reduction to revenue based on the proportion of sales under a program in a given period to the estimated aggregate sales dollars over the life of that program 
this method reflects the pattern in which economic benefits are realized 
the recoverability of each intangible asset is subject to significant estimates about future revenues related to the program s aftermarket parts 
the company evaluates these intangible assets for impairment and updates amortization rates on an agreement by agreement basis 
the intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
annually  the company evaluates the remaining useful life of these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
management updates revenue projections  which includes comparing actual experience against projected revenue and industry projections 
the potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions 
a shortfall in future revenues may indicate a triggering event requiring an impairment test of the intangible asset or require the company to accelerate amortization expense prospectively dependent on the level of the shortfall 
the company has not identified any impairment of these intangible assets

the following table provides a breakout of the current targeted mix of investments  by asset classification  along with the historical rates of return for each asset class and the long term projected rates of return for the us plans 

table of contents target asset mix annual return historical long term projection asset class large cap growth large cap value mid cap equity small cap growth small cap value non us equity real estate related fixed income cash weighted average historical returns based on the life of the respective index  approximately years 
the historical rates of return were calculated based upon compounded average rates of return of published indices 
the aggregate target for fixed income and cash investments in aggregate is lower than the fixed income and cash component of a typical pension trust 
the fixed income investments include a higher than average component of yield aggressive investments  including high yield corporate bonds 
based on the overall historical and projected rates of return of the targeted asset mix  management is using the long term rate of return on its us pension assets of 
the long term rates of return for non us plans were selected based on actual historical rates of return of published indices that were used to measure the plans target asset allocations 
historical rates were then discounted to consider fluctuations in the historical rates as well as potential changes in the investment environment 
the discount rate used for the company s us pension plans reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
at december   the company selected a discount rate of based on a bond matching model for its us pension plans 
the discount rates for non us plans were selected based on bond matching models or on indices of high quality bonds using criteria applicable to the respective countries 
a one quarter percentage point change in the assumed long term rate of return on the company s us pension plans as of december  would impact the company s pre tax income by approximately million annually 
a one quarter percentage point decrease in the discount rate on the company s us pension plans as of december  would decrease the company s pre tax income by approximately million annually 
the company reviews these and other assumptions at least annually 
during  the fair value of the company s pension plan assets decreased by million and the projected benefit obligation increased million due primarily to changes in actuarial assumptions 
approximately million of the pension plan asset decrease  as well as a net reduction to the projected benefit obligation of million  relates to the transfer of pension plan assets and liabilities that occurred in conjunction with the sale of the bde business 
the company s pension expense for was million 
this expense includes a million curtailment gain and a million settlement loss related to the sale of the bde business  in addition to million of pension expense related to the bde business 
the pension expense  excluding the bde business  would have approximated million 
pension expense for is expected to increase to approximately million primarily as a result of an increase in the amortization of actuarial losses from previous asset performance and changes in certain actuarial assumptions  primarily a lower discount rate 
the expense estimate does not include potential future settlement costs 
income taxes as of december   the company had recognized million of deferred tax assets  net of valuation reserves  principally in the united states 
the realization of these benefits is dependent in part on the amount and timing of future taxable income in the jurisdictions where deferred tax assets reside 
for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax loss carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is provided 
management believes that sufficient taxable income should be earned in the future to realize deferred income tax assets  net of valuation allowances recorded 
the united states deferred tax assets include significant tax operating loss carryforwards 
if it became more likely than 
table of contents not that the deferred tax assets would expire unused  the company would record a valuation allowance to reflect this fact 
the company is not in a cumulative loss position in the us over the last three years defined as pre tax book income plus permanent tax items and does not currently project to be in a cumulative loss position through the valuation of deferred tax assets requires significant judgment 
management s assessment that these deferred tax assets will be realized represents its estimate of future results  however  there can be no assurance that such expectations will be met 
changes in management s assessment of achieving sufficient future taxable income could materially increase the company s tax expense and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance in the future 
additionally  the company is exposed to certain tax contingencies in the ordinary course of business and  accordingly  records those tax liabilities in accordance with the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized 
for those income tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the company s financial results could be impacted by changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity price changes 
the company uses financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s long term debt portfolio consists of fixed rate and variable rate instruments and is managed to reduce the overall cost of borrowing while also minimizing the effect of changes in interest rates on near term earnings 
the company s primary interest rate risk is derived from its outstanding variable rate debt obligations 
financial instruments have been used by the company to hedge its exposures to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company previously had two  three year interest rate swap agreements which together converted the interest on the first million of the company s one month libor based borrowings from a variable rate plus the borrowing spread to a fixed rate of plus the borrowing spread and were accounted for as cash flow hedges 
these agreements matured in the first quarter of at december   the result of a hypothetical basis point increase in the average cost of the company s variable rate debt would have reduced annual pretax profit by million 
at december   the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt was million  compared with its carrying amount of million 
the company estimates that a basis point decrease in market interest rates at december  would have increased the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt to million 
the company has manufacturing  sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus makes investments and conducts business transactions denominated in various currencies 
the currencies of the locations where the company s business operations are conducted include the us dollar  brazilian real  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  chinese yuan  euro  korean won  mexican peso  singapore dollar  swedish krona  swiss franc and thai baht 
the company is exposed primarily to financial instruments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency at its international locations 
a adverse change in all currencies at december  would have resulted in a million loss in the fair value of those financial instruments 
at december   the company held million of cash and cash equivalents and million million of restricted cash held in escrow  substantially all of which is held by foreign subsidiaries 
this includes cash proceeds from the sale of the bde business that was received on december   the majority of which was not in the local functional currency or hedged at december  in january  to reduce the foreign currency exposure  the company either converted cash to the functional currency or entered into forward currency contracts 
the majority of the unhedged cash balances are held in foreign subsidiaries that have the us dollar as the functional currency 
foreign currency commitments and transaction exposures are managed at the operating units as an integral part of their businesses in accordance with a corporate policy that addresses acceptable levels of foreign currency exposures 
at december   the company did not hedge its foreign currency net investment exposures 
additionally  to reduce foreign currency exposure  management generally maintains the majority of foreign cash and short term investments in functional currency and uses forward currency contracts for non functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions in an effort to reduce the effect of the volatility of changes in foreign exchange rates on the income statement 
in historically weaker currency countries  such as brazil and mexico  management assesses the strength of these currencies relative to the us dollar and may elect during periods of local currency weakness to invest excess cash in us dollar denominated instruments 
the company s exposure to commodity price changes relates to certain manufacturing operations that utilize high grade steel spring wire  titanium and other specialty metals and the distribution operations which distribute products made of steel  copper and brass 
the company attempts to manage its exposure to increases in those prices through its procurement and sales practices
