forward looking statements include statements regarding the intent  belief or current expectations of our management team  as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based 
any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions  the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time 
important factors currently known to management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties associated with economic conditions in the commercial interiors industry as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed in item a  risk factors 
item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following factors  in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k and the other documents incorporated herein by reference  before deciding whether to purchase or sell our common stock 
any or all of the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
general business risks the ongoing worldwide financial and credit crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the ongoing worldwide financial and credit crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of many business operations worldwide 
this shortage of liquidity and credit  combined with recent substantial losses in worldwide equity markets  could lead to an extended worldwide economic recession and result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  the limited availability of credit and liquidity adversely affects the ability of customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations 
consequently  customers may defer  delay or cancel renovation and construction projects where our carpet is used  resulting in decreased orders and sales for us  and they also may not be able to pay us for those products and services we already have provided to them 
for the same reasons  suppliers may not be able to produce and deliver raw materials and other goods and services that we have ordered from them  thus disrupting our own manufacturing operations 
in addition  our ability to obtain funding from capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to access those markets 
this inability to obtain that funding could prevent us from pursuing important strategic growth plans  from reacting to changing economic and business conditions  and from refinancing existing debt which in turn could lead to a default on our debt 
the financial and credit crisis also could have an impact on the lenders under our credit facilities  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to provide us with loans and letters of credit  which are important sources of liquidity for us 
our domestic revolving credit facility matures in june we cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate or refinance this debt on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  especially given the ongoing worldwide financial and credit crisis 
sales of our principal products have been and may continue to be affected by adverse economic cycles in the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings 
sales of our principal products are related to the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings 
this activity is cyclical and has been affected by the strength of a country s or region s general economy  prevailing interest rates and other factors that lead to cost control measures by businesses and other users of commercial or institutional space 
the effects of cyclicality upon the corporate office segment tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the institutional segment 
historically  we have generated more sales in the corporate office segment than in any other market 
the effects of cyclicality upon the new construction segment of the market also tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the renovation segment 
these effects may recur and could be more pronounced if global economic conditions do not improve or are further weakened 
we compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive commercial floorcovering products market  and some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do 
the commercial floorcovering industry is highly competitive 
globally  we compete for sales of floorcovering products with other carpet manufacturers and manufacturers of other types of floorcovering 
although the industry has experienced significant consolidation  a large number of manufacturers remain in the industry 
some of our competitors  including a number of large diversified domestic and foreign companies who manufacture modular carpet as one segment of their business  have greater financial resources than we do 
our success depends significantly upon the efforts  abilities and continued service of our senior management executives and our principal design consultant  and our loss of any of them could affect us adversely 
we believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management executives 
in addition  we rely significantly on the leadership that david oakey of david oakey designs provides to our internal design staff 
specifically  david oakey designs provides product design production engineering services to us under an exclusive consulting contract that contains non competition covenants 
our current agreement with david oakey designs extends to april the loss of any of these key persons could have an adverse impact on our business because each has a great deal of knowledge  training and experience in the carpet industry particularly in the areas of sales  marketing  operations  product design and management and could not easily or quickly be replaced 
our substantial international operations are subject to various political  economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results  including by restrictive taxation or other government regulation and by foreign currency fluctuations 
we have substantial international operations 
in  approximately half of our net sales and a significant portion of our production were outside the united states  primarily in europe and asia pacific 
our corporate strategy includes the expansion and growth of our international business on a worldwide basis 
as a result  our operations are subject to various political  economic and other uncertainties  including risks of restrictive taxation policies  changing political conditions and governmental regulations 
we also make a substantial portion of our net sales in currencies other than us dollars approximately half of net sales  which subjects us to the risks inherent in currency translations 
the scope and volume of our global operations make it impossible to eliminate completely all foreign currency translation risks as an influence on our financial results 
concerns regarding the european sovereign debt crisis and market perceptions about the instability of the euro  the potential re introduction of individual currencies within the eurozone  or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely  could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
as a result of the european sovereign debt crisis  concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain countries using the euro as their currency the eurozone and their ability to meet future financial obligations  the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries 
despite remedial efforts being taken by the european commission and others  these concerns have caused instability in the euro and could lead to the re introduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries  or  in more extreme circumstances  the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely 
should the euro dissolve entirely  the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time 
these potential developments  or market perceptions concerning these and related issues  could adversely affect the value of our euro denominated assets and obligations or increase the risks of foreign currency fluctuations or cause the failure of hedging programs intended to reduce those risks 
in addition  concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse impact on the capital markets generally  and more specifically on our ability and the ability of our customers  suppliers and lenders to finance our and their respective businesses  to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs  if at all  on the availability of supplies and materials  and on the demand for our products 
large increases in the cost of petroleum based raw materials could adversely affect us if we are unable to pass these cost increases through to our customers 
petroleum based products comprise the predominant portion of the cost of raw materials that we use in manufacturing 
while we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding price increases  continued volatility in the cost of petroleum based raw materials could adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass through such price increases to our customers 
unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third party suppliers of synthetic fiber could have a material adverse effect on us 
the unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our supply arrangements with our current suppliers of synthetic fiber nylon  which typically are not pursuant to long term agreements  could have a material adverse effect on us because we do not have the capability to manufacture our own fiber for use in our carpet products 
if any of our supply arrangements with our primary suppliers of synthetic fiber is terminated or interrupted  we likely would incur increased manufacturing costs and experience delays in our manufacturing process thus resulting in decreased sales and profitability associated with shifting more of our synthetic fiber purchasing to another synthetic fiber supplier 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness  which could have important negative consequences to us 
our significant indebtedness could have important negative consequences to us  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to such indebtedness  increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions or other growth initiatives  and other general corporate requirements  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions or other growth initiatives  and other general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors  and limiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures 
as a consequence of our level of indebtedness  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service requirements 
in addition  the terms of our primary revolving credit facility in the us and the indenture governing our senior notes due limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments in certain situations  consummate certain asset sales  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  create liens  merge or consolidate with any other person  or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
they also require us to comply with certain other reporting  affirmative and negative covenants and  at times  meet certain financial tests 
if we fail to satisfy these tests or comply with these covenants  a default may occur  in which case the lenders could accelerate the debt as well as any other debt to which cross acceleration or cross default provisions apply 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to renegotiate  refinance or otherwise obtain the necessary funds to satisfy these obligations 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile and the value of your investment may decline 
the market price of our class a common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile going forward 
such volatility may cause precipitous drops in the price of our class a common stock on the nasdaq global select market and may cause your investment in our common stock to lose significant value 
as a general matter  market price volatility has had a significant effect on the market values of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance 
we thus cannot predict the market price for our common stock going forward 
our earnings in a future period could be adversely affected by non cash adjustments to goodwill  if a future test of goodwill assets indicates a material impairment of those assets 
as prescribed by accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets  we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements 
our review is conducted during the fourth quarter of the year  unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment 
in the past  we have had non cash adjustments for goodwill impairment as a result of such testings million in and million in 
a future goodwill impairment test may result in a future non cash adjustment  which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period

our business  as well as the commercial interiors industry in general  is cyclical in nature and is impacted by economic conditions and trends that affect the markets for commercial and institutional business space 
the commercial interiors industry  including the market for floorcovering products  is largely driven by reinvestment by corporations into their existing businesses in the form of new fixtures and furnishings for their workplaces 
in significant part  the timing and amount of such reinvestments are impacted by the profitability of those corporations 
as a result  macroeconomic factors such as employment rates  office vacancy rates  capital spending  productivity and efficiency gains that impact corporate profitability in general  also affect our business 
during the past several years  we have successfully focused more of our marketing and sales efforts on non corporate office segments to reduce somewhat our exposure to economic cycles that affect the corporate office market segment more adversely  as well as to capture additional market share 
our mix of corporate office versus non corporate office modular carpet sales in the americas has shifted over the past several years to and  respectively  for compared with and  respectively  in company wide  our mix of corporate office versus non corporate office sales was and  respectively  in we expect a further shift in the future as we continue to implement our market diversification strategy 
from through the first half of  the commercial interiors industry experienced growth at a gradual pace  which led to improved sales and operating profitability for us during that period 
in the fourth quarter of  and particularly in november and december  the worldwide financial and credit crisis caused many corporations  governments and other organizations to delay or curtail spending on renovation and construction projects where our carpet is used 
this downturn  which continued throughout  negatively impacted our performance and led to the goodwill impairment and restructuring charges  discussed below  that we incurred in the fourth quarter of and the first half of demand levels substantially recovered in during  we had net sales of  million  compared with million in operating income for was million  compared with operating income of million in income from continuing operations in was million  or per diluted share  compared with income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  in net income attributable to interface  inc was million  or per diluted share  in  compared with net income attributable to interface  inc of million  or per diluted share  in included in our results for are million of restructuring charges  discussed below

we received million of gross proceeds from these settlements 
restructuring charges restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of  we committed to a restructuring plan intended to reduce costs across our worldwide operations and more closely align our operations with reduced demand in certain markets 
as a result of this plan  we incurred pre tax restructuring and asset impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of the majority of this charge million relates to the severance of approximately employees in europe  asia and the united states 
the remainder of the charge million relates to contract termination and fixed asset impairment costs 
approximately million of this charge will result in cash expenditures  primarily severance expenses 
actions and expense related to this plan were substantially completed by the end of we expect to generate annual savings of approximately million as a result of these restructuring charges 
restructuring plan in the first quarter of  we adopted a restructuring plan primarily related to workforce reduction in our european modular carpet operations 
this reduction was in response to the continued challenging economic climate in that region 
smaller amounts were incurred in connection with restructuring activities in the americas 
a total of approximately employees were affected by this restructuring plan 
in connection with this plan  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
substantially all of this charge involved cash expenditures  primarily severance expenses 
it is anticipated that this restructuring plan will generate annual savings of approximately million 
actions and expenses related to this plan were substantially completed in the first quarter of restructuring plan in the first quarter of  we adopted a restructuring plan  primarily comprised of a reduction in our worldwide employee base by a total of approximately employees and continuing actions taken to better align fixed costs with demand for our products on a global level 
in connection with the plan  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million  comprised of million of employee severance expense and million of other exit costs primarily costs to exit the canadian manufacturing facilities  lease exit costs and other costs 
approximately million of the restructuring charge involved cash expenditures  primarily severance expense 
in the second quarter of  we recorded an additional million restructuring charge as a continuation of this plan

discontinued operations in  we sold our fabrics group business segment to a third party 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we have reported the results of operations for the former fabrics group business segment for all periods reflected herein  as discontinued operations

for additional information on discontinued operations  see the notes entitled discontinued operations  and taxes on income in item of this report 
analysis of results of operations the following discussion and analyses reflect the factors and trends discussed in the preceding sections 
our net sales that were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar were approximately in  in  and in because we have such substantial international operations  we are impacted  from time to time  by international developments that affect foreign currency transactions 
for example  the performance of the euro against the us dollar  for purposes of the translation of european revenues into us dollars  favorably affected our reported results during  when the euro was strengthening relative to the us dollar 
during the years and  the dollar strengthened versus the euro  having the opposite effect on our reported results 
the following table presents the amount in us dollars by which the exchange rates for converting euros into us dollars have affected our net sales and operating income during the past three years september  september  september  in millions net sales operating income the following table presents  as a percentage of net sales  certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations during the past three years september  september  september  fiscal year net sales cost of sales gross profit on sales selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring and asset impairment charge income from litigation settlements operating income interest other expense bond retirement expenses income from continuing operations before tax income tax expense income from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of tax net income net income attributable to interface  inc below we provide information regarding net sales for each of our two operating segments  and analyze those results for each of the last three fiscal years 
fiscal year was a week period  while fiscal years and were week periods 
the weeks in versus the weeks in and are a factor in certain of the comparisons reflected below 
net sales by business segment we currently classify our businesses into the following two operating segments for reporting purposes modular carpet segment  which includes our interfaceflor  heuga and flor modular carpet businesses  and also includes our intersept antimicrobial chemical sales and licensing program  and bentley prince street segment  which includes our bentley prince street broadloom  modular carpet and area rug businesses 
net sales by operating segment were as follows during the past three years september  september  september  september  september  fiscal year percentage change in thousands net sales by segment compared with compared with modular carpet bentley prince street total modular carpet segment 
for  net sales for the modular carpet segment increased million versus the weighed average selling price per square yard increased approximately in versus on a geographic basis  we experienced increases in net sales in all regions for  versus  with our americas  europe and asia pacific regions experiencing sales growth of  and  respectively europe experienced sales growth in local currency 
the recovery of the corporate office market was the largest factor in this increase in sales  although smaller increases occurred in certain non office commercial market segments 
in the americas  the corporate office market segment saw an increase of during success in certain non office commercial markets also fueled the sales increase  particularly in the education up  healthcare up and retail up market segments 
sales in the residential market segment  helped by the opening of new flor stores during the year  showed an improvement of during these increases were offset somewhat by sales decreases in the government down and hospitality down market segments 
sales growth in europe was also due to the strength of the corporate office market segment up in us dollars  in local currency  as well as success in the government up in us dollars  in local currency and education up in us dollars  in local currency market segments 
these gains were somewhat offset by a decline in the residential market segment down in us dollars  in local currency in europe 
as in our other geographic areas  the increased sales in asia pacific were due to the strength of the corporate office market segment up 
asia pacific also saw increases in the healthcare up and hospitality up market segments 
these increases were partially offset by sales decreases in the education down and government down market segments 
for  net sales for the modular carpet segment increased million versus the weighted average selling price per square yard in showed a slight increase approximately versus on a geographic basis  we experienced increases in net sales in the americas  europe  and asia pacific up  and  respectively in versus the sales increase in europe in local currency was 
these increases are primarily attributable to the improving economic climates in those regions 
sales growth in the americas is due to the continued recovery in the corporate office market segment up as well the education up  hospitality up  residential up and governmental up market segments 
only one market segment retail  down showed a decline in the americas 
the sales increase in europe was led by the corporate office up in us dollars and in local currency  retail up in us dollars and in local currency and education up in us dollars and in local currency market segments 
these increases were offset somewhat by declines in the residential down in us dollars and in local currency and healthcare down in us dollars and in local currency market segments 
the asia pacific region saw sales increase across all market segments  with corporate office up and education up over showing the most significant increases 
bentley prince street segment 
for  net sales for the bentley prince street segment increased million versus the weighted average selling price per square yard increased approximately in versus as in our modular carpet segment  the corporate office market segment continues to be the driving force behind this sales increase  showing improvement of versus this increase was mitigated by sales declines in most non office commercial markets  particularly the government down and education down market segments 
in our non office segments  only the retail market segment up and the residential market segment up showed improvements during for  net sales in our bentley prince street segment increased million versus the increase was due to the strength of the corporate office market segment up as well as an increase in sales into the government market segment up 
these increases were somewhat offset by decreases in the healthcare down  hospitality down  residential down and education down market segments 
the weighted average selling price per square yard in showed an improvement of approximately due to both the improving economic climate as well as a shift towards higher priced modular carpet sold at bentley prince street 
cost and expenses company consolidated 
the following table presents  on a consolidated basis for our operations  our overall cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses during the past three years september  september  september  september  september  cost and expenses fiscal year percentage change compared with compared with in thousands cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses total for  our cost of sales increased million versus fluctuations in currency exchange rates accounted for approximately million approximately of the increase 
the primary components of this increase in cost of sales were the increases in raw materials costs approximately million and labor costs approximately million associated with higher production volumes  particularly in the first six months of  compared with in addition  our raw materials costs during were approximately higher than raw materials costs in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales increased to for  versus in this percentage increase is primarily due to the significant increase in raw materials costs we experienced during reduced absorption of fixed manufacturing costs due to lower production volumes during the fourth quarter of also negatively impacted gross profit margins as well 
for  our cost of sales increased million versus fluctuations in currency exchange rates accounted for approximately million of the increase 
the primary components of the million increase in cost of sales were increases in raw material costs approximately million and labor costs approximately million associated with higher production and sales volumes during versus our raw material prices in were approximately higher than raw material prices in as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales decreased to for  versus in the percentage decrease was primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies in both our modular carpet and bentley prince street business segments 
the improved manufacturing efficiencies are largely a result of the increase in sales volume  coupled with the full realization of our restructuring plans implemented during early for  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased million versus fluctuations in currency exchange rates accounted for approximately million of the increase 
the primary components of this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses were a million increase in selling expense  commensurate with the increase in sales as well as selected investments made in our consumer market and diversification strategies  a million increase in overall administrative costs due  in part  to increases in non cash incentive based pay during  particularly in the first six months of the year 
due to these increases  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for  versus for for  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased million versus fluctuations in currency exchange rates accounted for approximately million of the increase 
the primary components of the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses were an million increase in incentive compensation due to the attainment of performance goals in  a million increase in marketing expenses  particularly in our modular carpet segment where we continue to invest in our end market diversification strategy as well as corporate office segment marketing programs  and an million increase in selling expenses particularly in our modular carpet operations commensurate with the increase in sales volume 
these increases were somewhat mitigated  however  by a decrease of approximately million in general administrative expenses across our business  a direct result of the full year benefit of restructuring plans implemented in despite the overall increases  due to increased sales volume  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for  versus for cost and expenses by segment 
the following table presents the combined cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses for each of our operating segments during the past three years september  september  september  september  september  fiscal year percentage change cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses combined compared with compared with in thousands modular carpet bentley prince street corporate expenses total interest and other expense for interest expense decreased million versus this decrease was due to the issuance of our senior notes in the fourth quarter of  the proceeds of which we used to complete the repurchase of substantially all of our senior secured notes and our outstanding senior subordinated notes pursuant to the tender offer discussed above 
our use of the proceeds from our senior notes to retire higher interest debt led to a significant reduction in our interest expense  as compared to for  interest expense decreased by million versus  primarily due to the redemption of million of our senior subordinated notes in the first quarter of the savings from the redemption were somewhat offset by the higher interest rate paid on our senior secured notes  which were outstanding during the full year of versus only seven months outstanding in approximately million of these senior secured notes were repurchased in december 
tax our effective tax rate in was  compared with an effective rate of in this increase in effective rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies associated with the funding of our nonqualified savings plan and salary continuation plan resulting in nondeductible losses in as compared with an increase in  which resulted in nontaxable gains  a decrease in state tax benefits due to less state net operating losses in as compared with  and less of a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits in as compared with the increase in effective rate was partially offset by a decrease in valuation allowances related to state net operating loss carryforwards and a decrease in the us tax effects attributable to foreign operations related to subpart f income 
for additional information on taxes and a reconciliation of effective tax rates to statutory tax rates  see the note entitled taxes on income in item of this report 
our effective tax rate in was  compared with an effective rate of in this decrease in effective rate is primarily attributable to an effective foreign tax rate that is lower than the federal statutory rate coupled with a increase of foreign earnings from to  a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits related to a settlement of the canadian tax authorities transfer pricing reassessment for tax years and  and an increase in state tax benefits due to greater state net operating losses realized in compared to the decrease in effective rate was partially offset by an increase in valuation allowances related to state net operating loss carryforwards and an increase in the us tax effects attributable to foreign operations related to subpart f income 
for additional information on taxes and a reconciliation of effective tax rates to statutory tax rates  see the note entitled taxes on income in item of this report 
liquidity and capital resources general in our business  we require cash and other liquid assets primarily to purchase raw materials and to pay other manufacturing costs  in addition to funding normal course selling  general and administrative expenses  anticipated capital expenditures  interest expense and potential special projects 
we generate our cash and other liquidity requirements primarily from our operations and from borrowings or letters of credit under our domestic revolving credit facility with a banking syndicate 
we believe that we will be able to continue to enhance the generation of free cash flow through the following initiatives improving our inventory turns by continuing to implement a made to order model throughout our organization  reducing our average days sales outstanding through improved credit and collection practices  and limiting the amount of our capital expenditures generally to those projects that have a short term payback period 
historically  we use more cash in the first half of the fiscal year  as we fund insurance premiums  tax payments  incentive compensation and inventory build up in preparation for the holiday vacation season of our international operations 
in addition  we have a high contribution margin business with low capital expenditure requirements 
contribution margin represents variable gross profit margin less the variable component of selling  general and administrative expenses  and for us is an indicator of profit on incremental sales after the fixed components of cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses have been recovered 
while contribution margin should not be construed as a substitute for gross margin  which is determined in accordance with gaap  it is included herein to provide additional information with respect to our potential for profitability 
in addition  we believe that investors find contribution margin to be a useful tool for measuring our profitability on an operating basis 
our ability to generate cash from operating activities is somewhat uncertain because we are subject to  and in the past have experienced  fluctuations in our level of net sales 
in this regard  the worldwide financial and credit crisis that developed in the latter part of resulted in a reduction in our net sales from  million in to million in  as customers delayed or reduced the number of renovation and construction projects where our carpet products are used 
since that time  demand levels have substantially recovered 
at january   we had million in cash 
at that date  we had no borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under our domestic revolving credit facility  and no borrowings outstanding under our european credit facility 
as of january   we could have incurred million of additional borrowings under our domestic revolving credit facility and million approximately million of additional borrowings under our european credit facility 
in addition  we could have incurred the equivalent of million of borrowings under our other credit facilities in place at other non us subsidiaries 
we have approximately million in contractual cash obligations due by the end of fiscal year  which includes  among other things  pension cash contributions  interest payments on our debt and capital expenditure commitments 
based on current interest rate and debt levels  we expect our aggregate interest expense for to be between million and million 
we estimate aggregate capital expenditures in to be between million and million  although we are not committed to these amounts 
on december   we completed a private offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on june and december the first payment was made on june  
we used the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes plus cash on hand in connection with the repurchase of approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes and approximately million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes  pursuant to a tender offer we conducted 
in june  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes 
after deducting the initial purchasers discount and other fees and expenses associated with the sale  net proceeds were million 
we used million of those net proceeds to repurchase million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes pursuant to a tender offer we conducted 
included in the million used to repurchase the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes were a purchase price premium of million and accrued interest of million 
the remaining million of the net proceeds was used to repay a portion of the million of senior notes that remained outstanding following the tender offer 
the balance of the senior notes was then repaid at maturity on february  it is important for you to consider that we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
our outstanding million of senior secured notes mature in november  our outstanding million of senior subordinated notes mature in february  our domestic revolving credit facility matures in june  and our outstanding million of senior notes mature in we cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate or refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to refinance our debt or obtain new financing  we would have to consider other options  such as selling assets to meet our debt service obligations and other liquidity needs  or using cash  if available  that would have been used for other business purposes 
domestic revolving credit facility we have a domestic revolving credit facility that provides for a maximum aggregate amount of loans and letters of credit of up to million with the option to increase it to a maximum of million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions at any one time  subject to the borrowing base described below 
the key features of the domestic revolving credit facility are as follows the revolving credit facility currently matures on june   the revolving credit facility includes a domestic us dollar syndicated loan and letter of credit facility made available to interface  inc up to the lesser of million  or a borrowing base equal to the sum of specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory in the united states the percentages and eligibility requirements for the borrowing base are specified in the credit facility  less certain reserves  advances under the facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of interface  inc s assets and the assets of each of its material domestic subsidiaries  which have guaranteed the revolving credit facility  and the revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant a fixed charge coverage ratio test that becomes effective in the event that our excess borrowing availability falls below of the aggregate loan commitments of the lenders

interest rates and fees 
interest on base rate loans is charged at varying rates computed by applying a margin ranging from to over the applicable base interest rate which is defined as the greatest of the prime rate  a specified federal funds rate plus  or the one month libor rate  depending on our average excess borrowing availability during the most recently completed fiscal quarter 
interest on libor based loans and fees for letters of credit are charged at varying rates computed by applying a margin ranging from to over the applicable libor rate  depending on our average excess borrowing availability during the most recently completed fiscal quarter 
in addition  we pay an unused line fee of per annum on the facility

foreign credit facilities our european subsidiary interface europe bv and certain of interface europe bv s subsidiaries have a credit agreement with the royal bank of scotland as successor to abn amro bank nv rbs 
under the credit agreement  rbs provides a credit facility  until further notice  for borrowings and bank guarantees of million

the facility also includes certain financial covenants which require the borrowers and their subsidiaries to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio  total debt ebitda ratio and tangible net worth total assets and affirmative and negative covenants  and other provisions that restrict the borrowers ability and the ability of certain of the borrowers subsidiaries to take certain actions 
as of january   there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
some of our other non us subsidiaries have an aggregate of the equivalent of million of lines of credit available 
as of january   there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit 
we are presently in compliance with all covenants under these foreign credit facilities and anticipate that we will remain in compliance with the covenants for the foreseeable future 
senior and senior subordinated notes as of january   we had outstanding million of our senior notes  million of our senior subordinated notes  and million of our senior secured notes 
the indentures governing these notes  on a collective basis  contain covenants that limit or restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make dividend payments or other restricted payments  create liens on our assets  sell our assets  sell securities of our subsidiaries  enter into transactions with shareholders and affiliates  and enter into mergers  consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  the indentures governing each series of notes contains a covenant that requires us to make an offer to purchase the outstanding notes under such indenture in the event of a change of control of interface  inc as defined in each respective indenture 
each series of notes is guaranteed  fully  unconditionally  and jointly and severally  on an unsecured basis by each of our material us subsidiaries 
in addition  the senior secured notes but not the senior notes or senior subordinated notes are secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of our and certain of our domestic subsidiaries assets that secure our domestic revolving credit facility discussed above on a first priority basis 
if we breach or fail to perform any of the affirmative or negative covenants under one of these indentures  or if other specified events occur such as a bankruptcy or similar event  after giving effect to any applicable notice and right to cure provisions  an event of default will exist

if an event of default exists and is continuing  the trustee of the notes or the holders of at least of the principal amount of such notes may declare the principal amount of the notes and accrued interest thereon immediately due and payable except in the case of bankruptcy  in which case such amounts are immediately due and payable even in the absence of such a declaration 
also  the collateral agent for the senior secured notes may subject to the rights of the first priority lien holders under the domestic revolving credit facility exercise remedies with respect to the collateral securing those notes 
analysis of cash flows our primary sources of cash during were million of cash received as a result of exercises of employee stock options  and million received due to a reduction of prepaid expenses 
our primary uses of cash during were million for capital expenditures  million due to increased inventory levels  and million due to decreases in accounts payable and accruals 
our primary sources of cash during were million of gross proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes  million due to an increase of accounts payable and accrued expenses  and million from the exercise of employee stock options 
our primary uses of cash during were million used to repurchase a portion of our senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes  million for premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of these senior and senior subordinated notes  million for capital expenditures  and million due to an increase in inventory 
our primary sources of cash during were million from the issuance of our million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes  million from a reduction of accounts receivable  million from a reduction of inventory  and million from settlements of litigation 
the primary uses of cash during were million used to repurchase a portion of our senior notes  million as a reduction in accounts payable and accruals  million for capital expenditures  million for debt issuance costs in connection with the senior secured notes  and million for premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of our senior notes 
we believe that our liquidity position will provide sufficient funds to meet our current commitments and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
funding obligations we have various contractual obligations that we must fund as part of our normal operations 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations including the remaining contractual obligations related to our discontinued operations and the periods in which payments are due 
the amounts and time periods are measured from january  september  september  september  september  september  payments due by period total payments due less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations expected interest payments unconditional purchase obligations pension cash obligations total contractual cash obligations our capital lease obligations are insignificant 
expected interest payments to be made in future periods reflect anticipated interest payments related to the million of our senior notes  million of outstanding senior secured notes  and the million of our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
we have also assumed in the presentation above that these notes will remain outstanding until maturity 
we have excluded from the presentation interest payments and fees related to our revolving credit facilities discussed above  because of the variability and timing of advances and repayments thereunder 
unconditional purchase obligations do not include unconditional purchase obligations that are included as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
our capital expenditure commitments are not significant 
we have two foreign defined benefit plans and a domestic salary continuation plan 
we have presented above the estimated cash obligations that will be paid under these plans over the next ten years 
such amounts are based on several estimates and assumptions and could differ materially should the underlying estimates and assumptions change 
our domestic salary continuation plan is an unfunded plan  and we do not currently have any commitments to make contributions to this plan 
however  we do use insurance instruments to hedge our exposure under the salary continuation plan 
contributions to our other employee benefit plans are at our discretion 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million  the timing of which payments are uncertain 
see the note entitled taxes on income in item of this report for further information 
critical accounting policies the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimations about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events may not develop as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership  which is generally on the date of shipment 
provisions for discounts  sales returns and allowances are estimated using historical experience  current economic trends  and the company s quality performance 
the related provision is recorded as a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the same period that the revenue is recognized 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of net sales for any period if management makes different judgments or uses different estimates 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
shipping and handling costs incurred are classified in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment at the asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment is indicated 
a loss is then recognized for the difference  if any  between the fair value of the asset as estimated by management using its best judgment and the carrying value of the asset 
if actual market value is less favorable than that estimated by management  additional write downs may be required 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies in accordance with applicable accounting standards  and are based on management s assumptions and estimates regarding future operating results and levels of taxable income  as well as management s judgment regarding the interpretation of the provisions of applicable accounting standards 
the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable are based on management s interpretations of applicable tax laws  and incorporate management s assumptions and judgments regarding the use of tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in connection with accounting for income taxes may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and results of operations 
we evaluate the recoverability of these deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates 
we use our historical experience and our short and long term business forecasts to provide insight 
further  our global business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions 
to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered  a valuation allowance is established 
as of january   and january   we had approximately million and million of us federal net operating loss carryforwards  respectively 
in addition  as of january  and january   we had state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
certain of these carryforwards are reserved with a valuation allowance because  based on the available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize those deferred tax assets in the future 
the remaining year end amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods 
if the actual amounts of taxable income differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
goodwill 
pursuant to applicable accounting standards  we test goodwill for impairment at least annually using a two step approach 
in the first step of this approach  we prepare valuations of reporting units  using both a market comparable approach and an income approach  and those valuations are compared with the respective book values of the reporting units to determine whether any goodwill impairment exists 
in preparing the valuations  past  present and expected future performance is considered 
if impairment is indicated in this first step of the test  a step two valuation approach is performed 
the step two valuation approach compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the book value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets  in the same manner as goodwill is determined in a business combination under applicable accounting standards 
after completion of this step two test  a loss is recognized for the difference  if any  between the fair value of the goodwill associated with the reporting unit and the book value of that goodwill 
if the actual fair value of the goodwill is determined to be less than that estimated  an additional write down may be required 
during the fourth quarters of  and  we performed the annual goodwill impairment test 
we perform this test at the reporting unit level  which is one level below the segment level for the modular carpet segment and at the level of the bentley prince street segment 
for our reporting units which carried a goodwill balance as of january   no impairment of goodwill was indicated 
as of january   if our estimates of the fair value of our reporting units were lower  we believe no additional goodwill impairment would have existed 
inventories 
we determine the value of inventories using the lower of cost or market 
we write down inventories for the difference between the carrying value of the inventories and their net realizable value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
we estimate our reserves for inventory obsolescence by continuously examining our inventories to determine if there are indicators that carrying values exceed net realizable values 
experience has shown that significant indicators that could require the need for additional inventory write downs are the age of the inventory  the length of its product life cycles  anticipated demand for our products and current economic conditions 
while we believe that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements  consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
our inventory reserve on january   and january   was million and million  respectively 
to the extent that actual obsolescence of our inventory differs from our estimate by  our net income would be higher or lower by approximately million  on an after tax basis 
pension benefits 
net pension expense recorded is based on  among other things  assumptions about the discount rate  estimated return on plan assets and salary increases 
while management believes these assumptions are reasonable  changes in these and other factors and differences between actual and assumed changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of our plans above certain thresholds could cause net annual expense to increase or decrease materially from year to year 
the actuarial assumptions used in our salary continuation plan and our foreign defined benefit plans reporting are reviewed periodically and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension benefit obligation 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on weighted average expected returns for each asset class 
expected returns reflect a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets  and include input from actuaries  investment service firms and investment managers 
the table below represents the changes to the projected benefit obligation as a result of changes in discount rates assumptions september  foreign defined benefit plans increase decrease in projected benefit obligation in millions increase in actuarial assumption for discount rate decrease in actuarial assumption for discount rate domestic salary continuation plan increase decrease in projected benefit obligation in millions increase in actuarial assumption for discount rate decrease in actuarial assumption for discount rate environmental remediation 
we provide for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures and are discounted in certain instances 
we regularly monitor the progress of environmental remediation 
should studies indicate that the cost of remediation is to be more than previously estimated  an additional accrual would be recorded in the period in which such determination is made 
as of january   and january   no significant amounts were provided for remediation liabilities 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
estimating this amount requires us to analyze the financial strengths of our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
by its nature  such an estimate is highly subjective  and it is possible that the amount of accounts receivable that we are unable to collect may be different than the amount initially estimated 
our allowance for doubtful accounts on january   and january   was million and million  respectively 
to the extent the actual collectability of our accounts receivable differs from our estimates by  our net income would be higher or lower by approximately million  on an after tax basis  depending on whether the actual collectability was better or worse  respectively  than the estimated allowance 
product warranties 
we typically provide limited warranties with respect to certain attributes of our carpet products for example  warranties regarding excessive surface wear  edge ravel and static electricity for periods ranging from ten to twenty years  depending on the particular carpet product and the environment in which the product is to be installed 
we typically warrant that any services performed will be free from defects in workmanship for a period of one year following completion 
in the event of a breach of warranty  the remedy typically is limited to repair of the problem or replacement of the affected product 
we record a provision related to warranty costs based on historical experience and periodically adjust these provisions to reflect changes in actual experience 
our warranty reserve on january   and january   was million and million  respectively 
actual warranty expense incurred could vary significantly from amounts that we estimate 
to the extent the actual warranty expense differs from our estimates by  our net income would be higher or lower by approximately million  on an after tax basis  depending on whether the actual expense is lower or higher  respectively  than the estimated provision

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard regarding the performance of a company s annual goodwill impairment evaluation 
this standard allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  at this time  we do not expect adoption of this standard to have any significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb amended an accounting standard regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
this amendment will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
the amended guidance  which must be applied retroactively  was to be effective for interim and annual periods ending after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
in december of  the fasb issued an amendment to this statement which defers the requirements of this standard 
as this amendment only effects presentation  there is not expected to be any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance to amend the criteria for performing step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
such criteria now require performing step if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment to goodwill exists 
this recent guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   as well as for interim periods within such years 
the adoption of this standard did not have any significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk as a result of the scope of our global operations  we are exposed to an element of market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our results of operations and financial condition could be impacted by this risk 
we manage our exposure to market risk through our regular operating and financial activities and  to the extent we deem appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we employ derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 
we monitor the use of derivative financial instruments through objective measurable systems  well defined market and credit risk limits  and timely reports to senior management according to prescribed guidelines 
we have established strict counter party credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions with a rating of investment grade or better 
as a result  we consider the risk of counter party default to be minimal 
interest rate market risk exposure changes in interest rates affect the interest paid on certain of our debt 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  our management has developed and implemented a policy to maintain the percentage of fixed and variable rate debt within certain parameters 
in the past  we have maintained a fixed variable rate mix within these parameters either by borrowing on a fixed rate basis or entering into interest rate swap transactions 
in the interest rate swaps  we agree to exchange  at specified levels  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal linked to libor 
as of january   and january   no such interest rate swaps were in place 
foreign currency exchange market risk exposure a significant portion of our operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
we manufacture our products in the united states  england  northern ireland  the netherlands  australia  china and thailand  and sell our products in more than countries 
in  we ceased manufacturing operations at our facility in canada 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and many other currencies  including the euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  australian dollar  thai baht and japanese yen 
when the us dollar strengthens against a foreign currency  the value of anticipated sales in those currencies decreases  and vice versa 
additionally  to the extent our foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar transact business in countries other than the united states  exchange rate changes between two foreign currencies could ultimately impact us 
finally  because we report in us dollars on a consolidated basis  foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have a translation impact on our financial position 
at january   we recognized a million decrease in our foreign currency translation adjustment account compared with january   because of the strengthening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies during sensitivity analysis for purposes of specific risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to measure the impact that market risk may have on the fair values of our market sensitive instruments 
to perform sensitivity analysis  we assess the risk of loss in fair values associated with the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market sensitive instruments 
the market value of instruments affected by interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk is computed based on the present value of future cash flows as impacted by the changes in the rates attributable to the market risk being measured 
the discount rates used for the present value computations were selected based on market interest and foreign currency exchange rates in effect at january  the values that result from these computations are then compared with the market values of the financial instruments 
the differences are the hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk 
interest rate risk based on a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in interest rates  with all other variables held constant  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt would be impacted by a net decrease of million 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a net increase in the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt of million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk as of january   a decrease or increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  with all other variables held constant  would result in a decrease in the fair value of our short term financial instruments primarily cash  accounts receivable and accounts payable of million or an increase in the fair value of our financial instruments of million  respectively 
as the impact of offsetting changes in the fair market value of our net foreign investments is not included in the sensitivity model  these results are not indicative of our actual exposure to foreign currency exchange risk
