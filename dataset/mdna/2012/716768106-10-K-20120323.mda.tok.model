overview based on our net sales of billion  we are north america s leading specialty provider of products  services and solutions for the lifetime needs of pets 
as of january   we operated  stores  and we anticipate opening to net new stores in our stores carry a broad assortment of high quality pet supplies at everyday low prices 
we offer approximately  distinct items  including nationally recognized brand names  as well as an extensive selection of proprietary brands across a range of product categories 
we complement our extensive product assortment with a wide selection of pet services  including grooming  training  boarding and day camp 
all our stores feature pet styling salons that provide high quality grooming services and offer comprehensive pet training services 
petshotels provide boarding for dogs and cats  which includes hour supervision by caregivers who are petsmart trained to provide personalized pet care  an on call veterinarian  temperature controlled rooms and suites  daily specialty treats and play time  as well as day camp for dogs

as of january   full service veterinary hospitals were in of our stores 
banfield operated of the veterinary hospitals 
the remaining hospitals are operated by other third parties in canada 
the principal challenges we face as a business are the highly competitive market in which we operate and the continuing changes in the macro economy 
however  we believe we have a competitive advantage in our solutions for the total lifetime care sm of pets  including pet services and proprietary brands  which we believe cannot be easily duplicated 
additionally  we believe that our cash flow from operations and cash on hand will be adequate to meet our operating  investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future and we continue to have access to our revolving credit facility 
we expect to continuously assess the economic environment and market conditions to guide our decisions regarding our uses of cash  including capital expenditures  investments  dividends and share repurchases

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates for inventory valuation reserves  asset impairments  reserve for closed stores  insurance liabilities and reserves  and income tax reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation reserves we have established reserves for estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventories 
distribution centers perform cycle counts encompassing all inventory items at least once every quarter 
stores generally perform physical inventories at least once a year 
between the physical inventories  stores perform counts on certain inventory items 
for each reporting period presented  we estimate the inventory shrinkage based on a two year historical trend analysis 
changes in shrink results or market conditions could cause actual results to vary from estimates used to establish the inventory reserves 
we also have reserves for estimated obsolescence and to reduce merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at their historical cost 
factors included in determining obsolescence reserves include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of merchandise  seasonal trends and decisions to discontinue certain products 
if assumptions about future demand change  or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may require additional reserves 
we have not made any significant changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our inventory valuation reserves during the past three fiscal years 
we do not presently believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the accounting methodology and assumed factors used to create the estimates we use to calculate our inventory valuation reserves 
as of january   and january   we had inventory valuation reserves of million and million  respectively 
additionally  we do not believe that a change in our inventory valuation reserves would be material to our consolidated financial statements 
asset impairments we review long lived assets for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of such assets may not be recoverable 
we have not made any significant changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not presently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
no material asset impairments were identified during  or reserve for closed stores we continuously evaluate the performance of our stores and periodically close those that are under performing 
closed stores are generally replaced by a new store in a nearby location 
we establish reserves for future occupancy payments on closed stores in the period the store is closed 
these costs are classified in operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
as of january   and january   our reserve for closed stores was million and million  respectively 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that we use to determine our reserve for closed stores  including cash flow projections and sublease assumptions 
we do not believe that a change in our reserve for closed stores would be material to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents insurance liabilities and reserves we maintain workers compensation  general liability  product liability and property and casualty insurance 
we utilize high deductible plans for each of these areas as well as a self insured health plan for our eligible associates 
workers compensation deductibles generally carry a million per occurrence risk of claim liability 
our general liability plan specifies a million per occurrence risk of claim liability 
we establish reserves for claims under workers compensation and general liability plans based on periodic actuarial estimates of the amount of loss for all pending claims  including estimates for which claims have been incurred but not reported 
our loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events and changes in such assumptions could result in an adjustment  favorable or adverse  to our reserves 
as of january   and january   we had approximately million and million  respectively  in reserves related to workers compensation  general liability and self insured health plans 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our insurance reserves during the past three years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate our insurance reserves  including factors such as historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other valuations 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our insurance reserves would have affected net income by approximately million in income tax reserves we establish deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance on the deferred income tax assets to reduce the total to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
valuation allowances at january   and january   were principally to offset certain deferred income tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in any of these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves  our effective income tax rate in a given fiscal period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and could result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement could result in a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material

the rate improvement is the result of increased sales of higher margin goods within the product categories and improvement in shrink during  relative to mix was negatively impacted as the sales growth in our consumables continued to outpace the sales growth of our higher margin hardgoods category 
hardgoods merchandise includes pet supplies such as collars  leashes  health care supplies  grooming and beauty aids  toys and apparel  as well as pet beds and carriers 
consumables merchandise sales  which include pet food  treats  and litter  generate lower gross margins on average compared to hardgoods merchandise 
services margin increased basis points primarily due to increased sales as well as a shift to higher margin offerings in our grooming services 
services sales typically generate lower gross margins than merchandise sales as service related labor is included in cost of sales  however  services generate higher operating margins than merchandise sales 
store occupancy costs included in margin provided basis points due to leverage associated with the increase in net sales 
operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative expenses decreased basis points to of net sales for  from of net sales for operating  general and administrative expenses increased on a dollar basis by million

income tax expense for  the million income tax expense represents an effective tax rate of compared with  when we had income tax expense of million  which represented an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a tax deductible dividend received from banfield  partially offset by an increase in certain state tax liabilities 
the effective tax rate is calculated by dividing our income tax expense  which includes the income tax expense related to our equity in income from banfield  by income before income tax expense and equity in income from banfield

our hardgoods sales outpaced the sales growth of our consumables category during  primarily due to the addition of the flea and tick product line 
the flea and tick margin  net of shrink  was slightly higher than our average consumables margin  but significantly less than our average merchandise margin 
hardgoods merchandise includes pet supplies such as collars  leashes  health care supplies  grooming and beauty aids  toys and apparel  as well as pet beds and carriers 
consumables merchandise sales  which include pet food  treats  and litter  generate lower gross margins on average compared to hardgoods merchandise 

table of contents services negatively contributed to gross margin by basis points 
services sales typically generate lower gross margins than merchandise sales as service related labor is included in cost of sales  however  services generate higher operating margins than merchandise sales 
store occupancy costs included in gross margin provided basis points of improvement due to leverage associated with the increase in net sales  favorable lease negotiations and lower utility costs 
warehouse and distribution costs included in gross margin provided a benefit of basis points due to leverage associated with the increase in net sales 
recognizing reimbursements from banfield as other revenue negatively impacted gross margin by basis points 
in accordance with our master operating agreement with banfield  we charge banfield license fees for the space used by the veterinary hospitals and for their portion of utilities costs 
we also charge banfield for its portion of specific operating expenses 
prior to february   license fees were treated as a reduction of occupancy costs  which are included as a component of cost of merchandise sales  and reimbursements for specific operating expenses were treated as a reduction of operating  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income

operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales for from of net sales for operating  general and administrative expenses increased on a dollar basis by million 
the primary reasons for the year over year increase include increases in costs for incentive compensation associated with better than expected financial results  increased advertising costs  higher bank fees associated with increases in debit card rates and higher claims expense for health insurance

equity in income from banfield our equity in income from our investment in banfield was million and million for and  respectively  based on our ownership percentage in banfield 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow we believe that our operating cash flow and cash on hand will be adequate to meet our operating  investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future 
in addition  we also have access to our million revolving credit facility  although there can be no assurance of our ability to access these markets on commercially acceptable terms in the future 
we expect to continuously assess the economic environment and market conditions to guide our decisions regarding our uses of cash  including capital expenditures  investments  dividends and the purchase of treasury stock 
we finance our operations  new store and petshotel growth  store remodels and other expenditures to support our growth initiatives primarily through cash generated by operating activities 
receipts from our sales come from cash  checks and third party debit and credit cards  and therefore provide a significant source of liquidity 
cash is used in operating activities primarily to fund procurement of merchandise inventories and other assets  net of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities

the primary differences between and were an increase in cash paid for treasury stock and an increase in our bank overdraft 
the primary difference between and was an increase in cash paid for treasury stock 
free cash flow free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec s rules 
management believes that free cash flow is an important financial measure for use in evaluating our financial performance and our ability to generate future cash from our business operations 
free cash flow should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity 
although other companies report free cash flow  numerous methods exist for calculating free cash flow 
as a result  the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate free cash flow 
we urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of another company 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash paid for property and equipment  and payments of capital lease obligations 
the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities  a gaap measure  to free cash flow  a non gaap measure in thousands 
year ended january  january  january  net cash provided by operating activities cash paid for property and equipment payments of capital lease obligations free cash flow  a non gaap measure for  our free cash flow increased primarily due to an increase in net income  an increase in non trade accounts payable resulting from the extension of vendor terms  a reduction in growth of merchandise inventory  receipt of a dividend from banfield  and a decrease in capital spending during for  our free cash flow decreased primarily due to increases in merchandise inventory balances  income tax payments  capital spending and capital lease payments during share purchase program in june  the board of directors approved a share purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to million of our common stock through january  during  we purchased million shares of our common stock for million under the million share purchase program

common stock dividends we believe our ability to generate cash allows us to invest in the growth of the business and  at the same time  distribute a quarterly dividend

during   and  we paid aggregate dividends of per share  per share  and per share  respectively 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements substantially all our stores are leased facilities 
we opened new stores and closed stores in generally  each new store requires capital expenditures of approximately million for fixtures  equipment and leasehold improvements  approximately million for inventory and approximately million for preopening costs 
we expect total capital spending to be million to million for  based on our plan to open approximately to net new stores and new petshotels  continuing our investment in the development of our information systems  adding to our services capacity with the expansion of certain grooming salons  remodeling or replacing certain store assets and continuing our store refresh program

credit facilities effective april   we elected to reduce the aggregate commitment amount under our million revolving credit facility  or revolving credit facility  to million  which allows us to avoid stand by costs related to the excess commitment amount

in addition  we are required to maintain a cash deposit with the lender equal to the amount of outstanding letters of credit or we may use other approved investments as collateral 
if we use other approved investments as collateral  we must have an amount on deposit which  when multiplied by the advance rate of  is equal to the amount of the outstanding letters of credit under the stand alone letter of credit facility

the revolving credit facility and stand alone letter of credit facility are secured by substantially all our personal property assets  our wholly owned subsidiaries and certain real property 
we intend to refinance our revolving credit facility and the stand alone letter of credit facility with similar facilities and terms before they expire on august  seasonality and inflation our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
we typically realize a higher portion of our net sales and operating profits during the fourth quarter due to increased holiday traffic 
as a result of this seasonality  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
controllable expenses could fluctuate from quarter to quarter in a year 
since our stores typically draw customers from a large trade area  sales also may be impacted by adverse weather or travel conditions  which are more prevalent during certain seasons of the year 
as a result of our expansion plans  the timing of new store and petshotel openings and related preopening costs  the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing stores and petshotels and the timing and estimated obligations of store closures  our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate 
finally  because new stores tend to experience higher payroll  advertising and other store level expenses as a percentage of sales than mature stores  new store openings will also contribute to lower store operating margins until these stores become established 
we expense preopening costs associated with each new location as the costs are incurred 

table of contents while we have experienced inflationary pressure in recent years  we have been able to largely mitigate the effect by increasing retail prices accordingly 
although neither inflation nor deflation has had a material impact on net operating results  we can make no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future

the provisions of the acts are not expected to have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements in the short term 
the longer term potential impacts of the acts to our business and the consolidated financial statements are currently uncertain 
we will continue to assess the impact of the acts on our health care plans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of our business 
such risk is principally associated with foreign exchange fluctuations 
foreign currency risk our canadian subsidiary operates stores and uses the canadian dollar as the functional currency and the united states dollar as the reporting currency 
we have certain exposures to foreign currency risk 
net sales in canada  denominated in united states dollars  were billion  or of our consolidated net sales for transaction gains and losses denominated in the united states dollar are recorded in cost of sales or operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income depending on the nature of the underlying transaction
