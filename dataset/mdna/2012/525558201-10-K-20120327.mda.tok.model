item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in our other securities and exchange commission filings 
the following discussion may contain predictions  estimates  and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures  and markets medical devices and implants for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease 
our principal product offerings are sold throughout the world  primarily in the united states  the european union and  to a lesser extent  japan 
we estimate that the annual worldwide market for all peripheral vascular devices approximates billion  within which our core product lines address roughly million 
we have grown our business by using a three pronged strategy competing in niche markets  expanding our worldwide direct sales force  and acquiring and developing complementary vascular devices 
we have used acquisitions as a primary means of further accessing the larger peripheral vascular device market  and we expect to continue to pursue this strategy in the future 
additionally  we have increased our efforts to expand our vascular device offerings through new product development efforts 
in  we introduced two new products to the market the second generation unballoon modeling catheter and the over the wire valvulotome 
we currently manufacture most of our product lines in our burlington  massachusetts  headquarters 
our products are used by vascular surgeons who treat peripheral vascular disease through both open surgical methods and endovascular techniques 
in contrast to interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists  neither of whom are certified to perform open surgical procedures  vascular surgeons can perform both open surgical and minimally invasive endovascular procedures  and are therefore uniquely positioned to provide a wider range of treatment options to patients 
below is a listing of our principal product lines and product categories our open vascular product category includes our balloon catheters  carotid shunts  remote endarterectomy devices  valvulotomes  vascular grafts  and vessel closure systems 
we also report the results of our distribution of the xenosure biologic patch in this category 
table of contents our endovascular and other product category includes our aortic stent grafts  contrast injection device  laparoscopic cholecystectomy devices  non occlusive modeling catheter  and radiopaque marking tape 
we also report the results of our distribution of the endologix powerlink system within this category 
we divested our aortic stent grafts in june and terminated our distribution of the endologix products in august  each of which was previously reported in this product category 
we evaluate the sales performance of our various product lines utilizing criteria that varies based upon the position of each product line in its expected life cycle 
for established products  we typically review unit sales and selling prices 
for newer or faster growing products  we typically also focus upon new account generation and customer retention 
to assist us in evaluating our business strategies  we regularly monitor long term technology trends in the peripheral vascular device market 
additionally  we consider the information obtained from discussions with the medical community in connection with the demand for our products  including potential new product launches 
we also use this information to help determine our competitive position in the peripheral vascular device market and our manufacturing capacity requirements 
our business opportunities include the following the long term growth of our sales force in north america  europe and japan  sometimes in connection with terminations of certain distributor relationships in order to expand our sales presence in new countries  the addition of complementary products through acquisitions  the updating of existing products and introduction of new products through research and development  and the introduction of our products in new markets upon obtainment of regulatory approvals in these markets 
we are currently pursuing each of these opportunities 
we sell our products primarily through a direct sales force 
as of december  our sales force was comprised of sales representatives in north america  the european union and japan 
we also sell our products in other countries through distributors 
our worldwide headquarters is located in burlington  massachusetts 
our international operations are headquartered in sulzbach  germany 
we also have sales offices located in tokyo  japan  madrid  spain  and milan  italy 
in  approximately of our net sales were generated in markets in which we employ direct sales representatives 
in recent years we have experienced comparatively greater success in product markets characterized by low or limited competition  for example the market for valvulotome devices 
in these markets  we believe that we have been able to increase selling prices without compromising market share 
there can be no assurance that we will not meet resistance to increased selling prices in the future 
in contrast  we have experienced comparatively lesser success in highly competitive product markets such as such as prosthetic polyester and eptfe grafts  where we face stronger competition from larger companies with greater resources 
while we believe that these challenging market dynamics can be mitigated by our strong relationships with our vascular surgeon customers  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in highly competitive markets 
because we believe that direct to hospital sales engender closer customer relationships  and allow for higher selling prices and gross margins  we periodically enter into transactions with our distributors to transition their sales of our medical devices to our direct sales organization in december  we entered into a definitive agreement with cardiva  sl to terminate its distribution of our products in spain effective as of june  the agreement required us to pay approximately million in exchange for this early termination  the purchase of their customer list 
table of contents for our products  certain customer contracts  their provision of sales and marketing services  and million of inventory 
in december  we entered into a definitive agreement with marcom medical aps to terminate its distribution of our products in denmark effective as of june  the agreement required us to pay approximately million in exchange for this early termination  the purchase of their customer list for our products  certain customer contracts  their provision of sales and marketing services  and minimal inventory 
we anticipate that the expansion of our direct sales organization to spain  and to a lesser extent  denmark may result in increased sales and marketing expenses during our strategy for growing our business includes the acquisition of complementary product lines and companies and occasionally the discontinuance or divestiture of products or activities that are no longer complementary in june  we divested our optilock implantable port to minvasive ltd 
for million 
in november  we acquired our lifespan eptfe vascular graft from angiotech pharmaceuticals  inc for million and related assets from edwards lifesciences for million 
in june  we divested our taarget and unifit stent grafts to duke vascular  inc for million 
in addition  duke vascular  inc 
assumed our future obligations for the associated unite and entrust clinical trials 
in august  we terminated our distribution of endologix s aortic stent graft products in europe in exchange for million 
in addition to relying upon acquisitions to grow our business  we also rely on our product development efforts to bring differentiated technology and next generation products to market 
these efforts have led to the following recent product launches in june  we launched the anastoclip gc vessel closure system 
in november  we launched the second generation of the unballoon non occlusive modeling catheter 
in december  we launched the over the wire lemaitre valvulotome 
in addition to our sales growth strategies  we have also executed several operational initiatives designed to consolidate and streamline manufacturing within our burlington  ma facilities 
we expect that these plant consolidations will yield improved control over our production capacity and our direct labor force as well as reduce redundant costs over the long term 
our most recent manufacturing transitions included in october  we adopted a reorganization plan that was designed to eliminate redundant costs resulting from our acquisition of biomateriali and to improve efficiencies in manufacturing operations 
we have completed the transition of albograft vascular graft manufacturing to our existing corporate headquarters in burlington  massachusetts 
in may  we adopted a reorganization plan that was designed to eliminate redundant costs resulting from our acquisition of the lifespan vascular graft and to improve efficiencies in manufacturing operations 
we have largely completed this transition to our existing corporate headquarters in burlington  massachusetts 
our execution of these business opportunities may affect the comparability of our financial results from period to period and may cause substantial fluctuations from period to period  both due to restructuring and similar non recurring charges  as well as longer term impacts to revenues and operating expenditures 
for example  we recognized million of revenue on our stent graft products during the year ended december   and also incurred sales  marketing  and research and development expenditures in connection with these product lines 
we expect that we will no longer recognize any further revenue or expenses from those product 
table of contents lines  as we have exited the stent graft market 
in connection with that exit  we realized a gain of approximately million as a result of the endologix transaction 
as another example  we recognized million and million of restructuring expenses in and  respectively  related to the biomateriali plant closure and relocation to burlington  ma 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the euro  affect our financial results 
for the year ended december   approximately of our sales were from outside the americas 
we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our sales in the future 
selling  marketing  and administrative costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currency  thereby partially mitigating our transaction risk exposure 
we therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is moderated 
however  most of our foreign sales are denominated in local currency  and if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect

represents the impact of sales related to discontinued and divested products  and discontinued distributed sales of other manufacturers products  during the comparable prior period  measured for months following the date of the event or transaction 
upon our divestiture of the stent graft product lines  we reorganized our product categories from vascular  endovascular  and general surgery to open vascular and endovascular and other as we re focused our portfolio and sales channel on open vascular products 
our consolidated financial statements and the related management discussion and analysis for the years ended december    and have been reclassified to reflect this change 
net sales and expense components the following is a description of the primary components of our net sales and expenses net sales 
we derive our net sales from the sale of our products  less discounts and returns 
net sales includes the shipping and handling fees paid for by our customers 
most of our sales are generated by our direct sales force and are shipped and billed to hospitals or clinics throughout the world 
in countries where we do not have a direct sales force  sales are primarily generated by shipments to distributors who  in turn  sell to hospitals and clinics 
in those cases where our products are held on consignment at a hospital or clinic  we generate sales at the time the product is used in surgery rather than at shipment 

table of contents cost of sales 
we manufacture nearly all of the products that we sell 
our cost of sales consists primarily of manufacturing personnel  raw materials and components  depreciation of property and equipment  and other allocated manufacturing overhead  as well as freight expense we pay to ship products to customers 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries  commissions  stock based compensation  travel and entertainment  attendance at medical society meetings  training programs  advertising and product promotions  direct mail  and other marketing costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of executive  finance and human resource expense  stock based compensation  legal and accounting fees  information technology expense  intangible amortization expense  and insurance expense 
research and development 
research and development expense includes costs associated with the design  development  testing  enhancement  and regulatory approval of our products  principally salaries  laboratory testing  and supply costs 
it also includes costs associated with design and execution of clinical studies  regulatory submissions and costs to register  maintain  and defend our intellectual property  and royalty payments associated with licensed and acquired intellectual property 
restructuring 
restructuring expense includes costs directly associated with distribution agreement termination expenses  severance and retention costs for terminated employees  factory relocation costs  and other expenses associated with restructuring our operations 
other income expense 
other income expense primarily includes interest income and expense  investment impairment charges  foreign currency gains losses  and other miscellaneous gains losses 
income tax expense 
we are subject to federal and state income taxes for earnings generated in the united states  which include operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for certain years depending on tax elections made  and foreign taxes on earnings of our wholly owned german  french  italian  spanish  and japanese subsidiaries 
our consolidated tax expense is affected by the mix of our taxable income loss in the united states  germany  france  italy  spain  and japan  permanent items  discrete items  unrecognized tax benefits  and amortization of goodwill for u

table of contents net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in sales in our open vascular product category grew  while sales in our endovascular and other product category decreased by from the previous year 
acquisitions  primarily the lifespan vascular graft  increased sales compared to divestitures  primarily of the taarget and unifit stent graft product lines as well as the termination of the endologix aortic stent graft distribution agreement  decreased sales from the prior year 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates added to year over year sales growth 
sales increases in were largely driven by higher average selling prices across nearly all product lines  as well as stronger sales of our open vascular products  primarily biologic patches of million  catheters of million and vessel closure systems of million  in addition to full year lifespan vascular graft sales and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these gains were partially offset by a million decrease in our endovascular and other product category  primarily due to the decline of  and subsequent exit from  stent grafts  as well as unit decreases in a number of open vascular products

at december   we employed sales representatives worldwide  compared to in the prior year period 
we plan to increase the size of our sales force in  though to a lesser extent than  and we expect that selling and marketing expenses will increase commensurately 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in the increase was largely the result of higher administrative costs associated with our french and spanish subsidiaries of million  higher amortization costs of million related to the lifespan vascular graft acquisition and our spanish distributor buy out  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates of million  partially offset by a reduction in administrative costs associated with our closure of the biomateriali subsidiary of million

research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses decreased to in from in the decrease was largely driven by a reduction in regulatory and clinical affairs costs of million in  related to the suspension of our unite and entrust trials in october in addition  product development costs decreased million in as we reduced animal testing associated with new products approvals 
on june   duke vascular  inc assumed all future obligations of the unite and entrust trials as part of our stent graft divestiture agreement 
process engineering expenses increased by million in as we increased staffing levels 
we expect research and development costs to increase marginally in as we continue to invest in new product development efforts 
restructuring 
restructuring charges were million in compared to million in in  we commenced the closure of our biomateriali manufacturing facility in brindisi  italy and the related transition of production to our existing corporate headquarters in burlington  massachusetts 
in  we incurred an additional million in restructuring charges related to this project 
these charges consisted of approximately million for the transfer of manufacturing equipment  million of charges associated with repayment of a development grant and loan from the italian government  and million related to deferred rent charges upon exiting the biomateriali facility in march in march  we completed the biomateriali liquidation and dissolution process 
in  we incurred a million restructuring charge related to the closure of our biomateriali manufacturing facility in brindisi  italy  and the related transition of production to our existing corporate headquarters in burlington  massachusetts 
the restructuring charge consisted of million of employee related severance charges  million of charges associated with repayment of a development grant and loan from the italian government  and million of charges related to the abandonment of fixed assets and legal fees 
in may  we adopted a reorganization plan the lifespan plan that was designed to eliminate redundant costs resulting from our acquisition of the lifespan vascular graft and to improve efficiencies in our manufacturing operations 
we have transitioned the production of our lifespan vascular graft from laguna hills  california to our existing corporate headquarters in burlington  massachusetts 
the lifespan plan resulted in the termination of employees at the laguna hills facility  relocation of manufacturing equipment  and the hiring of approximately employees to staff the required functions in burlington 
we incurred approximately million related to the closure of the laguna hills facility and the related relocation of the manufacturing equipment during the year ended december  we incurred approximately  of severance charges related to this project during year ended december  
table of contents on june   we terminated our relationship with our spanish distributor resulting in a contract termination charge of million which we recorded as restructuring charges 
on june   we terminated our relationship with our danish distributor resulting in a contract termination charge of million which we recorded as restructuring charges 
in july  we adopted a reorganization plan of our european administrative and stent graft sales personnel as a result of our exit from the stent graft business 
we terminated employees and recorded severance charges of million during the year ended december  the final severance payments were made in march in and  we initiated a series of strategic initiatives including the transition of albograft manufacturing from italy to burlington  the transition of lifespan manufacturing from california to burlington  the sale of our taarget and unifit assets  the termination of our endologix distribution agreement in europe  and the termination of our distributors in spain and denmark 
these initiatives are largely complete  and we do not expect them to incur additional restructuring or impairment charges in gain on termination of distribution agreement 
in july  we terminated our endologix distribution agreement for million  and recognized a gain of million as a result of the transaction 
impairment charges 
we incurred million of impairment charges in related to patents deemed to have no value based on future expected economic benefits 
we incurred million of impairment charges in of which million was due to the write down of certain technology  customer lists  and fixed assets related to our aortic stent graft product line 
additionally  we incurred a million impairment charge associated with a biomateriali private label customer relationship  which we subsequently terminated 
other income expense 
foreign exchange gains for were  compared to foreign exchange losses for of  in foreign exchange gains were due to the comparative weakening of the us dollar versus the euro during the year 
net interest income and other income expense was comparatively flat in versus income tax expense 
we recorded a provision for taxes of million on pre tax income of million in compared to a tax benefit of million on pre tax income of million in the provision was comprised of federal tax in the united states of million  taxes in certain foreign subsidiaries that are profitable of million and state taxes of million 
the benefit was primarily due to the release of our us deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million  and was partially offset by us deferred provision of million  taxes in certain foreign subsidiaries that are profitable of million  federal tax in the united states of million  and state taxes of million 
the valuation allowance reversal was to the result of achieving three year cumulative profitability which occurred in the fourth quarter of as well as our expectation of future taxable income in the united states 
our effective tax rate differed from the us statutory tax rate in principally due to permanent items  true up of historical deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance recorded against foreign deferred tax assets and state credits  change in our reserve for uncertain tax positions  and state taxes 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies 
we have assessed the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and concluded that as of december   we will continue to carry a valuation allowance against million of deferred tax assets  principally foreign net operating loss carry forwards  which based on the weight of available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
we expect that our effective tax rate will decrease slightly in due to a reduction to foreign taxes and we will be able to utilize federal research and development tax credits to reduce our regular tax to the alternative minimum tax rate

we did not hold any marketable securities nor any mortgage asset backed or auction rate securities in our investment portfolio as of december  in the event of a temporary decline in market value  we have the intent and ability to hold our investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested 
we continually monitor the asset allocation of our holdings in an attempt to mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures  and we intend to continue to closely monitor developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as necessary 

table of contents operating and capital expenditure requirements we require cash to pay our operating expenses  make capital expenditures  fund acquisitions  and pay our long term liabilities 
since our inception  we have funded our operations through private and public placements of equity securities  short term borrowings  and funds generated from our operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized operating income of million 
for the year ended december   we recognized operating income of million 
although it is our intention to generate an operating profit on an ongoing basis  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestitures and distributor terminations  there can be no assurance that we will generate an operating profit in the future due to our continued investment in growing our business 
we expect to fund any increased costs and expenditures from our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  though our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the revenues generated by sales of our products  payments associated with potential future quarterly cash dividends to our common stockholders  payments associated with our stock repurchase plan  payments associated with u 
s income taxes  the costs associated with expanding our manufacturing  marketing  sales  and distribution efforts  the rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities  the costs of obtaining and maintaining fda and other regulatory clearances of our existing and future products  the effects of competing technological and market developments  and the number  timing  and nature of acquisitions and other strategic transactions our cash balances may decrease as we continue to use cash to fund our operations  make acquisitions  make purchases under our share repurchase program  make payments under our quarterly dividend program  and make deferred payments related to prior acquisitions 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  investments and the interest we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if these sources of cash are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements beyond the next twelve months  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or borrow from a financial institution 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  such securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
italian loan and grant as part of the purchase of biomateriali srl  we assumed a loan from the italian government under a program that provides funding to certain businesses in italy through a combination of grants and loans if certain requirements are met 
the loan was stated to be payable in ten annual payments through of principal and interest at an interest rate of 
the present value of the loan was recorded as of the date the proceeds were received using our incremental borrowing rate 
interest was being imputed on the loan and the amortization was recorded as interest expense 
the italian government informed us the loan and grant will become due in full as a result of the biomateriali srl plant closure 
as a result  in december  we incurred approximately million of restructuring charges related to additional interest and penalties charges  and we made the final payment to the italian government of million in december in  we had previously recorded approximately million of restructuring charges related to the expected repayment of the grants  the imputed interest on the outstanding loan balance  and certain additional interest and penalties

dividends 
on february   our board of directors approved a policy for the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock of per share 
future declarations of quarterly dividends and the 
table of contents establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to approval by our board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the dividend activity for the year ended december  is as follows record date payment date per share amount dividend payment in thousands march  april  may  june  august  september  november  december  on february   our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of per share payable on april   to stockholders of record at the close of business on march   which will total approximately million 
contractual obligations 
our principal contractual obligations consist of operating leases and inventory purchase commitments 
the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases purchase commitments for inventory total contractual obligations the commitments under our operating leases consist primarily of lease payments for our burlington  massachusetts  corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility  expiring in  our sulzbach  germany office  expiring in  our tokyo  japan office  expiring in  and our milan  italy office  expiring in they also include automobile and equipment leases 
the purchase commitments for inventory are to be used in operations over the normal course of business and do not represent excess commitments or loss contracts 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  sales returns and discounts  and income taxes are reviewed on an ongoing basis and updated as appropriate 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  and observance of trends in the industry  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 

table of contents we believe that the following financial estimates and related accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements 
those financial estimates and related policies include revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of disposable or implantable devices used during vascular surgery 
we sell directly to hospitals and to distributors  as described below  and  during the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements  entered into consigned inventory arrangements with either hospitals or distributors on a limited basis 
we recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generally use customer purchase orders or contracts to determine the existence of an arrangement 
substantially all sales transactions are based on prices that are determinable at the time that the customer s purchase order is accepted by us 
in order to determine whether collection is reasonably assured  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we would defer the recognition of revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we provide for product returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our historical return product history 
based on these policies  we recognize revenue  net of allowances for returns and discounts  as products are shipped  based on shipping point terms  or at the time consigned inventory is consumed at which time title passes to customers 
we recognize revenue net of allowances for returns and discounts  at the time of shipment of our products to our distributors 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable are with customers based in the united states and internationally 
accounts receivable generally are due within to days of invoice and are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  other than in certain european markets where longer payment terms are customary and may range from to days 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the current creditworthiness of the customers  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor aging reports  collections  and payments from customers  and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues we identify 
we closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks  including those that may arise from economic conditions  in both the us and international economies 
our european sales to government owned or supported customers such as hospitals  distributors and agents  in southern europe  specifically italy  spain and greece may be subject to significant payment delays due to government austerity measures impacting funding and payment practices 
as of december  our receivables in italy  spain and greece totaled million  million and million  respectively 
receivables balances with certain publicly owned hospitals and government supported customers in these countries can accumulate over a period of time and then subsequently be settled as large lump sum payments 
while we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts in these countries is adequate as of december   if significant changes were to occur in the payment practices of these european governments or if government funding becomes unavailable  we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers and our write offs of uncollectible amounts may increase 

table of contents we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and allowances  we cannot guarantee the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
the provision for the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in general and administrative expenses 
inventory inventory consists of finished products  work in process  and raw materials 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
cost includes materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead and is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast  which is based on sales history and anticipated future demand 
our estimates of future product demand may not be accurate  and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
stock based compensation we recognize  as expense  the estimated fair value of stock options to employees which is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
we have elected to recognize the compensation cost of all share based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
in periods that we grant stock options  fair value assumptions are based on volatility  interest  dividend yield  and expected term over which the stock options will be outstanding 
the computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury risk free interest rate in effect at the time of grant 
the expected lives of the options were estimated using the simplified method for plain vanilla options 
computation of expected forfeitures is based on historical forfeiture rates of our share based awards 
we also issue restricted stock units rsus as an additional form of equity compensation to our employees  officers  and directors  pursuant to our stockholder approved plan 
rsus entitle the grantee to an issuance of stock at no cost and generally vest over a period of time determined by our board of directors at the time of grant based upon the continued service to the company 
the fair market value of the award is determined based on the number of rsus granted and the market value of our common stock on the grant date and is amortized to expense over the period of vesting 
computation of expected forfeitures is based on historical forfeiture rates of our share based awards 
unvested rsus are forfeited and canceled as of the date that employment or service to the company terminates 
rsus are settled in shares of our common stock upon vesting 
we may repurchase common stock upon our employees vesting in rsus in order to cover any minimum tax withholding liability as a result of the rsus having vested 
we used an expected forfeiture rate of approximately   and for   and  respectively 
share based compensation charges are recorded net of the estimated forfeitures and will be adjusted in future periods to reflect the results of actual forfeitures and vesting 
share based compensation charges are recorded across the consolidated statement of operations based upon the grantee s primary function 
as disclosed more fully in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we recorded expense of approximately million in connection with share based payment awards for the year ended december  the future expense of non vested share based awards of approximately million is to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
during  we granted stock options at a weighted average fair value of and restricted stock units with weighted average fair value of 

table of contents valuation of goodwill  other intangibles goodwill represents the amount of consideration paid in connection with business acquisitions in excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist 
we evaluate the december balance of the carrying value of goodwill based on a single reporting unit annually 
we perform an assessment of qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
if required  the next step of the goodwill impairment test is to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined on the same basis as the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with a business combination 
specifically  the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination as of the date of the impairment review and as if the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
goodwill was million as of december  and our annual impairment testing indicated no significant risk of impairment based upon changes in value that are reasonably likely to occur 
however  changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of our reporting unit 
other intangible assets consist primarily of purchased developed technology  patents  customer relationships  and trademarks and are amortized over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
we review intangible assets quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist for a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment 
conditions that may indicate impairment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of the asset  a change in the operating cash flows associated with the asset  or adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset  we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified 
we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets  we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions  cost structures  and remaining useful lives of the asset 
these estimates and assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million as of december   and million as of december  we recognized impairment charges on our intangible assets of million in  million in  and million in contingencies in the normal course of business  we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  and other claims and assessments for matters related to  among other things  patent infringement  business acquisitions  employment  and product recalls 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
we record charges for the costs we anticipate incurring in connection with litigation and claims against us when we determine a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate these costs 
during the years ended december    and  we were not subject to any material litigation  claims or assessments 

table of contents restructuring we record restructuring charges incurred in connection with consolidation or relocation of operations  exited business lines  or distributor terminations 
these restructuring charges  which reflect our commitment to a termination or exit plan that will begin within twelve months  are based on estimates of the expected costs associated with site closure  legal matters  contract terminations  or other costs directly related to the restructuring 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  an additional charge to earnings will result 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a credit to earnings will be recognized 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from taxable income during the carryback period or in the future  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we do not provide for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  as our current intention is to permanently reinvest these earnings 
we recognize  measure  present and disclose in our financial statements  uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return 
we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions  both within the united states and outside of the united states and may be subject to audits from various tax authorities regarding transfer pricing  the deductibility of certain expenses  intercompany transactions  and other matters 
within specific countries  we may be subject to audit by various tax authorities operating within the country and may be subject to different statutes of limitation expiration dates 
management s judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  liabilities for uncertain tax positions  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
we have recorded a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
marketable securities we consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents  and investments with maturities of greater than days at the time of purchase to be marketable securities 
the unrealized gains losses on available for sale securities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
when a marketable security incurs a significant unrealized loss for a sustained period of time  we review the instrument to determine if it is other than temporarily impaired 
if we conclude an instrument is other than temporarily impaired  we record the unrealized loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
we did not hold any marketable securities as of december  and december  recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended existing rules covering fair value measurement and disclosure to clarify guidance and minimize differences between us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the new guidance requires us to provide information about valuation techniques and unobservable inputs used in level fair value measurements and provide a narrative description of the sensitivity of level measurements to changes in unobservable inputs 
the guidance is effective on january  we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents in june  new guidance was issued pertaining to the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new rule eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
the standard is intended to provide a more consistent method of presenting non owner transactions that affect the company s equity 
under the new guidance  an entity can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years that begin after december  we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued new authoritative guidance pertaining to the testing of goodwill for impairment which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under this new guidance  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the changes are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   however  early adoption is permitted 
we adopted the new authoritative guidance in the fourth quarter of in connection with our annual impairment test 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this item is not applicable to us as a smaller reporting company
