table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are generally cash flows generated by operating activities and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we utilize these capital resources to make capital expenditures associated primarily with our customer contact management services  invest in technology applications and tools to further develop our service offerings and for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including repurchase of our common stock in the open market and to fund possible acquisitions 
in future periods  we intend similar uses of these funds 
on august   our board authorized us to purchase up to million shares of our outstanding common stock the share repurchase program and on august   our board authorized us to purchase up to million shares of our outstanding common stock the share repurchase program

the shares are purchased  from time to time  through open market purchases or in negotiated private transactions  and the purchases are based on factors  including but not limited to  the stock price and general market conditions 
the share repurchase program has no expiration date 
we may make additional discretionary stock repurchases under this program in during  cash increased million from operating activities  proceeds from sale of property and equipment of million  proceeds from an insurance settlement of million and proceeds from issuance of stock of million 
further  we used million on the repurchase of our stock  million for capital expenditures  million to repurchase stock for minimum tax withholding on equity awards  million to refund grants and million investment in restricted cash resulting in a million increase in available cash including the unfavorable effects of international currency exchange rates on cash of million 
net cash flows provided by operating activities for were million  compared to million provided by operating activities for the million increase in net cash flows from operating activities was due to a million increase in net income and a net increase of million in cash flows from assets and liabilities  partially offset by a million decrease in non cash reconciling items such as the loss on sale of discontinued operations  depreciation and amortization  net gain on disposal of property and equipment  impairment charges  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and stock based compensation 
the million increase in cash flows from assets and liabilities was principally a result of a million decrease in receivables  a million increase in deferred revenue and a million increase in income taxes payable  partially offset by a million decrease in other liabilities and a million increase in other assets 
the increase in cash flows from assets and liabilities primarily relates to the timing of receivables billings and subsequent payments of those billings  coupled with a reduction in revenues in the fourth quarter in over the comparable period in during  we committed to a plan to sell our operations in spain 
during  we sold our argentine operations 
cash flows from discontinued operations were as follows in millions years ended december  cash provided by used for operating activities of discontinued operations cash provided by used for investing activities of discontinued operations cash provided by used for operating activities of discontinued operations represents the cash provided by used for the spanish and argentine operations in  and cash used for investing activities of discontinued operations represents capital expenditures in and cash used for investing activities of discontinued operations in primarily represents cash on the balance sheet of the argentine operations at the time of the sale 
the sale of the argentine operations resulted in a pre tax loss of million  or a million loss  net of tax 
we do not expect the absence of the cash flows from our discontinued operations in spain to materially affect our future liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents capital expenditures  which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities  available cash balances and borrowings available under our credit facilities  were million for  compared to million for  an increase of million 
in  we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of million to million  primarily for maintenance and systems infrastructure 
on february   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with a group of lenders and keybank  as lead arranger  sole book runner and administrative agent 
the credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility  which is subject to certain borrowing limitations and includes certain customary financial and restrictive covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with all loan requirements of the credit agreement and had no outstanding borrowings under the facility 
the million revolving credit facility provided under the credit agreement includes a million multi currency sub facility  a million swingline sub facility and a million letter of credit sub facility  which may be used for general corporate purposes including strategic acquisitions  share repurchases  working capital support  and letters of credit  subject to certain limitations 
we are not currently aware of any inability of our lenders to provide access to the full commitment of funds that exist under the revolving credit facility  if necessary 
however  there can be no assurance that such facility will be available to us  even though it is a binding commitment 
the revolving credit facility will mature on february  borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either libor or the base rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio 
the applicable interest rate is determined quarterly based on our leverage ratio at such time 
the base rate is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of i the rate of interest established by keybank  from time to time  as its prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate in effect from time to time  plus of per annum  and iii the then applicable libor rate for one month interest periods  plus 
swingline loans bear interest only at the base rate plus the base rate margin 
in addition  we are required to pay certain customary fees  including a commitment fee of up to  which is due quarterly in arrears and calculated on the average unused amount of the revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct and indirect material us subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of of the non voting and of the voting capital stock of all of our direct foreign subsidiaries and those of the guarantors 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  of which approximately or million  was held in international operations and may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the united states  including withholding tax applied by the country of origin and an incremental us income tax  net of allowable foreign tax credits 
there are circumstances where we may be unable to repatriate some of the cash and cash equivalents held by our international operations due to country restrictions 
we believe that our current cash levels  accessible funds under our credit facilities and cash flows generated from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs  any future debt repayment requirements  continued expansion objectives  funding of potential acquisitions  anticipated levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations for the next twelve months and any stock repurchases 
our cash resources could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in item a  risk factors 
off balance sheet arrangements and other at december   we did not have any material commercial commitments  including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations  or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
from time to time  during the normal course of business  we may make certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include  but are not limited to i indemnities to clients  vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct and ii indemnities involving breach of contract  the accuracy of representations and warranties  or other liabilities assumed by us in certain contracts 
in addition  we have agreements whereby we will 
table of contents indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we have some client contracts that do not contain contractual provisions for the limitation of liability  and other client contracts that contain agreed upon exceptions to limitation of liability 
we have not recorded any liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets with respect to any client contracts under which we have or may have unlimited liability 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years other operating leases purchase obligations and other accounts payable accrued employee compensation and benefits other accrued expenses and current liabilities long term tax liabilities other long term liabilities amounts represent the expected cash payments of our operating leases as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
accounts payable and accrued employee compensation and benefits see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which represent amounts due vendors and employees payable within one year 
other accrued expenses and current liabilities  which exclude deferred grants  include amounts as disclosed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  primarily related to restructuring costs  legal and professional fees  telephone charges  rent  derivative contracts and other accruals 
long term tax liabilities include uncertain tax positions and related penalties and interest as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the cash settlement of million of the long term liabilities with the taxing authority  therefore  amounts have been excluded from payments due by period 
other long term liabilities  which exclude deferred income taxes and other non cash long term liabilities  represent the expected cash payments due under restructuring accruals primarily lease obligations and pension obligations 
see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results 
unless we need to clarify a point to readers  we will refrain from citing specific section references when discussing the application of accounting principles or addressing new or pending accounting rule changes 

table of contents recognition of revenue we recognize revenue in accordance with asc revenue recognition 
we primarily recognize revenues from services as the services are performed  which is based on either a per minute  per call or per transaction basis  under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenues for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies 
revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions 
product sales  accounted for within our fulfillment services  are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations 
in accordance with asc asc revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  revenue from contracts with multiple deliverables is allocated to separate units of accounting based on their relative fair value  if the deliverables in the contract s meet the criteria for such treatment 
certain fulfillment services contracts contain multiple deliverables 
separation criteria includes whether a delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and  if the arrangement includes a general right of return related to a delivered item  whether delivery of the undelivered item is considered probable and in our control 
fair value is the price of a deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand alone basis  which generally consists of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
if there is no evidence of the fair value for a delivered product or service  revenue is allocated first to the fair value of the undelivered product or service and then the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered product or service 
if there is no evidence of the fair value for an undelivered product or service  the contract s is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in delay of revenue recognition for the delivered product or service until the undelivered product or service portion of the contract is complete 
we recognize revenues for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved  and there are no client negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements 
once we determine the allocation of revenues between deliverable elements  there are no further changes in the revenue allocation 
if the separation criteria are met  revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement 
if the separation criteria are not met because there is insufficient evidence to determine fair value of one of the deliverables  all of the services are accounted for as a single combined unit of accounting 
for deliverables with insufficient evidence to determine fair value  revenue is recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight line basis over the contract period  or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client  as appropriate 
as of december   our fulfillment contracts with multiple deliverables met the separation criteria as outlined in asc and the revenue was accounted for accordingly 
we have no other contracts that contain multiple deliverables as of december  in october  the financial accounting standards board amended the accounting standards for certain multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
we adopted this guidance on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originated or materially modified since january   the adoption date 
since there were no such transactions executed or materially modified since adoption on january   there was no impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the amended standard updates guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  requires an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using the best estimated selling price of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price or third party evidence of selling price  and eliminates the use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  million as of december   or of trade account receivables  for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our estimate is based on qualitative and quantitative analyses  including credit risk measurement tools and methodologies using the publicly available credit and capital market information  a review of the current status of our trade accounts receivable and historical collection experience of our clients 
it is reasonably possible that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments 

table of contents income taxes we reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  both positive and negative  for each respective tax jurisdiction  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction is allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that jurisdiction on a pro rata basis 
available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes  but is not limited to  our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies 
establishment or reversal of certain valuation allowances may have a significant impact on both current and future results 
as of december   we determined that a total valuation allowance of million was necessary to reduce us deferred tax assets by million and foreign deferred tax assets by million  where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax asset of million as of december  is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction 
as of december   based on our estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies within various tax jurisdictions  we believe that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized 
a provision for income taxes has not been made for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately million as of december   as the earnings are indefinitely reinvested in foreign business operations 
if these earnings are repatriated or otherwise become taxable in the u 
s  we would be subject to an incremental us tax expense net of any allowable foreign tax credits  in addition to any applicable foreign withholding tax expense 
determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable 
the us department of the treasury released the general explanations of the administration s fiscal year revenue proposals in february these proposals represent a significant shift in international tax policy  which may materially impact us taxation of international earnings 
we continue to monitor these proposals and are currently evaluating their potential impact on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable 
we evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns  and record a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
asc contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
first  tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
second  the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  a net decrease of million from million as of december  this decrease results primarily from the expiration of statutes of limitations on certain foreign subsidiaries and the resolution of a tax audit in the current year 
had we recognized these tax benefits  approximately million and million and the related interest and penalties would favorably impact the effective tax rate in and  respectively 
we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease or be recognized in the next twelve months by up to million due to expiration of statutes of limitations  audit or appeal resolution in various tax jurisdictions 
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and is impacted by the distribution of earnings in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
our effective tax rate could be impacted by earnings being either proportionally lower or higher in foreign countries where we have tax rates lower than the us tax rates 
in addition  we have been granted tax holidays in several foreign tax jurisdictions  which have various expiration dates ranging from through if we are unable to renew a tax holiday in any of these jurisdictions  our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted 
in some cases  the tax holidays expire without 
table of contents possibility of renewal 
in other cases  we expect to renew these tax holidays  but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will permit a renewal 
our effective tax rate could also be affected by several additional factors  including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  changing legislation  regulations  and court interpretations that impact tax law in multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate  as well as new requirements  pronouncements and rulings of certain tax  regulatory and accounting organizations 
impairment of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets we review long lived assets  which had a carrying value of million as of december   including goodwill  intangibles and property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and at least annually for impairment testing of goodwill 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
upon determination that the carrying value of the asset is impaired  we would record an impairment charge  or loss  to reduce the asset to its fair value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and  therefore  might require an impairment charge in the future 
new accounting standards not yet adopted in may  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued accounting standards update asu asu fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
the amendments in asu result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
consequently  the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
some of the amendments clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements 
other amendments change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the amendments in asu are to be applied prospectively and are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu as of january  did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued asu asu comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
the amendments in asu require that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in the two statement approach  the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income  the components of other comprehensive income  and the total of comprehensive income 
the amendments in asu are to be applied retrospectively and are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december   and may be early adopted 
as this standard impacts presentation only  the adoption of asu as of january  did not impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued asu asu intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in asu provide entities with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
under the amendments in asu  an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the amendments in asu are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   and may be early adopted 
the adoption of asu as of january  did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued asu asu balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the amendments in asu will enhance disclosures by requiring improved information about financial and derivative instruments that are either offset netting assets and liabilities in accordance with section or section of the fasb accounting standards codification or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement 
the amendments in asu are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those years 
an entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
we do not expect the adoption of asu to materially impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued asu asu comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 

the amendments in asu defer the requirement to present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements 
the amendments in asu are effective at the same time as asu so that entities will not be required to comply with the presentation requirements in asu that asu is deferring 
the amendments in asu are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  as asu impacts presentation only  the adoption of asu as of january  did not impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
us healthcare reform acts in march  the president of the united states signed into law comprehensive healthcare reform legislation under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act the acts 
the acts contain provisions that could materially impact our healthcare costs in the future  thus adversely affecting our profitability 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the acts  if any  on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
preliminary analyses indicate that the increased cost of providing healthcare benefits in the future may not materially affect our profitability  however  there are many provisions of the acts that have yet to be defined and which may be affected by the national elections 
the effect on our healthcare costs in the future may not be known for some time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar usd are translated into our usd consolidated financial statements 
as exchange rates vary  those results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact profitability 
the cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the us dollar are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
movements in non us dollar currency exchange rates may negatively or positively affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
we employ a foreign currency risk management program that periodically utilizes derivative instruments to protect against unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in foreign currency exchange fx rates 
option and forward derivative contracts are used to hedge intercompany receivables and payables  and other transactions initiated in the united states  that are denominated in a foreign currency 
additionally  we may employ fx contracts to hedge net investments in foreign operations 
we serve a number of us based clients using customer contact management center capacity in the philippines  canada and costa rica  which are within our americas segment 
although the contracts with these clients are priced in usds  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in philippine pesos php  canadian dollars cad and costa rican colones crc  which represent fx exposures 
in order to hedge a portion of our anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in php and crc  we had outstanding forward contracts and options as of december  with counterparties through september 
table of contents with notional amounts totaling million 
as of december   we had net total derivative assets associated with these contracts with a fair value of million  which will settle within the next months 
if the usd was to weaken against the php and crc by from current period end levels  we would incur a loss of approximately million on the underlying exposures of the derivative instruments 
however  this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
we also entered into forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges 
the purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect against fx volatility pertaining to intercompany receivables and payables  and other assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
as of december   the fair value of these derivatives was a net payable of million 
the potential loss in fair value at december   for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately million 
however  this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into contracts with those considered to have minimal credit risk 
we periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
as a general rule  we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists 
for example  in many countries  revenue from the local currency services substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk results from variable debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility under our credit agreement 
we pay interest on outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base rates 
during the year ended december   we had no debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we have not historically used derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates
