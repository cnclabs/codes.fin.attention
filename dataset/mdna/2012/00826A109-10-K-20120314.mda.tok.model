item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing novel drugs to improve the treatment of serious and often life threatening conditions 
our product candidate  peginesatide  is for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease patients on dialysis 
the new drug application  or nda  for peginesatide is currently under review by the us food and drug administration  or fda 
we have a worldwide collaboration to develop and commercialize peginesatide with takeda pharmaceutical company limited  or takeda  the largest pharmaceutical company in japan  and plan to co commercialize peginesatide in the us  if approved by the fda 
anemia is a serious condition in which blood is deficient in red blood cells and hemoglobin 
it is common in patients with chronic kidney disease  cancer  heart failure  inflammatory diseases and other critical illnesses  as well as in the elderly 
if left untreated  anemia may lead to chronic fatigue or increase the risk of other diseases or death 
currently  recombinant epo  or repo  is used to treat anemia due to chronic kidney disease in patients on dialysis and not on dialysis  and to treat chemotherapy induced anemia in cancer patients 
we estimate that repo generated approximately billion of net revenues in the united states  or us  for attributable to use in dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease 
peginesatide is a synthetic peptide based erythropoiesis stimulating agent  or esa  designed to stimulate production of red blood cells 
peginesatide is designed to be longer acting than currently marketed esas in the us for dialysis patients  and therefore has the potential to offer reduced cost and complexity for healthcare providers 
in late june  we announced preliminary top line results from our peginesatide phase clinical program for the treatment of patients with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease 
our phase clinical program included four open label  randomized controlled clinical trials 
of these trials  two trials  called pearl and pearl  were conducted in non dialysis patients and designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of peginesatide compared to darbepoetin alfa to correct anemia and maintain hemoglobin in a corrected range over time 
the other two trials  called emerald and emerald  were conducted in dialysis patients and designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of peginesatide and its ability to maintain hemoglobin levels in a corrected range compared to epoetin alpha or epoetin beta when switched to peginesatide 
analysis of efficacy and safety for all of the phase studies were based on primarily assessments of non inferiority to the comparator drugs 
the primary efficacy endpoint  the mean change in hemoglobin from baseline  in each of the four phase studies met the statistical criteria for non inferiority 
in addition  peginesatide met the statistical criterion for non inferiority for the assessment of safety for the cardiovascular composite safety endpoint  or cse  which was composed of death  stroke  myocardial infarction  congestive heart failure  unstable angina and arrhythmia from a pooled safety database across the four phase studies 
however  some differences were observed when secondary analyses were conducted  including a difference in a subgroup analysis conducted in the pearl trials where the frequency of cse events was higher in the peginesatide group relative to the comparator in non dialysis patients  as previously described in our current report on form k dated june  in october  we met with the fda to discuss the regulatory path for peginesatide based on the initial analysis of the phase results 
based on these discussions with the fda  we submitted a nda for peginesatide to the fda for treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease patients on dialysis in may in july  the fda accepted our submission and filed the nda for review  with an action date of march  under the prescription drug user fee act 
in december  the fda oncologic drugs advisory committee  or odac  voted to  with abstention  that peginesatide demonstrated a favorable benefit risk profile for use in the treatment of dialysis patients with anemia due to chronic kidney disease 
while the fda is not bound by the recommendations of its 
table of contents advisory committees  their guidance will be considered by the fda in its review of the nda that was submitted for peginesatide despite meeting the primary efficacy endpoints and the cse for peginesatide  the differences observed in the phase secondary analyses present risks to our ability to obtain regulatory approval for peginesatide particularly in view of the heightened concerns surrounding safety of esas 
any negative perception of peginesatide s safety relative to other esas would significantly reduce the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval for peginesatide 
the phase results have caused significant delay and may negatively impact the likelihood of regulatory approval  and may significantly increase the likelihood of fda requirements  restrictions and conditions if regulatory approval is obtained 
for example  the odac discussed various measures  including a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  a postmarketing study and label restrictions  to assure safe use of peginesatide  including minimizing the risk of administration to non dialysis patients 
any or all of these factors may significantly reduce the ultimate commercial potential of peginesatide 
effective january   our former chief executive officer  arlene m 
morris  resigned from her position as well as from our board of directors 
as part of her separation agreement  ms 
morris was obligated to provide consulting services through september  under the terms of her severance arrangement  she received severance benefits in the form of cash  reimbursement of cobra premiums  continued vesting of existing stock based awards until september   and additional time to exercise vested stock based awards after september  we recorded  of expense in the quarter ended march  related to the severance and consulting arrangement with ms 
morris 
given the nature of the consulting arrangement  all costs were accrued and expensed in the quarter ended march  in march  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to the public at per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
in november  we entered into a settlement and license agreement  or the settlement and license agreement  with janssen biotech  inc a subsidiary of johnson johnson pharmaceutical research development  llc  or johnson johnson  and certain of its affiliated companies  or  collectively  janssen  under which we obtained from janssen a non exclusive license to the intellectual property in dispute  a covenant not to sue and a release of all claims associated with the arbitration and dispute 
the settlement and license agreement also provides for the dismissal of all pending proceedings 
the settlement and license agreement provides for fixed payments by us to janssen of million within days of execution thereof  which was paid in december  and million by june  the settlement and license agreement also provides for a million milestone payment to janssen upon fda regulatory approval of peginesatide  and a million milestone payment to janssen upon regulatory approval of peginesatide in the first major european country 
in addition  janssen will also be entitled to low  single digit royalties on sales of peginesatide in europe  japan and certain other countries outside of the united states until mid upon execution of the settlement and license agreement in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of research and development  or r d  expense relating to the fixed payments 
the milestone payments due upon regulatory approval will be capitalized when and if they become due and payable  and the resulting asset will be amortized over the period of expected benefit from the license granted in the settlement and license agreement 
concurrent with the execution of the settlement and license agreement  we and takeda entered into an amendment to our collaboration in connection with the above settlement payments to janssen 
under the terms of this amendment  takeda has agreed to pay us up to million in additional milestones in consideration of the upfront and milestone payments we are required to make to janssen 
table of contents under the settlement and license agreement 
million of these milestones are earned based on regulatory and commercial events in the us and the remaining million is tied to regulatory events in the european union or eu as of december   none of these milestones have yet been achieved and as such  we have not received any related payments from takeda 
in november  as contemplated under our arrangement  we and takeda executed a commercial active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  supply agreement which formalizes our respective responsibilities as they relate to the manufacture of peginesatide api by affymax and the purchase of that api by takeda for commercial manufacturing and sales of the product 
we are also responsible for the manufacture and supply of all quantities of api to be used in the development and commercialization of peginesatide worldwide 
takeda remains responsible for the fill and finish steps in the manufacture of peginesatide worldwide under the arrangement 
under the terms of the commercial api supply agreement  takeda has agreed to pay an aggregate of million in deposits for commercial api shipments of existing materials already manufactured by us 
through december   we have received million and shipped million of api 
the value of the api shipped to takeda has been recorded as deferred revenue 
the remainder of the amount paid by takeda has been recorded as a liability on our balance sheet 
in february  as contemplated under our collaboration  we and takeda entered into a co promotion agreement to further specify and formalize terms and conditions relating to the joint us commercialization activities for peginesatide including a corporate governance structure and division of roles and responsibilities between us and takeda  including deployment of resources 
we will deploy the sales force and the medical affairs field force but share marketing  account management and payer reimbursement related activities with takeda 
in addition  as we and takeda split profits in the us  the co promotion agreement provides further detail relating to the treatment of full time equivalent  or fte  expenses used to calculate eligible commercial expenses incurred thereunder 
consistent with the terms of the collaboration  takeda retains final decision making authority with respect to terms related to pricing and contracting and responsibility for distribution activities 
in february  the marketing authorization application  or maa filed by takeda in early was accepted  by the european medicines agency  or ema which triggered a million milestone payment from takeda 
we received this milestone payment in the first quarter of  and we expect to recognize it as revenue in the same period 
to date  we have not generated any product revenue 
we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  reimbursement for development expenses and api production  license fees and milestone payments from collaborative partners  operating and capital lease financings  interest earned on investments and limited license fees and royalties from licensing intellectual property 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
due to the recognition of revenues from milestone payments from takeda under the arrangement  we were profitable in the three and six months ended june  and may have profitable quarters from time to time if we are successful in obtaining fda approval for peginesatide 
we continue to expect to incur substantial losses in order to complete the development and commercialization of peginesatide 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments together with the interest thereon will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations for at least the next months 
however  further challenges or delays to approval and commercialization of peginesatide or significant commercialization costs may require us to raise additional funding to complete the development and commercialization of peginesatide 
since the announcement of our phase data in late june and the arbitration decision in october  we have experienced a severe decline in our stock price  which has reduced our ability to access capital on potentially favorable terms 
in contrast  our funding needs have only increased as the peginesatide development program has suffered delays  the potential loss of milestone payments from takeda associated with the non dialysis indication 
there can be no 
table of contents assurance we can raise the additional funds to support our continuing operations  maintain current regulatory timelines and successfully commercialize peginesatide if approved  and funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
our failure to raise capital if and when needed may harm our business and operating results 
our current view of the worldwide capital markets is that they are extremely volatile with limited accessibility  and many biotechnology companies have been limited or unsuccessful in obtaining funding in this environment 
we intend to evaluate the capital markets from time to time to determine whether to raise additional capital  in the form of equity or otherwise  depending upon market conditions relative to our need for funds at such time 
continuation of this market and the issues arising from our phase results could significantly limit our ability to raise funds such that there can be no assurance we can raise the additional funds to support our continuing operations and maintain current development timelines  and funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
further  in prior periods  we have reduced our research capabilities and efforts  including the elimination of certain research programs  and even some activities related to the support of peginesatide 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we could be required to further delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations  which could negatively impact our ability to complete development or commercialize peginesatide 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing would be difficult to obtain  if accessible at all  and our current stockholders may be significantly diluted 
any debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants or security interests in our assets 
further  any strategic or licensing arrangements  if available  may require us to relinquish product rights that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
research and development expenses r d expenses consist of i expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations and investigative sites  which conduct a substantial portion of our pre clinical studies and all of our clinical trials  ii payments to contract manufacturing organizations  which produce our api  iii payments to consultants  iv license fees paid to third parties for use of their intellectual property  v employee related expenses  which include salaries and related costs  and vi facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and equipment  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
all r d expenses are expensed as incurred 
for our r d expenses  we have historically commenced tracking the costs for a project when we are working with another company or when the product candidate merits substantial increase in the level of effort 
in recent years  our r d efforts have been almost exclusively focused on the development of peginesatide  specifically on the phase trials commenced in during the commercialization period  which commenced in june after the submission of our nda to the fda  takeda bears responsibility for of all third party expenses related to us development and of all third party expenses related to the commercialization of peginesatide in the us certain employee related expenses supporting preparation for commercialization of peginesatide in the us are also shared equally 
such employee related costs will include the cost of certain employees that would be required to commercialize the product such as field sales representatives  sales operations  medical science liaisons  nurse educators  conversion specialists  national accounts managers and reimbursement specialists 
in addition  costs of employees in clinical  regulatory and other development functions supporting any post marketing development activity required by the fda or separately agreed to by the parties in the us are shared equally 

table of contents the process of conducting pre clinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
the probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the product candidate s early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
while we are currently focused on developing peginesatide  in the future we may develop additional product candidates internally and in license product candidates  which would increase our r d expenses in later periods 
during the year ended december   we finalized amendments for certain clinical trial activities completed in in the fourth quarter of  we obtained final monitored site visit data and investigator contracts from our third party contract research organizations  or cros  that allowed us to complete our reconciliation of the significant majority of the labor and investigator costs incurred throughout the course of our clinical trials to our previously recorded estimates 
this data and contractual information was not available to us during the course of the trials 
after extensive analysis to cost out and analyze the information provided  we determined that the costs incurred were lower than our previously recorded estimates 
we believe these changes were only identifiable based on the information received in the fourth quarter of the change in estimate decreased expense by million for the year ended december  during the year ended december  we continued to work with our cros on final close out activities regarding site billings for investigator grants on our phase trials 
during the year  we received notification from both of our major cros that they had completed their close out work and they provided the final amounts due relating to work performed on our phase studies for which they were responsible 
as a result of this new information  we recorded a change in estimate to decrease our clinical trial accruals for these trials which resulted in a million reversal of our clinical trial accrual in the year ended december  in addition  as a result of the conclusion of negotiations with our cros on various billing disputes  we further reduced our clinical trial accrual by million as the ultimate settlement was more favorable than our initial estimates 
the aggregate change in estimate during the period decreased expense by million for the year ended december  additional changes in estimate or adjustments could result in the future as we have ongoing clinical trial activity on our phase b trial  and a phase study in pure red cell aplasia  or prca patients and such adjustments could impact r d expense and collaboration revenue and amounts due to or from takeda in subsequent periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in commercial  medical affairs  executive  finance  accounting  business and commercial development  information technology  legal and human resources functions 
other sg a expenses include costs to prepare for marketing  commercial and medical affairs support of peginesatide if approved by the fda  as well as facility costs not otherwise included in r d expense  patent filing  prosecution and defense costs and professional fees for legal  consulting  auditing and tax services 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition and clinical development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition collaboration revenue we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  staff bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin  or sab no 
 revision of topic and accounting standards codification  or asc   multiple element arrangements 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined in the authoritative guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
application of this guidance requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the fair value of the individual elements and whether such elements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship 
on january   we adopted accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this update amends the guidance on accounting for arrangements with multiple deliverables to require that each deliverable be evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting 
this determination is generally based on whether the deliverable has stand alone value to the customer 
this update also establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining how to allocate arrangement consideration to identified units of accounting 
the selling price used for each unit of accounting will be based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  if available  third party evidence if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
we may be required to exercise considerable judgment in determining whether a deliverable is a separate unit of accounting and the estimated selling price of identified units of accounting for new agreements 
the adoption of asu no 
did not impact our financial position or results of operations as of and for the year ended december  the potential future impact of the adoption of this update will depend on the nature of any new arrangements or material modifications of existing arrangements that we enter into in the future 
during the development period under the arrangement  which ended in may upon the submission of our nda to the fda  we recognized collaboration revenue using the contingency adjusted performance model  or capm 
under capm  revenue is eligible for recognition in the period the payment is earned under the arrangement including amounts that are either received or due from takeda 
revenue initially recognized is based on the percentage of time elapsed from inception of the arrangement in june to the period in which the payment is earned in relation to the total projected development period 
the remaining portion of the payment is then recognized on a 
table of contents straight line basis over the remaining estimated duration of the development period of the arrangement 
payments during the development period included amounts due for upfront license fees  milestone payments earned  purchases of api and reimbursement of development expenses 
in exchange for these payments  we continued to actively develop our compound for the treatment of anemia for chronic kidney disease through the end of the development period which occurred upon our submission of our nda  beginning in june  we have moved into the commercialization period as defined under our arrangement with takeda 
according to the arrangement  this includes all activities undertaken before and after regulatory approval relating specifically to pre commercialization services such as pre marketing  launch  promotions  marketing  sale and distribution of peginesatide as well as development work that has taken place after our nda has been filed with the fda but before peginesatide receives fda approval 
prior to approval of the product and commencement of profit sharing payments  our primary source of revenue during the commercialization period will likely consist of takeda s reimbursement of our pre commercialization and development efforts including cost of internal and external activities 
for example  this includes work to prepare materials and other costs to present to the fda odac and costs to implement and maintain a drug safety database 
in addition to the reimbursement of the services described above  the arrangement provides us the potential to earn at risk milestone payments upon achievement of contractual criteria 
during the commercialization period  our obligations include ongoing regulatory work to obtain fda approval and commercial efforts related to our product launch 
any post development activities incurred during the commercialization period is related to activities to obtain fda approval after our nda was filed and activities for commercial readiness in anticipation of fda approval and product launch 
during the commercialization phase  we have re evaluated the deliverables to be performed under the arrangement to determine if the deliverables can be treated as separate units of accounting 
we continue to follow the guidance of asc to determine whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
to determine if a delivered item can be treated as a separate unit of accounting  we evaluate if the delivered item has value to takeda on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item s and if a general right of return exists for the delivered item eg 
contingencies  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and is substantially within the control of the company 
for each source of collaboration revenue  we apply the following revenue recognition model revenues related to reimbursements by takeda of third party development expenses split per the arrangement and commercial expenses shared equally according to the arrangement are recognized as revenue  in the period the related costs are incurred 
revenues related to reimbursement of costs of ftes engaged in development related activities such as post marketing studies  are recognized as revenue in the period the related costs are incurred 
such reimbursement is based on contractually negotiated reimbursement rates for each fte as specified in the arrangement 
payments received from the shipment of commercial api prior to the launch of the product are recorded as deferred revenue as the earning process is not complete until either the finished goods produced from each batch of api are sold and utilized for commercial purposes post approval and charged back to us through the profit sharing each period or the arrangement has been terminated by takeda or us 

table of contents we account for milestones under asu no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition 
under the milestone method  contingent consideration received from the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved  which we believe is more consistent with the substance of our performance under the collaboration 
a milestone is defined as an event i that can only be achieved based in whole or in part on either the entity s performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved  and iii that would result in additional payments being due to the entity 
a milestone is substantive if the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone is consistent with our performance required to achieve the milestone or the increase in value to the collaboration resulting from our performance  relates solely to our past performance  and is reasonable relative to all of the other deliverables and payments within the collaboration 
license and royalty revenue royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with contract terms  when third party results are reported and collectability is reasonably assured 
royalties received under agreements that were acquired by us in the spin out from glaxosmithkline or glaxo are recorded net of the that we are required to remit to glaxo 
clinical trial expense and accruals we record expense for external costs incurred on our clinical studies based on our estimates of the costs incurred each period 
these clinical trial costs  which represent a significant component of r d expenses  were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our clinical trials are administered by cros for our phase and phase clinical studies  who typically perform most of the total start up activities for the trials  including document preparation  site identification pre study visits  training as well as on going program management 
there is a significant degree of estimation involved in quantifying the clinical study expenses due to the complexity and magnitude of the clinical trial activities 
these estimates have been subject to frequent adjustments  especially for our phase trials  in part due to our negotiations with third parties with respect to timing of reporting  patient progression and payments as well as our continuing negotiations with cros on timely delivery and access to information necessary to validate our accruals 
during the year ended december   we finalized amendments for certain clinical trial activities completed in which decreased expense by million for the year ended december  due to a change in estimate  as more fully described above in the research and development expenses section 
during the year ended december   we have continued to work with our cros on final close out activities regarding site billings for investigator grants on our phase trials 
during the year  we received notification from both of our major cros that they had completed their close out work and they provided the final amounts due relating to work performed on our phase studies for which they were responsible 
as a result of this new information  we recorded a change in estimate to decrease our clinical trial accruals for these trials which resulted in a million reversal of our clinical trial accrual in the year ended december  in addition  as a result of the conclusion of negotiations with our cros on various billing disputes  we further reduced our clinical trial accrual by million as the ultimate settlement was more favorable than our initial estimates 
the aggregate change in estimate during the period decreased expense by million for the year ended december  
table of contents additional changes in estimate or adjustments could result in the future as we have ongoing clinical trial activity on our phase b trial  and a phase study in prca patients and such adjustments could impact r d expense in subsequent periods 
stock based compensation we currently use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited and the expected life of the stock based payment awards 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock or restricted stock units  or rsus  market quotes are not available for long term  non transferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
we base our estimated expected option term and volatility on the realized volatilities of our peer companies 
the expected option term also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under the authoritative guidance for share based payments 
our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
the authoritative guidance for share based payments requires that employee stock based compensation costs be recognized over the requisite service period  or the vesting period  in a manner similar to all other forms of compensation paid to employees 
the allocation of employee stock based compensation costs to each operating expense line are estimated based on specific employee headcount information at each grant date and estimated stock option forfeiture rates and revised  if necessary  in future periods if actual employee headcount information or forfeitures differ materially from those estimates 
in determining whether an award is expected to vest  we use an estimated forward looking forfeiture rate 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards and historical experience 
these estimates are revised in subsequent periods based upon changes in facts or circumstances that would affect our forfeiture rate 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different than what was recorded in the current period 
for awards with a longer vesting period  the actual forfeiture rate and related expense may not be known for a longer period of time  which can result in more significant accounting adjustments once the awards are either vested or forfeited 
as a result  the amount of employee stock based compensation costs we recognize in each operating expense category in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 

table of contents we record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
the guidance prescribes a minimum recognition threshold and measurement process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our financial statements  although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 
we had million  million  and million of unrecognized tax benefits as of december    and  respectively 
we experienced ownership changes  as defined by sections and of the internal revenue code which establishes an annual limit on the deductibility of pre ownership change net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
as a result of the ownership change and underlying annual limitation  some of our pre ownership change net operating loss and all of our pre ownership change credit carryforwards will expire unutilized 
accordingly  we have reduced our gross deferred tax asset related to the expiring carryforwards by million as of december  at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  after taking into consideration the annual section limitation 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in  if not utilized 
at december  and  our liability for uncertain income tax positions was million and million  respectively  and is reflected as long term income tax liabilities on our balance sheet 
our policy is to include penalties and interest expense related to income taxes as a component of other expense and interest expense  respectively  as necessary 
for the years ended december    and  we recognized   and  respectively  of interest expense related to our liability for uncertain income tax positions 
for the years ended december   and  there were no penalties related to uncertain income tax positions 
at december  and   and  was accrued for interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions 
we do not anticipate that any of the unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly over the next twelve months 
restructuring charges as a result of the may amendment to our operating lease  we took possession of approximately  square feet of additional office space adjacent to our corporate headquarters in palo alto  california in may during the year ended december   management concluded that we would not occupy this additional office space  and we are actively seeking to sublease this space 
given these plans and the fact that this space is adequately separable from our existing facilities  in the second and fourth quarter of  we recorded total restructuring charges of  which represents the present value of the estimated future facility costs for which we will obtain no future economic benefit over the term of our lease  net of estimated future sublease income 
the  charge  as well as  of accretion was recorded during the year ended december  in selling  general and administrative or sg a expenses in the statement of operations 
the estimates underlying the fair value of the lease related restructuring liability involve significant assumptions regarding the time required to contract with a subtenant  the amount of space we may be able to sublease  the range of potential future sublease rates and the level of leasehold improvements expenditures that we may incur to sublease the property 
we have evaluated a number of potential sublease scenarios with differing assumptions and have probability weighted these scenarios and calculated the present value of cash flows based on management s judgment 
we will continue to 
table of contents monitor and update the liability balance when future events impact our cash flow estimates related to this excess space  which could result in additional restructuring charges in the future 
in august  we initiated a restructuring plan to lower annual operating expenses that included a planned reduction in force of positions 
as a result  we recorded a restructuring charge in the year ended december  of  related to severance and benefits  of which  was reflected as r d expense and  as sg a expense in the statement of operations 
the following table summarizes the accrual balance and utilization by type for the restructuring in thousands facilities related employee related total balance as of january  restructuring charges accrued cash payments accretion balance at december  less current portion long term portion as of december  results of operations revenue revenue and percentage changes as compared to prior years are as follows in thousands year ended december  percent change collaboration revenue license and royalty revenue total revenue we recognized million  million  and million of collaboration revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
collaboration revenue includes reimbursement payments from takeda that are calculated as our expenses eligible for reimbursement from takeda  net of takeda s own eligible expenses 
the decrease in collaboration revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  and for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to a reduction in overall research and development costs eligible for reimbursement under our collaboration with takeda as we completed our phase clinical trials in early collaboration revenue for the year ended december  was also impacted by our change in estimate adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of related to our clinical trial expense which reduced revenue by million 
these decreases were partially offset by milestone payments received from takeda in and during the year ended december   we received a million cash milestone payment from takeda for acceptance for review of our nda by the fda in the third quarter of for the year ended december   we received a million milestone payment from takeda for the initiation of japan s phase renal indication in march and million in milestone payments for the database lock of our non dialysis and dialysis phase trials in the second quarter of we expect collaboration revenue to be directly affected by milestone payments and expenses that are eligible for reimbursement from takeda under the arrangement in future periods 

table of contents collaboration revenue consists of net reimbursement of development and commercial expenses  milestone payments and purchases of api 
during the development period under the arrangement with takeda  which ended upon the submission of our nda to the fda for review  collaboration revenue was recognized using capm 
as a result  any payments from takeda under the arrangement were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the estimated development period 
beginning june  we have moved into the commercialization period where we now generally recognize revenue in the period earned as outlined in our revenue recognition policy in critical accounting policies significant judgments and estimates 
below is a summary of the components of our collaboration revenue for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  revenue recognized under capm expense reimbursement after capm milestone payments total collaboration revenue research and development expenses r d expenses and percentage changes as compared to prior years are as follows in thousands year ended december  percent change research and development expenses the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a reduced cro and investigative site costs as a result of the completion of the treatment and follow up of our phase clinical trials in early as well as due to a million reversal of r d expense due to a change in estimate in our clinical trial accrual related to final close out activities with both of our major cros on the phase studies 
during the year ended december  we continued to work with our cros on final close out activities regarding site billings for investigator grants on our phase trials 
we recently received notification from both of our major cros that they had completed their close out work and they provided the final amounts due relating to work performed on our phase studies for which they were responsible 
as a result of this new information  we recorded a change in estimate to decrease our clinical trial accruals for these trials which resulted in a million reversal of our clinical trial accrual in the year ended december  in addition  as a result of the conclusion of negotiations with our cros on various billing disputes  we further reduced our clinical trial accrual by million as the ultimate settlement was more favorable than our initial estimates 
the aggregate change in estimate during the period decreased expense by million for the year ended december  this decrease was partially offset by million of fixed payments related to the settlement and license agreement  costs related to our phase b study commenced in the third quarter and  in employee related restructuring costs related to a reduction in force incurred in the decrease in r d expenses for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the completion of the treatment and follow up of our phase clinical trials at the start of and a million reversal of r d expense due to a change in estimate in our clinical trial accrual related to our final reconciliation of investigator grants for our phase trials 
we expect r d expenses to continue to decrease in due to the completion of the treatment and follow up of our phase clinical trials in which decrease could be partially offset by any additional research and clinical trials conducted to obtain additional data for peginesatide

this decrease was partially offset by higher commercial expenses related to expansion of our commercial capabilities as we prepare for potential fda approval of peginesatide  a facilities related restructuring charge of  related to idle and excess office space  and increased employee compensation costs

for the years ended december  and  we recorded provisions for minimum statutory state tax and provided no federal tax as a result of our net operating loss 
for the year ended december   we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million 
the tax benefit was for federal tax purposes  primarily the result of the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of enacted in november  which allowed us to carryback our net operating loss to and recover million in alternative minimum taxes previously paid for the year ended december  we also recorded a  federal benefit related to refundable r d credits available to us pursuant to a provision within the housing assistance tax act of  which was effective for tax years ended after march  and december  as of december  and  we have a net deferred tax asset balance of million each  in consideration of the uncertainty in income taxes liability recorded for the same amount 
we considered the following positive and negative factors in determining that it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset as of december  and would be realized net deductible temporary differences that were expected to reverse in and  there were no relevant tax strategies available that we would consider feasible  and uncertainties  such as regulatory approval of peginesatide would adversely affect our future operations 
we have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we may incur continued losses in the future 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents  and investments at december  and were as follows in thousands year ended december  cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments since our inception  we have financed our operations through sale of capital stock  license fees  milestone payments and reimbursement for development and commercial expenses and manufacturing costs from collaborative partners  operating and capital lease financing  interest earned on investments and limited license fees and royalties from licensing intellectual property 
from inception through december   we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of equity 
table of contents securities  including million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock in a secondary public offering in march we also received million of upfront license fees  million in milestone payments and million for the reimbursement of development and commercial expenses and purchase of api from our arrangement with takeda 
takeda was responsible for the first million of third party expenses related to the development in pursuit of us regulatory approval of peginesatide  which was fully utilized by both parties through the first quarter of thereafter  takeda has borne of the third party us development expenses  while we have been responsible for of third party expenses 
during the development period  we retained responsibility for of our internal development expenses  most notably employee related expenses 
during the commercialization period  which commenced in june after the submission of our nda to the fda  takeda bears responsibility for of all third party expenses related to us development and of third party expenses related to the commercialization of peginesatide in the us certain employee related expenses supporting preparation for commercialization of peginesatide in the us are also shared equally 
such employee related costs will include the cost of certain employees that would be required to commercialize the product such as field sales representatives  sales operations  medical science liaisons  nurse educators  conversion specialists  national accounts managers and reimbursement specialists 
in addition  costs of employees in clinical  regulatory and other development functions supporting any post marketing development activity required by the fda or separately agreed to by the parties in the us are shared equally 
we are also entitled to a launch allowance to help fund the initial costs associated with preparing to launch the product in the us  whereby takeda will fund the first million of us commercial expenses 
the launch allowance is non refundable  however  in the event the product is approved for sale in the us  takeda is entitled to deduct up to of net sales from the profit share amounts which would have otherwise been due to us in each period until they have recouped an amount equal to million 
as a result of the potential reductions in profit sharing post launch stemming from the launch allowance  we have reflected amounts we receive under the terms of the launch allowance as a liability on our balance sheet 
as of december   we have received million of the launch allowance  which is reflected in the caption advance from takeda on the balance sheet 
in november  as contemplated under our arrangement  we and takeda executed a commercial api supply agreement which formalizes our respective responsibilities as they relate to the manufacture of peginesatide api by affymax and the purchase of that api by takeda for commercial manufacturing and sales of the product 
we are also responsible for the manufacture and supply of all quantities of api to be used in the development and commercialization of peginesatide worldwide 
takeda remains responsible for the fill and finish steps in the manufacture of peginesatide worldwide under the arrangement 
under the terms of the commercial api supply agreement  takeda has agreed to pay an aggregate of million in deposits for commercial api shipments of existing materials already manufactured by us 
through december   we have received million and shipped million of api 
the value of the api shipped to takeda has been recorded as deferred revenue 
the remainder of the amount paid by takeda has been recorded as a liability on our balance sheet 
in november  we entered into the settlement and license agreement with janssen  which requires us to make two fixed payments to janssen of million  which was paid in december  and million by june  the settlement and license agreement also requires us to make a million milestone payment to janssen upon fda regulatory approval of peginesatide  and a million milestone payment to janssen upon regulatory approval of peginesatide in the first major european country 
in addition  janssen will be entitled to royalties on sales of peginesatide in europe  japan and certain other countries outside of the united states until mid upon execution of the settlement and license agreement in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of r d  expense relating to the fixed payments 
the milestone payments due upon regulatory approval will be 
table of contents capitalized when and if they become due and payable  and the resulting asset will be amortized over the period of expected benefit from the license granted in the settlement and license agreement 
concurrent with the execution of the settlement and license agreement  we and takeda entered into an amendment to the arrangement in connection with the above settlement payments to janssen 
under the terms of this amendment  takeda has agreed to pay us up to million in additional milestones in consideration of the upfront and milestone payments to janssen under the settlement and license agreement 
million of these milestones are earned based on regulatory and commercial events in the us and the remaining million is tied to regulatory events in the eu we are solely responsible for the royalty payment to janssen 
as of december   none of these milestones have yet been achieved and as such  we have not received any related payments from takeda 
in  as contemplated under our arrangement  we and takeda entered into a co promotion agreement to further specify and formalize terms and conditions relating to the joint us commercialization activities for peginesatide including a corporate governance structure and division of roles and responsibilities between us and takeda  including deployment of resources 
we will deploy the sales force and the medical affairs field force but share marketing  account management and payer reimbursement related activities with takeda in addition  as we and takeda split profits in the us  the co promotion agreement provides further detail relating to the treatment of fte expenses used to calculate eligible commercial expenses incurred by the parties thereunder 
takeda retains final decision making authority with respect to terms related to pricing and contracting and responsibility for distribution activities 
in february  the marketing authorization application  or maa filed by takeda in early was accepted  by the ema which triggered a million milestone payment from takeda 
we received this milestone payment in the first quarter of  and we expect to recognize it as revenue in the same period net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december    and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
net cash used in operations for all periods reflects the benefit of reimbursement received from takeda for development and commercial expense and purchase of api by takeda 
the million increase in cash used in operating activities in as compared to was primarily due to a higher net loss in compared to the million decrease in cash used in operating activities in as compared to was primarily the result of a lower net loss in as compared to net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  and of million and million  respectively  was primarily a result of proceeds from maturities of investments offset by purchases of investments 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december of million was primarily a result of purchases of investments partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of investments 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to net proceeds of million received from our march public offering and proceeds received from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the million repayment of a loan from ubs financial services or ubs related to investments for which there was no market during the year  partially offset by million in net proceeds from a financing executed under our equity line of credit with azimuth during the years 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  reflects the net proceeds from two financings during the year  specifically million from the private placement in march and million of net proceeds from a public offering in november  as well as million in proceeds from the ubs loan in 
table of contents december the private placement also included warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at that are exercisable and expire in march in september we obtained an equity line of credit arrangement  with azimuth  that provides that  upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the purchase agreement  azimuth is committed to purchase up to million worth of shares of our common stock over the month term of the purchase agreement 
in september  we entered into an amendment  or the amendment  to the purchase agreement with azimuth which extends the term of the equity facility to september and reduces the minimum threshold price we may establish at which  upon presentation to azimuth of a draw down notice  azimuth is required to purchase shares of our common stock 
the amendment further provides that in no event may we sell under the purchase agreement more than such number of shares of common stock which is equal to one share less than of our outstanding shares of common stock on the effective date of the amendment 
our equity facility is subject to a number of conditions that limit our ability to draw against such facility 
for example  azimuth is not required to purchase our common stock when the price of our common stock is below per share 
in addition  azimuth is not obligated to purchase shares of our common stock which  when aggregated with all other shares of our common stock then owned beneficially by azimuth  would result in the beneficial ownership by azimuth of more than of the then issued and outstanding shares of our common stock 
at december   this represents  shares 
after deducting the shares purchased in october  assuming that all remaining  shares were sold at the closing price of our common stock at december  at the largest possible discount and assuming that azimuth still owns these shares  the maximum aggregate net proceeds we could receive under the agreement with azimuth would be approximately million 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of us government agencies  certificates of deposit  and money market funds 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy primarily with a focus on liquidity and capital preservation 
we believe that the existing cash  cash equivalents and investments together with the interest thereon will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations for at least the next months 
however  we may need to raise additional funding to complete the development and commercialization of peginesatide 
since the announcement of our phase data  we have experienced a severe decline in our stock price  which has reduced our ability to access capital on potentially favorable terms 
in contrast  our need to raise funding has only increased due to the peginesatide development program delays and the reduction of potential milestone payments from takeda associated with the non dialysis indication 
as we continue to develop and ultimately commercialize peginesatide  if approved  we may experience further challenges or delays to approval of peginesatide if issues arise or additional requirements are imposed based on our discussions with the fda and other regulatory authorities 
our current view of the worldwide capital markets is that they are extremely volatile with limited accessibility  and many biotechnology companies have been limited or unsuccessful in obtaining funding in this environment 
we intend to evaluate the capital markets from time to time to determine whether to raise additional capital  in the form of equity or otherwise  depending upon market conditions relative to our need for funds at such time 
continuation of this market may significantly limit our ability to raise funds such that there can be no assurance we can raise the additional funds to support our continuing operations and maintain current development timelines  and funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
further  in prior periods  we have reduced our research capabilities and efforts  including the elimination of certain research programs  and even some activities related to the support of peginesatide 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we could be required to further delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs 
table of contents and other operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing would be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
further  any strategic or licensing arrangements  if available  may require us to relinquish product rights that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
our future capital requirements will depend on many forward looking factors  and we expect to continue to spend substantial amounts in order to prepare to launch and commercialize peginesatide  including building our own commercial organization  sales force and infrastructure to address renal markets  prepare for the manufacturing process for peginesatide at our contract manufacturers for commercial launch  pursue approval of the nda for peginesatide through the fda review process  which is a lengthy and uncertain process  and complete clinical development of peginesatide  and any postmarketing requirements 
contractual obligations and significant commitments our future contractual obligations  including financing costs  at december  were as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations long term income tax liability total fixed contractual obligations relates primarily to minimum lease payments for lease of our facilities  consisting of approximately  square feet which expire in september with respect to our long term income tax liability as of december   we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
in april  we entered into a license  manufacturing and supply agreement with nektar therapeutics al  corporation  or nektar  under which we obtained from nektar a worldwide  non exclusive license  with limited rights to grant sublicenses  to certain intellectual property covering pegylation technology to manufacture  develop and commercialize peginesatide 
in consideration of the license grant  we agreed to pay royalties on the sales of peginesatide 
we also agreed to pay milestone payments totaling up to million  plus possible additional milestones in connection with our partnering activities relating to peginesatide or merger and acquisition activities 
in july  we paid nektar a million milestone payment triggered by the arrangement with takeda 
in august  we paid nektar a million milestone payment triggered by our acceptance by the fda of our nda submission for review 
under the agreement  we also engaged nektar for the manufacture and supply of our requirements of bulk poly ethylene glycol reagent for the manufacture of peginesatide 
this relationship is managed by a managing committee formed by representatives from both us and nektar 
nektar is obligated to engage a third party manufacturer in the event of nektar s failure as defined in 
table of contents the agreement to supply reagent 
this agreement expires  on a country by country basis  upon the expiration of our royalty payment obligations 
the agreement may be terminated by either party for the other party s material breach provided that such other party has been given a chance to cure such breach  or by nektar for our challenge of the validity or enforceability of any patents licensed thereunder 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued asu no 
 which is an update to topic  presentation of comprehensive income 
this update amends current comprehensive income guidance and eliminates the option of presenting the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity 
this update presents an entity with the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
the amendments in this update do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
the new guidance was originally proposed to be effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  and applied retrospectively 
in october  the fasb proposed to defer the effective date of certain provisions in the guidance related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
no effective date has been announced 
as asu no 
relates only to the presentation of comprehensive income  we do not expect that the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 which is an update to topic  fair value measurement 
this update establishes common requirements for measuring fair value and related disclosures in accordance with gaap and international financial reporting standards 
this amendment did not require additional fair value measurements 
asu no 
is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we do not believe there will be a significant impact on our financial statements from the adoption of asu no 
off balance sheet arrangements there were no significant off balance sheet arrangements at december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our goals  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
we do not believe that a decrease in interest rates would have a material negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio

at each quarter end  we may have liabilities for costs incurred by overseas suppliers of goods or services and clinical trial programs that are denominated in foreign currencies that are not hedged because of their relatively small size  uncertainty of payment date  and or short time until settlement 
an increase or decrease in exchange rates on these unhedged exposures may affect our operating results
