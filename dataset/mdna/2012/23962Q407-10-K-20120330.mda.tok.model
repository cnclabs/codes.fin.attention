item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operation and financial condition 
you should read this analysis in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related footnotes 
this discussion and analysis contains statements of a forward looking nature relating to future events or our future financial performance 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements  including those set forth in this annual report on form k 

table of contents overview we have developed a proprietary thin film deposition technology for solar photovoltaic pv products 
we utilize a proprietary one step sputter deposition process and have manufactured a commercial scale deposition tool to apply high efficiency copper indium gallium diselenide cigs material over large area glass substrates in a continuous fashion 
we believe this proprietary tool  when combined with commercially available thin film manufacturing equipment  can provide a critically differentiated manufacturing process to produce low cost monolithically integrated  cigs on glass modules that address the grid tied  ground based pv market 
we believe this proprietary deposition process  when operated at an annual capacity of approximately megawatts  may achieve a total module manufacturing cost of less than per watt 
this cost would be competitive with the lowest in the solar pv industry 
using this approach  we have achieved greater than cell efficiencies over large areas on cigs pv devices  and we believe that this approach will enable module efficiencies greater than 
we are currently pursuing strategic partnerships and investments to attempt to commercialize our product 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosures 
a summary of those accounting policies can be found in the notes to our financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require judgments on the part of management about matters that are uncertain 
we have identified the following accounting policies that are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
property and equipment 
property and equipment is stated at cost 
depreciation is computed using straight line and an accelerated method over estimated useful lives of three to ten years 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs  which do not materially extend the useful lives of property and equipment  are charged to operations as incurred 
when property or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of  the property accounts are relieved of costs and accumulated depreciation and any resulting gain or loss is recognized 
share based compensation 
we follow the provisions of fasb asc compensation stock compensation  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
additionally  we follow the sec s sab no 
 share based payment sab  as amended by sab no 
 which provides supplemental application guidance based on the views of the sec 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and certain reclassifications have been made to the financial information to conform to the presentation 
such reclassifications had no impact on net loss 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease reflects cost savings measures which resulted in lower costs for personnel  facilities  and materials and supplies  as well as a decrease of  in share based compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to cost savings measures  including a reduction in our workforce and outside consultants and professional fees  as well as a decrease of  in share based compensation 
restructuring 
restructuring expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the restructuring expenses in resulted from impairment charges on certain equipment  as we have cancelled orders for such equipment and settled the outstanding obligations with the vendors 
the settlement amounts of  which were paid in shares of our common stock were recorded as restructuring expense during the year ended december  these expenses were partially offset by the write off of certain liabilities during the year 
during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of  from the impairment of leasehold improvements and the write off of non cash deferred rent  upon closing our newark  california manufacturing facility 
additionally  we recorded impairment charges of  on certain equipment during the year ended december  
table of contents depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in depreciation reflects the reduction in leasehold improvements and certain equipment as we closed our newark  california manufacturing facility in interest expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase in interest expense was due to the increase in our outstanding notes issued in connection with our bridge financing  as well as interest expense on certain outstanding payables at december  amortization of note discount and financing costs 
amortization of note discount and financing costs was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the convertible notes issued in connection with our bridge financing contain conversion features as well as warrants which result in discounts to the principal amount of the notes payable reflected on our balance sheet  based on the fair value of the warrants and conversion features 
the discounts on the convertible notes are amortized using the effective interest method over the terms of the notes 
in the third quarter of  we restructured all of our existing convertible notes which resulted in the recording of new notes and corresponding discounts 
the expense for the year ended december  includes amortization of the discount on the original notes as well as a significant portion of the discount on the restructured notes 
the expense for the year ended december  reflects amortization of the discount on the notes issued in  as well as the remainder of the discount on the notes restructured in the majority of the discount on the notes restructured in was amortized to expense during the latter half of gain on derivative liabilities 
gain on derivative liabilities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the conversion features on the convertible notes issued in conjunction with our bridge financing are considered derivative liabilities and are therefore required to be adjusted to fair value each quarter 
a decrease in our stock price during the period results in a decrease in the liabilities and a gain on derivative liabilities 
conversely  an increase in our stock price during the period would result in an increase in the liabilities and a loss on derivative liabilities 
during the years ended december  and  our common stock price decreased which caused a decrease in the fair value of the conversion features and a gain on derivative liabilities 
additionally  in the third quarter of we restructured all of the then outstanding convertible notes which resulted in an increase in gain on derivative liabilities during the year ended december  loss on extinguishment of debt 
there was no loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended december  loss on extinguishment of debt was  for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we restructured all of our existing convertible notes which resulted in the extinguishment of the original notes on our balance sheet and the recording of new notes and corresponding conversion features 
the fair value of the conversion features for the restructured notes exceeded the principal amount of the notes and the excess of the fair value of the conversion features over the principal amount of the notes was charged to loss on extinguishment of debt 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled  compared to  at december  subsequent to december  and through march   we have received additional bridge financing of  to fund our operations 
we are in the development stage  and as such  have historically reported net losses  including a net loss of million for the year ended december  we anticipate incurring losses in the future  as we seek strategic partnerships and investments to commercialize our technology  and incur associated administrative and operating costs 
our financial statements for the years ended december  and have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
as noted herein  as a result of our current liquidity  there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have historically financed our operations primarily from proceeds of the sale of equity securities and the issuance of convertible notes 
we presently do not have any bank lines of credit that provide us with an additional source of debt financing 
we are currently seeking strategic partnerships and investments to attempt to commercialize our cigs technology utilizing our proprietary deposition equipment 
commercialization efforts  including continued development and administrative costs will require significant additional capital 

table of contents beginning in september  we have funded our operations through a series of bridge financing transactions in which we have issued convertible and traditional notes with an aggregate principal amount of million and also issued warrants exercisable for shares of our common stock 
currently  million of these notes remains outstanding 
in order to address our immediate capital requirements  in february  we entered into a securities purchase agreement with socius cg ii  ltd 
the investor or socius 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  we have the right over a term of two years  subject to certain conditions  to demand through separate tranche notices that the investor purchase up to a total of million of series b preferred stock 
however  in order to continue operations  including development and commercialization efforts  we will require substantial additional capital beyond our current cash on hand and any funds received from the socius transaction 
although we continue to seek strategic investors or partners  in light of our current cash position  we may in the near term be forced to cease or further curtail operations 
an inability to raise additional funding in the very near term may cause us to file a voluntary petition for reorganization under the united states bankruptcy code  liquidate assets  and or pursue other such actions that could adversely affect future operations 
a wide variety of factors relating to the company including those described in the section entitled risk factors in part i item a of this annual report on form k  as well as external conditions  could adversely affect our ability to secure additional funding necessary to continue operations and the terms of any funding that we secure 
commitments 
at december   we had no outstanding purchase orders for equipment and improvements 
other commitments include rental payments under operating leases for office space and equipment  and commitments under employment contracts with our executive officers 
these commitments are discussed further in the commitments and contingencies footnote to our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements 
the only off balance sheet obligations are for operating leases and certain other commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business 
we lease  square feet of warehouse and office space in union city  california under a lease which expires in june this facility is the location of our corporate headquarters as well as our development and proprietary deposition equipment
