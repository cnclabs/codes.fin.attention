item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve numerous risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including but not limited to those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
except as otherwise required by law  we do not intend to update any information contained in these forward looking statements 
overview general we are a leading national provider of proprietary technology and online marketing capabilities in the residential real estate brokerage industry 
for home buyers and sellers who increasingly demand control  choice and seamless  customized service  we offer internet enabled  state of the art technology and access to information that real estate professionals can combine with their own local knowledge and personal expertise to offer an exceptional start to finish experience to their clients 
for real estate professionals who seek more productive ways to conduct business in our fiercely competitive industry  we provide technology and online marketing tools to enhance their online sales channel  including the attraction  incubation and service of their clients 
our technology and online marketing products serve our full service  owned and operated residential real estate brokerage business  as well as our powered by zip network of leading third party local brokerages in select markets 
our website consistently receives more traffic than any other residential real estate brokerage in the nation  according to reports by hitwise  an information services company 
as of march   we had approximately million active registered users who had accessed our website within the last year 
we conduct our owned and operated brokerage in markets nationwide  all of which were opened prior to may baltimore  md  washington  dc  boston  ma  chicago  il  dallas  tx  los angeles  ca  orange county  ca  phoenix  az  sacramento  ca  san diego  ca  the san francisco bay area  ca  seattle  wa  las vegas  nv  houston  tx  orlando  fl  austin  tx  denver  co  richmond  va  westchester county long island  ny  and portland  or 
we have announced an agreement to transition our existing owned and operated brokerage business in a st market salt lake city  ut to a local brokerage that is joining our powered by zip network  and we expect to complete that transition shortly 
once that transition is complete  our powered by zip network will serve leading local brokerages in seven markets where we do not otherwise conduct business  including tucson  az  atlanta  ga  jacksonville  fl  raleigh durham  nc  the greater philadelphia area  pa  and nashville  tn 
the markets in our owned and operated brokerage and powered by zip network are served by over almost  local  licensed real estate agents  all of whom are independent contractors 
we derive the majority of our net revenues from commissions earned in our owned and operated brokerage representing buyers and sellers in residential real estate transactions 
we record commission revenues net of any commission discount  transaction fee adjustment or  when applicable  rebate 
net transaction revenues are principally driven by the number of transactions closed and the average net revenue per transaction 
average net revenue per transaction is a function of the home sales price and percentage commission received on each transaction and can vary significantly by market 
we also derive commission referrals from net commission earned by brokerages in our powered by zip network and we derive revenues from certain marketing arrangements with residential mortgage service providers  the sale of online marketing  lead referral fees and other revenues  for example  we receive marketing fees from a mortgage lender to whom we provide access through the mortgage center on our website  who pay us a flat marketing fee that is established on a periodic basis 
historically  non commission revenues represented less than of our net revenues during any period  although they have exceeded since the fourth quarter of due to relatively weak transaction revenues  as well as efforts to diversify our revenue stream 
we routinely explore opportunities to grow our non commission revenues through marketing and other business arrangements for offering services related to the purchase  sale and ownership of a home  and as we develop these opportunities  our non commission revenues may represent a greater percentage of our net revenues in future periods than historically 
recent changes in our business model conversion of agents to independent contractor model until  the real estate agents in our owned and operated brokerage business were typically employees 
in february  we began transitioning those agents to an independent contractor model in some of our markets  and we completed that transition in the remainder of our markets by january through this modified business model  we have empowered our local offices and real estate professionals to make decisions that are better tailored to the dynamics of their particular markets  with the goal of increasing productivity and customer service levels 
we have also minimized management oversight of day to day agent activities  thereby reducing costs for field sales support  corporate sales support and corporate administration 
restructuring and realignment in early  we restructured our business to heighten our focus on our core strengths in technology  online marketing and our most attractive local real estate markets 
to that end  we closed our offices in twelve markets in the first quarter of fresno central valley  ca  charlotte  sc  naples  fl  jacksonville  fl  miami  fl  palm beach  fl  tampa  fl  hartford  ct  minneapolis  mn  virginia beach  va  tucson  az  and atlanta  ga 
as we closed our offices in tucson and atlanta  we transitioned our local operations to third party brokerages in our powered by zip network  and after we closed our offices in jacksonville  we added a third party brokerage in that market to our powered by zip network  as discussed below 
we also reorganized local management responsibilities and significantly reduced our corporate sales support and administration  which encouraged greater local independence and efficiency  and which reduced our full year corporate expenses  excluding cost of revenue and certain one time charges  by about one third from in the fourth quarter of  we continued our restructuring by closing our offices in raleigh durham  nc  and the greater philadelphia area  pa  while transitioning our operations in those markets to our powered by zip network  and we are currently in the process of doing likewise in salt lake city  ut  all as discussed below 
we also began to realign our organization to operate more efficiently and to refocus our resources on the highest value priorities  including by combining our product and marketing functions  and by separating our brokerage operations from our technology and marketing functions 
we have created and are seeking a person to fill a new position president of brokerage operations to drive our owned and operated brokerage going forward 
introduction of powered by zip network in early  we began to build our powered by zip network with select third party local brokerages 
we have since transitioned our previous owned and operated brokerage business in the markets of tucson  az  atlanta  ga  raleigh durham  nc  and the greater philadelphia area  pa  to the third party brokers who have joined our powered by zip network 
we also service brokerages through our powered by zip network in the markets of jacksonville  fl  where we had ceased to conduct brokerage operations prior to the time we added that market to our network  and in the new market of nashville  tn 
we have announced an agreement to transition our existing owned and operated brokerage business in the market of salt lake city  ut  to a local brokerage that is joining our powered by zip network  and we expect to complete that transition shortly 
end of buyer rebates until recently  for home buyers in our owned and operated brokerage business  we typically shared of our commissions with them in the form of a cash rebate  where permitted by law 
on july   we announced that we were discontinuing our commission rebate program  although home buyers who entered into a contract to purchase a home by july   and who closed escrow on the transaction by august   remained eligible to receive the rebate  subject to certain additional restrictions 
by eliminating buyer rebates  we have focused consumer attention on our full service  technology enhanced customer service  as well as improved the financial productivity of real estate professionals in our owned and operated brokerage business 
we expect that the termination of our rebate program will increase our average net revenue per transaction  but it may negatively impact our transaction volume 
also  net revenue increases resulting from the termination of the rebate program may be offset by increases in our agent compensation programs 
we believe that the termination of our rebate program had a modest positive impact on our financial results for the second half of  and we expect it to continue to have a positive impact on our financial results for full year opening access to our website prior to  we imposed a user registration requirement on most of the mls data available on our website  whether or not required by local mls rules 
beginning in february  we began to open access to the mls information available on our website data by removing our user registration requirement to the extent not required by mls rules 
currently  in every market in our owned and operated brokerage  and in every market in our powered by zip network except tucson  az  consumers who come directly to our website are no longer required to register with us in order to view home prices  photos  maps  and other property listings details permitted under mls rules to be shown without registration 
through this open website  we seek to attract more consumers  rank higher within search engine results  improve the quality of the leads that ultimately choose to register on our website  better showcase the real estate professionals in our owned and operated brokerage and in our powered by zip network  and improve customer acquisition costs 
market conditions and trends in our business macroeconomic forces 
for the past few years  the residential real estate market has been negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions 
we believe that conditions such as tight lending criteria  high numbers of distressed properties  and high unemployment continue to exert negative pressure on the residential real estate market  and may continue to do so for some time  although demand for housing may have been bolstered in by historically low mortgage rates 
for the foreseeable future in  we currently believe that the health of the residential housing market will continue to be significantly affected by the availability of credit  shadow inventory levels  and interest rates  as well as any significant change in unemployment levels 
we cannot predict any changes in those macroeconomic forces  nor can we predict the combined impact of those changes on the residential real estate market 
speed of foreclosures 
in late  concern grew that mortgage lenders were possibly not fulfilling all the legal requirements for valid foreclosure proceedings  as regulators began investigating mortgage lending practices  banks began processing foreclosures more cautiously 
although a settlement  subject to court approval  has been reached between the federal government and five of the country s largest banks concerning their mortgage lending practices  regulators may continue to pursue legal action against these and other banks 
it is presently unclear what impact this settlement and future regulatory activity will have on foreclosure activities by banks 
we cannot predict the pace at which banks will process their foreclosure pipelines and what impact  if any  this situation will have on the residential real estate market 
federal action 
the federal government  state governments and related agencies have acted repeatedly to address the decline in the residential real estate market and the availability of home mortgage credit 
some of those efforts  such as the federal first time home buyer tax credit  which is discussed below under fluctuations in quarterly profitability  temporarily boosted home sales in earlier periods  but often by accelerating home purchase decisions from later periods  not by creating new housing demand 
when such programs ended  the residential real estate market was left once again to suffer the pressures of poor macroeconomic conditions 
in addition  the federal housing and economic recovery act of sought to ease the tightness in mortgage lending in certain higher priced markets by increasing the cap on loans guaranteed by federally insured mortgage programs under fannie mae  freddie mac  the federal housing administration and the veterans administration from a maximum of  to a maximum of  this increase expired on october  in november  a federal law reinstated the expired higher loan limits for loans guaranteed by the federal housing administration and the veterans administration  but not for loans guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac 
the expiration of the higher loan limits for loans guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac may negatively impact the availability of mortgages and the housing market in certain higher priced markets 
also  federal regulators have acted to discourage risky home mortgage lending practices 
for example  under the dodd frank wall street reform act  federal regulators must develop rules to require lenders to retain of the risk in the mortgages they originate  other than qualified residential mortgages  also known as qrms  and other than mortgages that are backed by federally insured mortgage programs 
mortgages that do not meet these exemptions could carry higher interest rates or be less available to home buyers  which could dampen the housing market  particularly if the definition of a qrm is drawn narrowly 
it is too soon to tell what the final rules will require and what impact they will have on the residential real estate market 
to the extent that governments and related agencies take future actions to address the residential real estate market or the home mortgage market  there can be no assurance that those activities will have a positive  meaningful and lasting impact on either market  or that they will not result in unintended consequences 
current residential real estate market conditions 
recent indicators of national residential real estate market conditions include the following volume according to the national association of realtors  or nar  existing home sales nationwide in the fourth quarter of were up year over year  with volume increases in all major regions of the country 
those increases may have been due  in part  to the negative impact in the fourth quarter of of the expiration of the federal first time home buyer tax credit  which is discussed below under fluctuations in quarterly profitability  and the market continues to be impacted by the lingering economic pressures discussed above 
price according to nar  in the fourth quarter of  the national median existing home sales price decreased by year over year  with price decreases in all major regions of the country 
we perceive that overall prices continue to be negatively impacted by the tight lending criteria for non conforming jumbo loans and the resulting constriction of the market for higher priced homes 
inventory according to nar  in the fourth quarter of  the inventory levels of existing homes decreased by year over year 
we are unable at the present time to tell what impact  if any  the foreclosure processing delays instituted by many major mortgage lenders will have on future inventory levels 
distressed properties currently  a significant percentage of our sales transaction volume is composed of distressed properties 
distressed properties are homes that are in foreclosure  are bank owned or reo  or are short sales  meaning a sale where the sale price is less than the loans or debt secured by the home listed for sale 
in the fourth quarter of  the percentage of our sales transactions composed of distressed properties in our owned and operated markets was approximately  which was essentially flat year over year for those same markets 
distressed properties not only tend to sell at reduced prices  but they also tend to put downward pressure on the values of other homes for sale in the same and nearby neighborhoods 
we expect distressed properties to continue to represent a significant portion of the residential real estate market and of our business for the foreseeable future 
shadow inventory shadow inventory refers to distressed and other properties that have not yet been listed for sale  as well as properties that homeowners wish to sell  but will not sell at current market prices 
shadow inventory can occur when lenders put reo properties properties that have been foreclosed or forfeited to lenders on the market gradually  rather than all at once  or delay the foreclosure process 
they may choose to do so because of regulations and foreclosure moratoriums  because of the additional costs and resources required to process and sell foreclosed properties  or because they want to avoid depressing housing prices further by putting many distressed properties up for sale at the same time 
it is difficult to assess the current volume of shadow inventory and its future impact on the residential real estate market  particularly given the uncertainty surrounding the foreclosure processing delays instituted by many major mortgage lenders  discussed above 
fluctuations in quarterly profitability 
we have experienced fluctuations in profitability from period to period 
our profitability has been impacted by various factors  including ongoing market challenges  government intervention  seasonality  and  in previous years  new market expansion and legal settlements 
for example  in  the federal government introduced a program to provide a tax credit of up to  to first time home buyers  meaning buyers who had not owned a home in the preceding three years  and a tax credit of up to  to repeat home buyers  meaning buyers who had lived in their current homes for five consecutive years in the past eight years 
to take advantage of the program  buyers must have entered into a home purchase contract by april   and must have completed the purchase by september  we believe that this program had a positive effect on home sales volume in and the first half of  particularly in the second quarter of however  we also believe that the program accelerated the decision to purchase a home for some buyers  which resulted in fewer sales in the second half of  and possibly later 
accordingly  during the first half of  the year over year comparison in sales volume was distorted negatively by the positive impact of the federal tax credit program during the first half of conversely  in the second half of  the year over year comparison in sales volume was distorted positively by the negative impact during the second half of of the expiration of the federal tax credit program 
industry seasonality and cyclicality 
the residential real estate brokerage market is influenced both by seasonal factors and by overall economic cycles 
while individual markets vary  transaction volume nationally tends to increase progressively from january through the summer months  then to slow gradually over the last three to four months of the calendar year 
revenues in each quarter are significantly affected by activity during the prior quarter  given the typical to day time lag between contract execution and closing for traditional home purchases 
for non traditional sales  the time lag from contract execution to closing can be longer 
we have been  and believe we will continue to be  influenced by overall market activity and seasonal forces 
we generally experience the most significant impact in the first and fourth quarters of each year  when our revenues are typically lower relative to the second and third quarters as a result of traditionally slower home sales activity and reduced listings inventory between thanksgiving and presidents day 
the impact of seasonality can be masked by the general health of the residential real estate market at any given point in time  whether affected by macroeconomic events such as the federal tax credit program discussed above  periodic business cycles or other factors 
generally  when economic conditions are fair or good  the housing market tends to perform well 
if the economy is weak  if interest rates dramatically increase  if mortgage lending standards tighten  or if there are disturbances such as terrorist attacks or threats  the outbreak of war or geopolitical uncertainties  the housing market likely would be negatively impacted 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and of those policies  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we derive the majority of our net revenues from commissions earned in our owned and operated residential real estate brokerage  and from commission referrals earned from brokers in our powered by zip network 
we recognize commission based revenues upon closing of a sale and purchase transaction  net of any rebate  commission discount or transaction fee adjustment 
these transactions typically do not have multiple deliverable arrangements 
non commission based revenues are derived primarily from marketing agreements with residential mortgage service providers  the sale of online advertising  lead referral fees and other revenues 
we classify these revenues as marketing and other revenues 
marketing service revenues are recognized over the term of the agreements as the contracted services are delivered 
advertising revenues on contracts are recognized as impressions are delivered or as clicks are provided to advertisers 
advertising and marketing contracts may consist of multiple deliverables which generally include a blend of various impressions or clicks as well as other marketing deliverables 
revenues related to revenue sharing arrangements are recognized based on revenue reports received from our partners  provided that collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence an arrangement exists  the service has been delivered and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
internal use software and website development costs we account for internal use software and website development costs  including the development of our ziprealty agent platform  or zap  in accordance with the guidance set forth in the related accounting standards 
we capitalize internal costs consisting of payroll and direct payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the development of internal use software  as well as any external direct costs 
we amortize these costs over their estimated useful lives  which typically is months 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs  and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized 
the estimated life is based on management s judgment as to the product life cycle 
stock based compensation we follow the provisions of accounting standards for share based payments  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees  consultants and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases  based on estimated fair values 
under the fair value recognition provisions of the accounting standards  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and recognized as expense using the straight line method over the requisite service period of the award 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  which incorporates various assumptions including volatility  expected life and interest rates 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the expected life of options is estimated by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option 
we estimate expected forfeitures based on various factors including employee class and historical experience 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates are revised 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws  the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense or benefit is the tax payable or refundable  respectively  for the period adjusted for the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the accounting guidance for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent historical results and our expectations for the future 
historically  we have recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  the majority of which relate to net operating loss carryforwards and we maintain that a full valuation allowance should be accounted for against our net deferred tax assets at december  restructuring costs in connection with our cost reduction initiatives  we record restructuring charges for employee termination costs  costs related to leased facilities to be abandoned or subleased  fixed asset impairments and other exit related costs 
formal plans are developed and approved by management 
restructuring costs related to employee severance and related expenses are recorded when probable and estimable 
fixed assets impaired as a result of restructuring are typically accounted for as assets held for sale or are abandoned 
the recognition of restructuring charges requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing  and costs associated with the planned restructuring activity  including estimating sublease income and the fair value  less selling costs  of fixed assets being disposed of 
estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring us to record additional restructuring charges or to reduce or reverse the amount of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued liabilities to ensure their adequacy  that no excess accruals are retained and that the utilization of the provisions is for the intended purpose in accordance with the approved restructuring plan 
in the event circumstances change and the provision is no longer required  the provision is reversed 
litigation we are involved in legal proceedings on an ongoing basis 
based upon our evaluation and consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and an analysis of potential results  we accrue for losses related to litigation if we determine that a loss is probable and it can be reasonably estimated 
if only a range of estimated losses can be determined  then we record an amount within the range that  in our judgment  reflects the most likely outcome  if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount  we record the low end of the range 
any such accrual is charged to expense in the appropriate period 
we record litigation expenses in the period in which the litigation services were provided

transactions closed during the period on a same market basis were  compared to  last year  a decrease of  or 
we believe the decrease in same market transaction volume was attributable to the impact of changes in our business model involving the conversion of our agents to independent contractors as well as continued weak economic conditions  reduced availability of mortgage financing and high unemployment 
same market average net revenue per transaction for the period was  compared to  last year  an increase of or 
we discontinued our commission rebate program during late summer resulting in lower cash rebates paid during the year which increased average net revenue per transaction in by approximately this increase was partially offset by the impact of lower average homesale prices  which decreased average net revenue per transaction by approximately average net revenue per transaction in continued to be impacted by a combination of market factors that also impacted  including overall decreases in housing prices from previous years  the impact of foreclosure  bank real estate owned reo and short sale transactions  typically at further reduced sales prices and ongoing reduced availability of consumer mortgage financing that particularly impacted the sale of higher priced housing 
the increase in marketing and other revenues for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was attributable to increased transaction referrals  principally from brokers in our powered by zip network of million and advertising income of million  offset by decreases in lead generation fees of million 
we expect our net revenues to decrease in compared to net transaction revenues are expected to decrease in due to a reduction in the number of transactions closed  resulting from markets closed or transitioned to our powered by zip network during  and from ongoing pressure on the real estate market in our owned and operated brokerage business 
average net revenue per transaction is expected to increase primarily as a result the termination of our commission rebate program

cost of revenues during the quarter ended march   we completed the transition of our agent force from an employee model to an independent contractor model 
under the employee model  our cost of revenues consisted principally of commissions  payroll taxes  benefits including health insurance  performance and tenure based award programs and agent expense reimbursements 
under the independent contractor model  our cost of revenues consists principally of commissions and related costs 
agent commissions are generally paid on net transaction revenues plus referral and other revenues generated by our agents 
year ended december  increase percent decrease change in thousands cost of revenues same markets    closed markets    total    the decrease in cost of revenues for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily related to the overall decrease in net revenues on which we pay agent commissions 
same market cost of revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  agent commissions decreased by approximately million or 
agent performance and tenure based programs  benefits and expense reimbursements decreased by approximately million or attributable to the transition of our agents to independent contractors who do not qualify for benefits and expense reimbursements and to the elimination of performance and tenure based programs as a component of agent compensation 
same market cost of revenues as a percentage of net transaction revenues was in compared to in we expect our cost of revenues will decrease in  compared to  because of the expected decrease net transaction revenues

this decrease may be offset by increased legal expenses attributable to current legal proceedings 
restructuring charges  net year ended december  increase percent decrease change in thousands restructuring charges  net   during the year ended december   we implemented a cost reduction initiative  including closing brokerage operations in fourteen markets and reducing our workforce in the remaining market brokerage operations as well as in our corporate sales support and administrative functions 
the restructuring charges include lease obligation costs and other non cash charges relating to lease terminations of approximately million and severance pay and related expenses of approximately million 
adjustments to non cash stock based compensation expense resulting from expense reversals for unvested stock awards that were forfeited were not significant 
at december   the aggregate outstanding restructuring liability was approximately million  most of which relates to non cancelable lease costs we expect to pay over the remaining term of the leases  which end by the third quarter of some expenses required estimates  particularly those related to our ability and the timing of generating sublease income and terminating lease obligations  and may require future adjustments to the amount of the restructuring charge recorded

year ended december  increase percent decrease change in thousands interest income interest income fluctuates as our cash equivalents and short term investment balances change and applicable interest rates increase or decrease 
the decrease in interest income for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was due primarily to lower interest rates earned on lower average balances 
the lower interest rates were primarily attributable to overall decreases in market interest rates combined with maintaining higher money market account balances yielding lower interest rates as we decreased our short term investments positions 
the lower average balances were primarily attributable to cash used in our operating activities as a result of the losses incurred during the year

the decrease in interest income for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was due primarily to lower interest rates earned on lower average balances 
the lower interest rates were primarily attributable to overall decreases in market interest rates combined with maintaining higher money market account balances yielding lower interest rates as we decreased our short term investments positions 
the lower average balances were primarily attributable to cash used in our operating activities as a result of the losses incurred during the year 
provision for income taxes year ended december  increase percent decrease change in thousands provision for benefit from income taxes the change in our income tax between and is principally related to the carryback of net operating losses nol in during  we elected to extend the carryback period and applied for refund of us alternative minimum tax remitted in and  resulting in thousand of income tax benefit recognized in there is no provision benefit for federal or state income taxes for the tax year ended december  because we incurred an operating loss for that year and established a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity for are our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of december  and  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at fair value of million and million  respectively 
we had no bank debt  line of credit or equipment facilities at december  and operating activities our operating activities used cash in the amount of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively

cash used in the year ended december  resulted primarily from a net loss million partially offset by million of depreciation and amortization  million of non cash stock based compensation expense and net changes in working capital 
our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of our net commission income from escrow companies or similar intermediaries in the real estate transaction closing process offset by cash payments for agent commissions and related costs as well as for product development  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs including employee compensation  benefits  client acquisition costs and other operating expenses 
due to the structure of our commission arrangements  our accounts receivable are settled in cash on a short term basis and our accounts receivable balances at period end have historically been significantly less than one month s net revenues

in the future  our ability to make significant capital investments may depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to obtain adequate financing  if necessary and available 
financing activities our financing activities provided an insignificant amount of cash in the year ended december  and used cash in the amount of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the use of cash for the years ended december  and represents primarily the repurchase of shares of our common stock in connection with the payment of withholding and payroll taxes due upon vesting of employee restricted stock awards 
future needs we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund cash used in our operations  restructurings and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our level of investment in technology and online marketing initiatives  our rate of growth in our local markets and in expanding our powered by zip broker referral network and possible litigation settlements and legal fees 
in addition  if the current macroeconomic environment and depressed state of the residential real estate market continues or worsens  we may have a greater need to fund our business by using our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  which could not continue indefinitely without raising additional capital 
we currently have no bank debt or line of credit facilities 
in the event that additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired  our business and results of operations will likely suffer

non gaap measure the table below shows the trend of adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands net revenue    adjusted ebitda    adjusted ebitda margin we present adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  as a supplemental measure of our performance 
we believe adjusted editda provides useful information regarding the operating results of our core business activity and prospects for the future 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss less interest income plus interest expense  provision for benefit from income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  stock based compensation and further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing core operating performance 
we present adjusted ebitda because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance 
in addition  we use adjusted ebitda to evaluate our financial results and business strategies  develop budgets  manage expenditures and as a factor in evaluating management s performance when determining incentive compensation 
our use of adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  non cash stock based compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long term incentive compensation package  although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges or credits resulting from matters we consider not to be reflective of our core ongoing operations  and other companies  including companies in our industry  may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
when evaluating our performance  adjusted ebitda should be considered alongside other financial measures  including net income and our other gaap results 
the following is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to the most comparable gaap measure  net loss  for the years ended december   and year ended december  reconciliation of non gaap adjusted ebitda to net income loss in thousands net loss    add back interest income provision for benefit from income taxes depreciation and amortization    stock based compensation expense    restructuring charges  net  legal settlements non core operating non gaap adjusted ebitda    item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements 
the principal objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income consistent with minimizing risk of material loss 
we believe this investment policy is prudent  and helps to reduce  but does not prevent  loss of principal  and results in minimal interest rate exposure on our investments 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds and our short term investments consisted primarily of highly liquid interest bearing securities 
the recorded carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to their short maturities and short term investments are carried at fair value 
the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument is limited 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  particularly since the majority of our investments are fixed income investments 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   there would be a negligible increase or decline in fair market value of the portfolio 
exchange rate sensitivity we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal  as we do not have any sales or expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
we have not engaged in any hedging or other derivative transactions to date
