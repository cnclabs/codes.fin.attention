we design  manufacture  test and service technologically sophisticated systems and products for customers through our jbt foodtech and jbt aerotech segments 
we have established a large installed base of food processing equipment as well as airport equipment and have built a strong global presence with manufacturing  sourcing  sales and service organizations located on six continents to support equipment that has been delivered to more than countries 
our strategy for growth is to grow our technology advantage  grow in emerging markets  grow beyond the sale and grow margins 
during  we made significant progress in some of these key areas and faced challenges in others 
revenue grew by  driven by strong performance in our jbt aerotech segment 
we advanced our technology advantage in key areas and continued to build our presence and capabilities in asia 
our aftermarket revenue grew by 
however  economic weakness in parts of europe  a major flood in bangkok  political unrest in north africa and the middle east  and softness in the north american poultry market all negatively impacted our jbt foodtech segment 
additionally  the currency exchange effects resulting from a strong swedish krona and brazilian real negatively impacted the margins in our freezer and fruit processing businesses 
in response to these challenges  we have taken decisive actions that will support our long term growth strategy 
we have shifted production of certain freezer product lines out of sweden to the us and china 
moving some high capacity freezer production to the us locates it closer to many of our major customers  reducing costs and increasing responsiveness 
establishing lower capacity freezer production in china expands our presence in a key emerging market 
the shift is part of a cost reduction plan we announced in january that supports our strategy to grow margins by lowering costs in jbt foodtech across the developed world 
the cost reduction plan consists primarily of a workforce reduction of approximately positions and is expected to be completed in the first half of we recognized a pre tax charge of million in connection with the plan in the fourth quarter of and expect to reduce costs by about million pre tax annually by we continue to be confident in our ability to generate cash flow  which is why on october   our board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to million of jbt common shares through december as we evaluate our operating results  we consider performance indicators like segment revenue and operating profit in addition to the level of inbound orders and order backlog

inbound orders and order backlog inbound orders represent the estimated sales value of confirmed customer orders received during the years ended december in millions jbt foodtech jbt aerotech other and intercompany eliminations total inbound orders order backlog is calculated as the estimated sales value of unfilled  confirmed customer orders as of december in millions jbt foodtech jbt aerotech total order backlog order backlog in our jbt foodtech segment at december  decreased by million since year end due to several large orders for tomato and fruit processing products received in that were delivered in additionally  we are experiencing longer order processing cycles in certain of our markets 
we expect to convert the entire jbt foodtech backlog at december  into revenue during order backlog in our jbt aerotech segment at december  decreased by million since year end primarily due to lower orders of gate equipment products 
backlog of orders for gate equipment products declined by million 
we expect to convert approximately of the jbt aerotech backlog at december  into revenue during liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities of our us and foreign operations and our credit facility 
we are not presently aware of any restrictions on the repatriation of our foreign funds  although these funds are considered permanently invested in our foreign subsidiaries 
if these funds were needed to fund our operations or satisfy obligations in the us  they could be repatriated and their repatriation into the us would cause us to incur additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
any additional taxes could be offset  in part or in whole  by foreign tax credits 
the amount of such taxes and application of tax credits would be dependent on the income tax laws and other circumstances at the time any of these amounts were repatriated 
we believe cash flows from operations and the credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital  research and development activities  capital expenditures  pension contributions and other financing requirements 
on october   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our common stock through december  we repurchased million of common stock in the timing  price and volume of future repurchases will be based on market conditions  relevant securities laws and other factors 
cash flows cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended on december  were as follows in millions cash provided by continuing operating activities cash required by continuing investing activities cash required provided by financing activities cash required by discontinued operations effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows provided by continuing operating activities in were million  representing a million increase compared to the change in the cash flows is primarily attributable to a much higher collection of receivables during than during additionally  during and we contributed million and million  respectively  to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the majority of our investing activities support the maintenance and upgrading of our installed base of leased equipment 
our annual capital spending typically ranges from million to million 
cash flows required by financing activities in were million compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of million in during  we reduced our debt by million compared to an increase in debt of million in tax withheld on restricted stock granted in the year of our spin off from fmc technologies  inc and vested in was million higher in compared to financing arrangements we have a million revolving credit facility that expires on july  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at libor or an alternative base rate  which is the greater of jpmorgan chase  na s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points  plus a margin dependent on our leverage ratio 
we are required to make periodic interest payments on the borrowed amounts and pay an annual facility fee ranging from to basis points  depending on our leverage ratio 
as of december   we had million drawn on the credit facility  million in letters of credit issued under the credit facility and million of additional available funds 
we have million of senior unsecured notes 
the senior unsecured notes are due on july  and require us to make semiannual interest payments 
our credit agreement and notes include restrictive covenants that  if not met  could lead to a renegotiation of our credit lines  requirement to repay our borrowings and or a significant increase in our cost of financing 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of our contractual obligations as shown in the following table debt instrument covenant measurement result as of december  revolving credit facility interest coverage ratio not less than leverage ratio not greater than capital expenditures not greater than million million restricted payments not greater than million million senior unsecured notes interest coverage ratio not less than leverage ratio not greater than interest coverage ratio is a comparison of the trailing twelve months consolidated ebitda  defined as net income plus interest expense plus income tax expense plus depreciation and amortization plus non cash expenses and extraordinary  unusual and non recurring items  to trailing twelve months interest expense 
leverage ratio is a comparison of the total indebtedness  defined as total debt plus guarantees of indebtedness of others plus obligations under financial letters of credit issued against the credit facility  to the trailing twelve month consolidated ebitda  as defined above 
capital expenditures are limited to million plus of the unutilized amount from prior year 
restricted payments include all payments to shareholders such as dividends and share repurchases 
we expect to remain in compliance with all restrictive covenants in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility in the global economic conditions will not impair our ability to meet our restrictive covenants  or the volatility in the capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 
as part of our strategy to grow where the world is growing fastest  we are expanding our operations in china and india 
due to greater restrictions on cash management in these regions  we have established credit facilities to fund some of the working capital requirements 
in july  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into two short term credit facilities that allow us to borrow up to million in china 
as of december   we had million borrowed under this credit facility 
in june  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a short term credit facility that allows us to borrow up to indian rupee rs million  or approximately million 
as of december   we had million borrowed under this credit facility 
defined benefit pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans that cover certain domestic and international employees 
our largest single pension plan is the us qualified plan 
at december   this plan accounted for of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation pbo and of the related plans assets 
due to a decrease in the discount rate used to value the pbo  the obligation increased by million while the assets experienced a loss of 
outlook we expect nominal growth across most product lines as market conditions in europe and north america remain uncertain  while emerging markets continue to grow 
however  we expect the strategic actions implemented in to drive margin expansion in on february   the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock  or approximately million 
the dividend will be paid on march  to stockholders of record at the close of business on march  we estimate that we will contribute million in to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans  primarily reflecting discretionary contributions to our us qualified pension plan 
we anticipate spending a total of to million on construction of a new jbt foodtech plant in lakeland  florida to replace our existing plant in the same area 
we expect it to be operational by the end of we continue to evaluate acquisitions in the normal course of business which we expect to fund with cash generated from operations or borrowings under our credit agreements 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period in millions total payments less than year years years after years long term debt a accrued interest operating leases unconditional purchase obligations b pension and other postretirement benefits c total contractual obligations a our available long term debt is dependent upon our compliance with covenants described in the previous section 
any violations of covenants or other events of default  which are not waived or cured  could have a material impact on our ability to maintain our committed financial arrangements 
b in the normal course of business  we enter into agreements with our suppliers to purchase raw materials or services 
these agreements include a requirement that our supplier provide products or services to our specifications and require us to make a firm purchase commitment to our supplier 
as substantially all of these commitments are associated with purchases made to fulfill our customers orders  the costs associated with these agreements will ultimately be reflected in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of income 
c this amount primarily reflects discretionary contributions to our us qualified pension plan 
required contributions for future years depend on factors that cannot be determined at this time 
the following is a summary of other off balance sheet arrangements at december  amount of commitment expiration per period in millions total amount less than year years years after years letters of credit and bank guarantees surety bonds total other off balance sheet arrangements to provide required security regarding our performance on certain contracts  we provide letters of credit  surety bonds and bank guarantees  for which we are contingently liable 
in order to obtain these financial instruments  we pay fees to various financial institutions in amounts competitively determined in the marketplace 
our ability to generate revenue from certain contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain these off balance sheet financial instruments 
our off balance sheet financial instruments may be renewed  revised or released based on changes in the underlying commitment 
historically  our commercial commitments have not been drawn upon to a material extent  consequently  management believes it is not likely that there will be claims against these commitments that would result in a negative impact on our key financial ratios or our ability to obtain financing 
critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
on an ongoing basis  our management re evaluates these estimates  judgments and assumptions for reasonableness because of the critical impact that these factors have on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed this disclosure 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements 
inventory valuation inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
in order to determine net realizable value  we evaluate each component of inventory on a regular basis to determine whether it is excess or obsolete 
we record the decline in the carrying value of estimated excess or obsolete inventory as a reduction of inventory and as an expense included in cost of sales in the period in which it is identified 
our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future demand for inventory 
in order to quantify excess or obsolete inventory  we begin by preparing a candidate listing of the components of inventory that have not demonstrated usage within the most recent two year period 
this list is then reviewed with sales  production and materials management personnel to determine whether this list of potential excess or obsolete inventory items is accurate 
management considers as part of this evaluation whether there has been a change in the market for finished goods  whether there will be future demand for on hand inventory items and whether there are components of inventory that incorporate obsolete technology 
then management assigns a reserve requirement  which is determined based on its assessment of cost recoverability  to the items on the candidate listing 
as a result  our estimate of excess or obsolete inventory is sensitive to changes in assumptions about future demand for the inventory 
since the determination of the reserve requirement is based on management judgment rather than a formulaic approach  we are unable to quantify with a high level of precision the effect that a change in demand assumptions would have on management s assessment of the excess and obsolete inventory reserve  although lower demand assumptions would generally result in an increase in excess and obsolete inventory 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to the identifiable net assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis  or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred  including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
in the fourth quarter of  we early adopted the amended guidance on goodwill impairment  which simplifies how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
it provides an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether further testing of goodwill is required 
if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount  then a quantitative test is required 
in performing the quantitative test  we determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach valuation method 
we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods  plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon  are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return 
the cash flows are derived from internal forecasts for the reporting unit 
forecasting future income requires us to use a significant amount of judgment 
in estimating future income  we use our internal operating budgets and long range planning projections 
we develop our budgets and long range projections based on recent results  trends  economic and industry forecasts influencing our performance  our backlog  planned timing of new product launches  and customer sales commitments 
we also apply judgment when selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  incorporating general economic and market conditions and selecting an appropriate control premium 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october  due to restructuring charges recorded in our food processing systems division fpsd  which includes the in container processing and fruit processing product lines  we chose to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for fpsd 
goodwill for the fpsd operating segment is tested at the reporting unit level  which is also the operating segment level 
the results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount 
a discount rate of was used 
increasing the discount rate to would not have affected our conclusion 
as a result of the assessment of the qualitative factors  we have determined it is not necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test on any of our other reporting units 
self insurance reserves we purchase third party insurance for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability claims that exceed a certain level 
we are responsible for the payment of claims under these insured limits as well as claims under our self insured healthcare plans 
the obligations associated with the incurred losses are determined using actuarial estimates 
these estimates are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions for medical costs  environmental hazards  and legal actions  as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change which could potentially be material to our results of operation and financial condition 
accounting for income taxes in determining our current income tax provision  we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
when we maintain deferred tax assets  we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered through adjustments to future taxable income 
to the extent we believe recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we record an allowance reducing the asset to a value we believe will be recoverable based on our expectation of future taxable income 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about our future income over the lives of the deferred tax assets  and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations 
forecasting future income requires us to use a significant amount of judgment 
in estimating future income  we use our internal operating budgets and long range planning projections 
we develop our budgets and long range projections based on recent results  trends  economic and industry forecasts influencing our segments performance  our backlog  planned timing of new product launches  and customer sales commitments 
significant changes in the expected realizability of the net deferred tax assets would require that we adjust the valuation allowance  resulting in a change to net income 
as of december   we estimated that it is not likely that we will realize income tax deductions for certain uncollectible receivables and  therefore  we have provided a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets 
we have estimated that it is likely that we will generate future taxable income in the us and most foreign jurisdictions  and have therefore not provided a valuation allowance against most of our deferred tax assets 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans pension and other postretirement plans costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates  investment returns  employee turnover rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
the actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results 
our pension and other postretirement benefits expense is typically sensitive to changes in our estimate of discount rate 
however  holding other assumptions constant  a change of percentage points in the discount rate would not significantly change the annual expense for our pension expense is sensitive to changes in our estimate of expected rate of return on plan assets 
the expected return on assets used in calculating the pension expense for the us pension plan  which represents percent of all pension plan assets  was for and for and for  the rate will be lowered to 
a change of percentage points in the expected return on assets assumption would impact pension expense by approximately million pre tax 
see note of the consolidated financial statements in item for additional discussion of our assumptions and the effects on the financial statements 
during  we amended the retirement benefits offered to our employees 
we discontinued future benefit accruals for active non union participants in our domestic defined benefit pension plans and froze future participation in our domestic defined benefit pension plans by non union employees as of december  concurrently  we also enhanced our defined contribution savings plans by adding a company non elective contribution with immediate vesting to all eligible non union employees in addition to the current company match of up to that vests over time 
recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
this standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the fasb subsequently deferred the effective date of certain provisions of this standard pertaining to the reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income  pending the issuance of further guidance on that matter 
because this amendment impacts presentation only  it will have no effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in order to manage and mitigate our exposure to these risks  we may use derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments where the objective is to generate profits solely from trading activities 
at december  and  our derivative holdings consisted of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency instruments embedded in purchase and sale contracts 
additionally  at december   we had an interest rate swap 
we do not hedge foreign currency translation risk 
these forward looking disclosures address potential impacts from market risks only as they affect our financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices or equity prices 
foreign currency exchange rate risk during  our foreign subsidiaries generated approximately of our revenue  driven by our operations in sweden which generated approximately of our revenue 
financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries for which the us dollar is not the functional currency are translated into us dollars 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk 
when we sell or purchase products or services  transactions are frequently denominated in currencies other than an operation s functional currency 
when foreign currency exposures exist  we may enter into foreign exchange forward instruments with third parties to economically hedge foreign currency exposures 
our hedging policy reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we do not apply hedge accounting for our foreign currency forward instruments 
we economically hedge our recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we expect any gains or losses in the hedging portfolio to be substantially offset by a corresponding gain or loss in the underlying exposures being hedged 
we also economically hedge firmly committed anticipated transactions in the normal course of business 
as these are not offset by an underlying balance sheet position being hedged  our earnings can be significantly impacted on a periodic basis by the change in unrealized value of these hedges 
we use a sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of an immediate adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rates 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar and all other variables are held constant 
we expect that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments will offset the changes in fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
a adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rates would reduce the value of our derivative instruments by approximately million pre tax as of december  this amount would be reflected in our net income but would be significantly offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk our debt instruments subject us to market risk associated with movements in interest rates 
we had million in variable rate debt outstanding at december  using sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of a adverse movement in the interest rate  or basis points  would not significantly impact the annual interest expense
