financial markets began on an upswing due to optimism that the global economy was finally recovering from the financial crisis 
however  the optimism was replaced by volatility as a number of shocks hit the global economy  negatively impacting equity markets around the world 
first  japan suffered a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami and nuclear emergency 
while markets outside of japan recovered from the initial shock  the nikkei index declined over for the year 
additionally  continental europe s sovereign debt issues worsened during  resulting in deepening concern about the financial condition of greece and other countries 
efforts by european authorities to address the crisis repeatedly fell short of market expectations and  as a result  equity markets in europe suffered declines in  with the ftse index down almost 
in the us  concern of default on the country s debt payments intensified in early august  followed immediately thereafter by the first ever downgrade of the us s credit rating by s p to aa from aaa 
us equity markets  as illustrated by the movement in the s p  were able to recover from double digit declines in the third quarter of to finish at levels consistent with the beginning of although global equity markets have staged a strong recovery after december  many still remain below their highs

invesco made progress in a number of areas that further enhanced our competitive position as the markets continued their 
table of contents measured return to pre financial crisis levels 
throughout  the company s financial performance strengthened 
in addition  invesco continued to deliver strong  long term investment performance  maintained its focus on its clients  and enhanced its profile in the industry 
as a global investment management firm dedicated to delivering investment excellence to our clients  invesco is committed to further strengthening and enhancing our best in class risk management approach 
a key factor in invesco s ability to weather the economic storms of the past three years was our integrated approach to risk management 
invesco s enterprise risk management erm approach is embedded in its management processes across the organization 
broadly  our approach includes two governance structures one for investments and another for business risk 
investment risk oversight is supported by the global performance measurement and risk group and the investment teams 
business risk oversight is supported by the corporate risk management committee and related committees 
our global performance measurement and risk group provides senior management and the board with insight into core investment risks  while our corporate risk management committee facilitates a focus on strategic  operational and other key business risks 
further  business component  functional  and geographic risk management committees maintain an ongoing risk assessment process that provides a bottom up perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business 
a key value of a robust enterprise risk management process is facilitating the flow of information and insight across the organization and applying that information to more effectively managing risk 
through this regular and consistent risk communication  the board has reasonable assurance that all material risks of the company are being addressed and that the company is propagating a risk aware culture in which effective risk management is sewn into the fabric of the business 
as a result of our efforts in this area  invesco is one of only four publicly rated asset managers designated with a strong enterprise risk management rating by s p 
in addition  we benefited from our long term efforts to ensure a diversified base of assets under management 
one of invesco s core strengths  and a key differentiator for the company within the industry  is our broad diversification across client domiciles  asset classes and distribution channels 
our geographical diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world 
this broad diversification enables invesco to withstand different market cycles and take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels 
the addition of morgan stanley s retail asset management business  including van kampen investments the acquired business or acquisition in and our anticipated successful integration of the business during enabled invesco to further strengthen our competitive position in the us the depth and breadth of our investment capabilities  our strong investment performance and a focused client engagement effort resulted in solid momentum in our us retail business throughout european infrastructure as part of the transformational initiative announced earlier this year  the company is in the process of outsourcing its transfer agency function in europe  which is presently operated internally 
this outsourcing activity is expected to be completed by december we believe that taking steps today to outsource our european transfer agency will allow the firm to better respond in the future to the pending but still uncertain regulatory environment 
it is too early to accurately forecast the implications of all the proposed regulations eg  mifid ii in europe and the retail distribution review in the uk  but it is clear that these have the potential to significantly change the relationships between distributors  clients and investment managers 
under any likely scenario  we believe outsourcing our european transfer agency will reduce both the cost and risk of operations for us and will allow us to react more swiftly to changes in the marketplace  and therefore further solidify and strengthen our competitive position 
during the year ended december   the company incurred million of costs directly related to the implementation of this initiative and will incur total implementation costs of up to million by the projected completion date of december the million estimate is based on the expected cost to outsource our european transfer agency and on our plans to make certain structural changes to our product and distribution platforms 
as regulations become more clear in the future  we will be able to provide updated estimates of the implementation costs and benefits of this initiative  to the extent that clarity of regulations affects the scope of the initiative 
the implementation costs associated with the european transformation will include primarily systems and data conversion  surplus leased space  staff severance related to a reduction in headcount of approximately employees  fund redomicile  legal  and consulting costs 
these costs will be included within the respective expense line items in the us gaap condensed consolidated income statement and will be excluded in arriving at non gaap earnings information 
this initiative is expected to generate material ongoing cost savings approximately million per year that will more than fully offset the implementation expense within a three year time frame after completion
