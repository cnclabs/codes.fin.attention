table of contents we currently have an unutilized million line of credit with the frost group 
on june   we repaid all amounts outstanding on the line of credit including million in principal and million in interest 
the line of credit  which previously expired on january   was renewed on february  on substantially the same terms as in effect at the time of expiration 
we are obligated to pay interest upon maturity  capitalized quarterly  on any outstanding borrowings under the line of credit at an annual rate  which is due march  the line of credit is collateralized by all of our us based personal property except our intellectual property 
we expect to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
we expect to incur substantial research and development expenses  including expenses related to the hiring of personnel and additional clinical trials 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will also increase as we expand our sales  marketing and administrative staff and add infrastructure 
we believe the cash and cash equivalents on hand at december  and the amounts available to be borrowed under our lines of credit are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations and debt service beyond the next months 
we based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong or are subject to change  and we may be required to use our available cash resources sooner than we currently expect 
if we acquire additional assets or companies  accelerate our product development programs or initiate additional clinical trials  we will need additional funds 
our future cash requirements will depend on a number of factors  including possible acquisitions  the continued progress of research and development of our product candidates  the timing and outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the status of competitive products  the availability of financing  and our success in developing markets for our product candidates 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs or possible acquisitions 
the following table provides information as of december  with respect to the amounts and timing of our known contractual obligation payments due by period 
contractual obligations in thousands after total open purchase orders operating leases credit lines total the preceding table does not include information where the amounts of the obligations are not currently determinable  including contractual obligations in connection with product license agreements and contingent consideration that includes payments upon achievement of certain milestones 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
equity based compensation 
we recognize equity based compensation as an expense in our financial statements and that cost is measured at the fair value of the awards and expensed over their vesting period 
equity based compensation arrangements to non employees are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date 
we estimate the grant date fair value of our stock option grants using a valuation model known as the black scholes merton formula or the black scholes model and allocate the resulting compensation expense over the corresponding requisite service period associated with each grant 
the black scholes model requires the use of several variables to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options including expected term  expected volatility  expected dividends and risk free interest rate 
we perform significant analyses to calculate and select the appropriate variable assumptions used in the black scholes model 
we also perform significant analyses to estimate forfeitures of equity based awards 
we are required to adjust our forfeiture estimates on at least an annual basis based on the number of share based awards that ultimately vest 
the selection of assumptions and estimated forfeiture rates is subject to significant judgment and future changes to our assumptions and estimates may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets 
the allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 
appraisals inherently require significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to  determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in process research and development projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows  and developing appropriate discount rates 
we believe the estimated fair values assigned to the curna  claros and finetech assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  the fair value estimates for the purchase price allocation may change during the allowable allocation period  which is up to one year from the acquisition date  if additional information becomes available that would require changes to our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue recognition 
generally  we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to our customers 
our estimates for sales returns are based upon the historical patterns of products returned matched against the sales from which they originated  and management s evaluation of specific factors that may increase the risk of product returns 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification method 
our reported net loss is directly affected by management s estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new standard on fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
the new standard changes fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements including measuring the fair value of financial instruments that are managed within a portfolio  the application of applying premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement  and additional disclosure about fair value measurements 
the new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect a material impact with the adoption of this new standard 
in june  the fasb issued a new standard on the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new standard eliminated the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
under the new standard  companies can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the new standard is effective at the beginning of fiscal years beginning after december  and we will comply with this requirement in the first quarter we do not expect a material impact with the adoption of this new standard 
in september  the fasb issued a new standard to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
the new standard allows companies an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining if it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under the new standard  a company is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the company determines  based on the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the new standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect a material impact with the adoption of this new standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk although we do not speculate in the foreign exchange market  we may from time to time manage exposures that arise in the normal course of business related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into offsetting positions through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts 
certain firmly committed transactions are hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts 
as exchange rates change  gains and losses on the exposed transactions are partially offset by gains and losses related to the hedging contracts 
both the exposed transactions and the hedging contracts are translated at current spot rates  with gains and losses included in earnings 

table of contents our derivative activities  which consist of foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps  are initiated to hedge forecasted cash flows that are exposed to foreign currency risk 
the foreign exchange forward contracts generally require us to exchange local currencies for foreign currencies based on pre established exchange rates at the contracts maturity dates 
as exchange rates change  gains and losses on these contracts are generated based on the change in the exchange rates that are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at maturity  and offset the impact of the change in exchange rates on the foreign currency cash flows that are hedged 
if the counterparties to the exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contracted currencies  we could be at risk for currency related fluctuations 
during  we entered into a foreign exchange  fixed interest rate swap contract that provides for us to pay a fixed interest rate on the underlying loan balance denominated in chilean pesos 
we entered into this agreement in chile for purchases of inventory denominated in us dollars 
a hypothetical interest rate change or foreign exchange rate change will not have a material impact on our results from operations or financial position 
we enter into these contracts with counterparties that we believe to be creditworthy and do not enter into any leveraged derivative transactions 
we had million in foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december  primarily to hedge chilean based operating cash flows against us dollars 
if chilean pesos were to strengthen in relation to the us dollar  our loss or gain on hedged foreign currency cash flows would be offset by the derivative contracts  with a net effect of zero 
we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments or purchasing hedging instruments or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose us to significant market risk  whether interest rate  foreign currency exchange  commodity price  or equity price risk 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk relates to our cash and investments and to our borrowings 
we maintain an investment portfolio of money market funds 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market interest rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio except for reduced income in a low interest rate environment 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
the weighted average interest rate related to our cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  was 
as of december   the principal value of our credit lines was million at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  bank obligations  repurchase agreements and high quality corporate issuers  and money market funds that invest in such debt instruments  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than three months
