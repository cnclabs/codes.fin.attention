item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading entitled liquidity and capital resources liquidity matters 
demand the recent recession has resulted in severe job losses  which could cause an increase in demand for our services  however  depending on the severity of the recession s impact on our payers particularly our state government payers  sufficient funds may not be allocated to compensate us for the services we provide at the current margins we enjoy or we may be required to provide more services to a growing population of beneficiaries without a corresponding increase in fees for these services 
prices certain markets have experienced and may continue to experience deflation  which would negatively impact our average fees and revenue 
our indebtedness may harm our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   our total consolidated long term debt was million 
on march   we refinanced our then existing debt under a new credit agreement 
under the repayment terms of the new credit agreement  we are obligated to repay the term loan in quarterly installments on the last day of each calendar quarter  which commenced on june   so that the following percentages of the outstanding principal amount will be paid as follows in year one  in year two  in year three  in year four and the remaining balance in year five 

table of contents our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to us and you  including it could adversely affect our ability to satisfy our obligations  an increased portion of our cash flows from operations may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations  working capital  capital expenditures  expansion  acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes  it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  it may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry  and it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business  our industry or the economy in general 
our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt 
if we were to fail to make any required payment under the agreements governing our indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in these agreements  we would be in default 
in the event we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants  it is uncertain whether the lenders will grant waivers for our non compliance 
our lenders would have the ability to require that we immediately pay all outstanding indebtedness 
if the lenders were to require immediate payment  we might not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under our credit facility or our convertible senior subordinated notes due in such event  we could be forced to seek protection under bankruptcy laws  which could have a material adverse effect on our existing contracts and our ability to procure new contracts as well as our ability to recruit and or retain employees 
accordingly  a default could have a significant adverse effect on the market value and marketability of our common stock 
changes in budgetary priorities of the government entities that fund the services we provide could result in our loss of contracts or a decrease in amounts payable to us under our contracts 
our revenue is largely derived from contracts that are directly or indirectly paid or funded by government agencies 
all of these contracts are subject to legislative appropriations and state budget approval 
consequently  a significant decline in government expenditures  shift of expenditures or funding away from programs that call for the types of services that we provide or change in government contracting or funding policies could cause payers to terminate their contracts with us or reduce their expenditures under those contracts  either of which could have a negative impact on our future operating results 
the availability for funding under our contracts with state governments is dependent in part upon federal funding to states 
changes in medicaid methodology may further reduce the availability of federal funds to states in which we provide services 
among the alternative medicaid funding approaches that states have explored are provider assessments as tools for leveraging increased medicaid federal matching funds 
provider assessment plans generate additional federal matching funds to the states for medicaid reimbursement purposes  and implementation of a provider assessment plan requires approval by the centers for medicare and medicaid services in order to qualify for federal matching funds 
these plans usually take the form of a bed tax or a quality assessment fee  which were required to be imposed uniformly across classes of providers within the state  except that such taxes only applied to medicaid health plans 
however  the deficit reduction act of  which was signed into law on february   or deficit reduction act  requires states that desire to impose provider taxes to impose taxes on all managed care organizations  not just medicaid managed care organizations 
this uniformity requirement as it relates to taxing all managed care organizations may make states more reluctant to use provider assessments as a vehicle for raising matching funds and  thus  reduce the amount of funding that the states receive and have available 
moreover  under the deficit reduction act  states may be allowed to reduce the benefits provided to certain medicaid enrollees  which could affect the services that states contract for with us 
we cannot make any assurances that these medicaid changes will not negatively affect the funding under our contracts 

table of contents president obama s proposed budget for fiscal year seeks to reduce spending for federal health care programs by approximately billion over the next decade 
as funding under our contracts is dependent in part upon federal funding  such funding changes  if adopted  could have a significant effect upon our business 
currently  many of the states in which we operate are facing budgetary shortfalls or changes in budgetary priorities 
in addition  in some states eligibility requirements for social services clients have been tightened to stabilize the number of eligible clients and in certain instances states have implemented or are considering implementing a single point of access to care or a managed care model  which reduces the size of our potential market in those states 
while many of these states are dealing with budgetary concerns by shifting costs from institutional care to home and community based care such as we provide  there is no assurance that this trend will continue 
we derive a significant amount of our revenues from a few payers  which puts us at risk 
we provide  or manage the provision of  government sponsored social services and non emergency transportation services to individuals and families who are eligible for government assistance pursuant to federal mandate with respect to government sponsored social services and members of the disability community  or senior citizens with respect to non emergency transportation services under various contracts with state and local governmental entities 
we generate a significant amount of our revenues from a few payers under a small number of contracts 
for example  in and we generated approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue from ten payers 
additionally  our top five payers related to our net services operating segment represent  in the aggregate  approximately  and  respectively  of our net services operating segment revenue for the years ended december   and the top five payers related to our social services operating segment represent  in the aggregate  approximately  and  respectively  of our social services operating segment revenue for the years ended december   and the loss of  reduction in amounts generated by  or changes in methods or regulations governing payments for our services under these contracts could materially reduce our revenue 
our contracts are not only short term in nature but can also be terminated prior to expiration  without cause and without penalty to the payers  and there can be no assurance that they will survive until the end of their stated terms or that upon their expiration these contracts will be renewed or extended 
most of our contracts contain base periods of only one year 
while some of them also contain options for renewal  usually successive six month or one year terms  payers are not required to extend their contracts into these option periods 
in addition  a significant number of our social services contracts not only allow the payer to terminate the contract immediately for cause such as for our failure to meet our contract obligations but also permit the payer to terminate the contract at any time prior to its stated expiration date 
in most cases the payer may terminate the social services contract without cause  at will and without penalty to the payer  either upon the expiration of a short notice period  typically days  and or immediately  in the event federal or state appropriations supporting the programs serviced by the contract are reduced or eliminated 
in the case of our non emergency transportation services contracts  these contracts are only cancellable for performance after notice and a cure period that typically ranges from days to days in length 
the failure of payers to renew or extend significant contracts or their early termination of significant contracts could adversely affect our financial performance 
we cannot anticipate if  when or to what extent a payer might terminate its contract with us prior to its expiration or fail to renew or extend its contract with us 
each of our contracts is subject to audit and modification by the payers with whom we contract  in their sole discretion 
our business depends on our ability to successfully perform under various government funded contracts 
the payers under these contracts can review our performance under these contracts  as well as our records  accounting and general business practices at any time and may  in their discretion suspend or prevent us from receiving new contracts or extending existing contracts because of violations or suspected violations of procurement laws or regulations  
table of contents terminate or modify our existing contracts  reduce the amount we are paid under our existing contracts  and or audit and object to our contract related fees 
as a government contractor  we are subject to an increased risk of litigation and other legal actions and liabilities 
as a government contractor  we are subject to an increased risk of investigation  criminal prosecution  civil fraud  whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities not often faced by companies that do not provide government sponsored services 
the occurrence of any of these actions  regardless of the outcome  could disrupt our operations and result in added expense and could limit our ability to obtain additional contracts in other jurisdictions 
a loss of our status as a licensed provider in any jurisdiction could result in the termination of a number of our contracts  which could negatively impact our revenues 
if we lost our status as a licensed provider in any jurisdiction  the contracts under which we provide services in that jurisdiction would be subject to termination 
moreover  such an event could constitute a violation of provisions of our contracts in other jurisdictions  resulting in further contract terminations 
if we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations  we could be liable for damages and financial penalties and harm our ability to keep our existing contracts or obtain new contracts 
our failure to comply with our contract obligations could  in addition to providing grounds for immediate termination of the contract for cause  negatively impact our financial performance and damage our reputation  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain new contracts 
our failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential damages 
the termination of a contract for cause could  for instance  subject us to liability for excess costs incurred by a payer in obtaining similar services from another source 
in addition  our contracts require us to indemnify payers for our failure to meet standards of care  and some of them contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties that we must pay if we breach these contracts 
moreover  negative results of audits by government auditors or their contractors may cause us to lose  not be considered for  or to otherwise not receive  business opportunities with government funded or other agencies or customers 
if we fail to estimate accurately the cost of performing certain contracts  we may incur losses on these contracts 
under our fee for service contracts  we receive fees based on our interactions with government sponsored clients 
to earn a profit on these contracts  we must accurately estimate costs incurred in providing services 
our risk on these contracts is that our client population is not large enough to cover our fixed costs  such as rent and other overhead 
our fee for service contracts are not reimbursed on a cost basis and therefore  if we fail to estimate our costs accurately  we may incur losses on these contracts 
additionally  approximately of our non emergency transportation services revenue is generated under capitated contracts with the remainder generated through fee for service and fixed cost contracts 
under our capitated contracts  we assume the responsibility of managing the needs of a specific geographic population by contracting out transportation services to local van  cab and ambulance companies on a per ride or per mile basis 
we use a pricing model to determine applicable contract rates  which take into account factors  such as estimated utilization  state specific data  previous experience in the state and or with similar services  estimated 
table of contents volume and availability of mass transit 
the amount of the fixed monthly per member per month fee is determined in the bidding process but predicated on actual historical transportation data for the subject geographic region provided by the payer  actuarial work performed in house as well as by third party actuarial firms and actuarial analyses provided by the payer 
if the utilization of our services is more than we estimated  the contract may not be profitable 
approximately and of our social services revenues or approximately and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  were derived from cost based service contracts for which we record revenue based on a combination of direct costs  indirect overhead allocations  and stated contractual margins on those costs  which puts us at risk that we may be required to subsequently refund a portion of the excess funds  if any 
our cost based service contracts require us to allow for contingencies such as budgeted costs not incurred  excess cost per service over the allowable contract rate and or an insufficient number of encounters 
for the years ended december  and  revenues from these contracts represented approximately and of our total revenues for the respective period 
in cases where funds paid to us exceed the allowable costs to provide services under the contracts  we may be required to pay back the excess funds 
our results of operations will continue to fluctuate due to seasonality 
our quarterly operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business 
in our social services operating segment  lower client demand for our home and community based services during the holiday and summer seasons generally results in lower revenue during those periods  however  our expenses related to the social services operating segment do not vary significantly with these changes 
as a result  our social services operating segment experiences lower operating margins during the holiday and summer seasons 
our net services operating segment also experiences fluctuations in demand for our non emergency transportation services during the summer  winter and holiday seasons 
due to higher demand in the summer months and lower demand in the winter and holiday seasons  coupled with a fixed revenue stream based on a per member per month based structure  our net services operating segment experiences lower operating margins in the summer season and higher operating margins in the winter and holiday seasons 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the seasonal demand for our home and community based services and non emergency transportation services 
as we enter new markets  we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with any competitive response by other social services and transportation providers 
while we obtain some of our business through responses to government requests for proposals  we may not be awarded contracts through this process in the future  and contracts we are awarded may not be profitable 
we obtain  and will continue to seek to obtain  a significant portion of our business from state or local government entities 
to obtain business from government entities  we are often required to respond to requests for proposals  or rfps 
to propose effectively  we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract  the time required to establish operations and the terms of the proposals submitted by competitors 
we must also assemble and submit a large volume of information within rigid and often short timetables 
our ability to respond successfully to rfps will greatly impact our business 
we may not be awarded contracts through the rfp process  and our proposals may not result in profitable contracts 

table of contents if we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with officials of government entities and agencies  we may not be able to successfully procure or retain government sponsored contracts  which could negatively impact our revenues 
to facilitate our ability to procure or retain government sponsored contracts  we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies 
these relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to the government entities and agencies prior to the development of an rfp or program for privatization of social services and enhance our chances of procuring contracts with these payers 
the effectiveness of our relationships may be reduced or eliminated with changes in the personnel holding various government offices or staff positions 
we also may lose key personnel who have these relationships 
we may be unable to successfully manage our relationships with government entities and agencies and with elected officials and appointees 
any failure to establish  maintain or manage relationships with government and agency personnel may hinder our ability to procure or retain government sponsored contracts 
the federal government may refuse to grant consents and or waivers necessary to permit for profit entities to perform certain elements of government programs 
under current law  in order to privatize certain functions of government programs  the federal government must grant a consent and or waiver to the petitioning state or local agency 
if the federal government does not grant a necessary consent or waiver or withdraw approval of any granted waiver  the state or local agency will be unable to contract with a for profit entity  such as us  to provide service 
failure by state or local agencies to obtain consents and or waivers could adversely affect our continued business and future growth 
our business could be adversely affected by future legislative changes that hinder or reverse the privatization of social services 
the market for our services depends largely on federal  state and local legislative programs 
these programs can be modified or amended at any time 
moreover  part of our growth strategy includes aggressively pursuing opportunities created by the federal  state and local initiatives to privatize the delivery of social services 
however  there are opponents to the privatization of social services and  as a result  future privatization of social services is uncertain 
if additional privatization initiatives are not proposed or enacted  or if previously enacted privatization initiatives are challenged  repealed or invalidated  our growth could be adversely impacted 
the federal government may not fund or fully implement or may repeal certain enacted healthcare reform legislation that could have a material adverse affect on the results of our operations 
we are focused on legislative trends at the federal level as the federal government has enacted healthcare reform legislation 
while we believe that the passage of healthcare reform legislation in the first quarter of could accelerate the demand for our services  there can be no assurances that programs under which we provide our services will receive continued or increased funding 
president obama s fiscal year budget seeks to decrease spending for federal health care programs by billion over the next decade 
such funding  if adopted  could have a significant effect upon our business 
recent judicial challenges to health care reform laws may delay or limit the implementation of health care reform and there can be no assurance of when  or if  the legislation will be fully implemented or when  and if  we will see any positive impact 
our strategic relationships with certain not for profit and tax exempt entities are subject to tax and other risks 
since some government agencies in certain of our markets prefer or require contracts for privatized social services to be administered through not for profit organizations  we rely on our long term relationships with not for profit organizations to provide services to these government agencies 
we currently maintain strategic relationships with not for profit social services organizations with which we have management contracts of varying lengths  of which are federally tax exempt organizations 

table of contents our strategic relationships with tax exempt not for profit organizations are similar to those in the hospital management industry where tax exempt or faith based not for profit hospitals are managed by for profit companies 
federal tax law requires that the boards of directors of not for profit tax exempt organizations be independent 
the boards of directors of the tax exempt not for profit organizations for which we provide management services have a majority of independent members 
the board members are predominately selected from independent members of the local community in which the not for profit entity operates 
decisions regarding our business relationships with these not for profit entities are made by their independent board members including approving the management fees we charge to manage their organizations and any discretionary bonuses 
federal tax law also requires that the management fees we charge the not for profit entities we manage be fixed and at fair market rates 
typically a fairness opinion is obtained by the not for profit entities we manage from an independent third party valuation consultant that substantiates the fair market rates 
if the internal revenue service determined that any tax exempt organization was paying more than market rates for services performed by us  the managed entity could lose its tax exempt status and owe back taxes and penalties 
generally  under state law  not for profit entities may pay no more than reasonable compensation for services rendered 
if the compensation paid to us by these not for profit entities is deemed unreasonable  then the state could take action against the not for profit entity which could adversely affect us 
government unions may oppose privatizing government programs to outside vendors such as us  which could limit our market opportunities 
our success depends in part on our ability to win contracts to administer and manage programs traditionally administered by government employees 
many government employees  however  belong to labor unions with considerable financial resources and lobbying networks 
these unions could apply political pressure on legislators and other officials seeking to privatize government programs 
union opposition could result in our losing government contracts or being precluded from providing services under government contracts or maintaining or renewing existing contracts 
inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage could damage our reputation and harm our ability to procure government sponsored contracts 
the media sometimes provides news coverage about our contracts and the services we provide to clients 
this media coverage  if negative  could influence government officials to slow the pace of privatizing government services 
moreover  inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage about us could harm our reputation and  accordingly  our ability to obtain government sponsored contracts 
we may incur costs before receiving related revenues  which could result in cash shortfalls 
when we are awarded a contract to provide services  we may incur expenses before we receive any contract payments 
these expenses include leasing office space  purchasing office equipment and hiring personnel 
as a result  in certain large contracts where the government does not fund program start up costs  we may be required to invest significant sums of money before receiving related contract payments 
in addition  payments due to us from payers may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures to approve government budgets in a timely manner 
moreover  especially under fee for service arrangements  any resulting cash shortfall could be exacerbated if we fail to either invoice the payer or to collect our fee in a timely manner 
our business is subject to risks of litigation 
we are in the human services and non emergency transportation services businesses which are subject to lawsuits and claims 
a substantial award could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flow 
table of contents and could adversely impact our ability to continue to purchase appropriate liability insurance 
we can be subject to claims for negligence or intentional misconduct in addition to professional liability type claims by an employee or a third party we engage to assist with the provision of services  including but not limited to  claims arising out of accidents involving vehicle collisions  and various claims that could result from employees or contracted third parties driving to or from interactions with clients and while providing direct client services 
we are also subject to claims alleging we did not properly treat an individual or failed to properly diagnose and or care for a client 
we can be subject to employee related claims such as wrongful discharge or discrimination or a violation of equal employment law and permitting issues 
while we are insured for these types of claims  damages exceeding our insurance limits or outside our insurance coverage  such as a claim for fraud  certain wage and hour violations or punitive damages  could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition 
furthermore  we can be subject to miscellaneous errors and omissions liability relative to the various management agreements we have with the not for profit entities we manage 
in the event of a claim and depending on  among other things  the circumstances  allegations  and size of the management contract  we could be subject to damages that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our use of a reinsurance program to cover certain claims for losses suffered and costs or expenses incurred could negatively impact our business 
we are reinsured with regard to a substantial portion of our general liability  professional liability and workers compensation insurance 
we also reinsure the general liability  professional liability  workers compensation insurance  and automobile liability of certain designated affiliated entities and independent third party transportation providers over various policy years under reinsurance programs through our two wholly owned captive insurance subsidiaries 
in the event that actual reinsured losses increase unexpectedly or exceed actuarially determined estimated reinsured losses under the program  the aggregate of such losses could materially increase our liability and adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  as the availability to us of certain traditional insurance coverage diminishes or increases in cost  we will continue to evaluate the levels and types of insurance we include in our self insurance program 
any increase to this program increases our risk exposure and therefore increases the risk of a possible material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
we could be subject to significant state regulation and potential sanctions if our health care benefits program is deemed to be a multiple employer welfare arrangement 
for the purpose of managing and providing employee healthcare benefits we deem ourselves to be a single employer under section of erisa with regard to our own employees as well as the employees of certain of our managed entities covered by our healthcare benefit program to whom we offered healthcare benefits through june the department of labor or individual states could disagree with our interpretation and consider our program to be a multiple employer welfare arrangement  or mewa  and  as such  subject to regulation by state insurance commissions 
if involuntarily deemed a mewa  our cost to manage the state by state regulatory environment for the self funded portion of our health insurance program would be prohibitive and we could  as a result  elect to maintain our self funded health insurance plan only for our owned entities  forcing the three managed entities currently included in our self funded plan to negotiate and purchase their own health benefits 
in addition  if our health care benefits program is determined to be a mewa  civil and or criminal sanctions are possible 
we face substantial competition in attracting and retaining experienced professionals  particularly social service professionals with respect to our social services and intellectual technology professionals with respect to our non emergency transportation services  and we may be unable to grow our business if we cannot attract and retain qualified employees 
our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced social services professionals who possess the skills and experience necessary to deliver high quality services to our clients 
our objective of providing the highest quality of service to our clients is strongly 
table of contents considered when we evaluate education  experience and qualifications of potential candidates for employment as direct care and administrative staff 
to that end  we attempt to hire professionals who have attained a bachelor s degree  master s degree or higher level of education and certification or licensure as direct care social services providers and administrators 
these employees are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
we must quickly hire project leaders and case management personnel after a contract is awarded to us 
contract provisions and client needs determine the number  education and experience levels of social services professionals we hire 
we continually evaluate client census  case loads and client eligibility to determine our staffing needs under each contract 
our performance in our non emergency transportation services business largely depends on the talents and efforts of our highly skilled intellectual technology professionals 
competition for skilled intellectual technology professionals can be intense 
our success depends on our ability to recruit  retain and motivate these individuals 
our ability to attract and retain employees with the requisite experience and skills depends on several factors including  but not limited to  our ability to offer competitive wages  benefits and professional growth opportunities 
some of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater financial  technical  political and marketing resources  name recognition and a larger number of clients and payers than we do 
the inability to attract and retain experienced personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations 
since  our business has grown significantly in size and complexity 
this growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on our management  systems  internal controls and financial and physical resources 
in addition  we expect that we will need to further develop our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems to accommodate future growth 
this could require us to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel  retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information technology infrastructure 
the nature of our business is such that qualified management personnel can be difficult to find 
our inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
any acquisition that we undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and harm our operating results 
we anticipate that we will continue making strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
we have made a number of acquisitions since our inception 
the success of these and other acquisitions depends in part on our ability to integrate acquired companies into our business operations 
there can be no assurance that the companies acquired will continue to generate income at the same historical levels on which we based our acquisition decisions  that we will be able to maintain or renew the acquired companies contracts  that we will be able to realize operating and economic efficiencies upon integration of acquired companies  or that the acquisitions will not adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we continually review opportunities to acquire other businesses that would complement our current services  expand our markets or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in connection with our acquisition strategy  we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders percentage ownership and or we could incur or assume substantial debt or assume contingent liabilities 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to  the following problems assimilating the purchased operations  unanticipated costs and legal or financial liabilities associated with an acquisition  diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  
table of contents entering markets in which we have limited or no experience  potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations  the incurrence of excessive leverage in financing an acquisition  failure to maintain and renew contracts  unanticipated operating  accounting or management difficulties in connection with an acquisition  and dilution to our earnings per share 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisition and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business 
changes in the accounting method for business combinations may have an adverse impact on our reported or future financial results 
for the years ended december  and prior  we capitalized substantially all acquisition related costs such as attorney s fees and accountant s fees  as well as contingent consideration to the seller as part of the purchase price 
beginning with the year ended december   with respect to business acquisitions we complete  we are required to expense acquisition related costs as incurred  record contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date with subsequent changes in fair value to be recognized in the income statement  and recognize any adjustments to the purchase price allocation as a period cost in our income statement under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our success depends on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace 
in our social services business  we compete for clients and for contracts with a variety of organizations that offer similar services 
most of our competition consists of local social services organizations that compete with us for local contracts such as united way supported agencies and faith based agencies such as catholic social services  jewish family and children s services and the salvation army 
other competitors include local not for profit organizations and community based organizations 
historically  these types of organizations have been favored in our industry as incumbent providers of services to government entities 
we also compete with larger companies  such as res care  inc  which provides support services  training and educational programs predominantly to medicaid eligible beneficiaries 
national mentor  inc is the country s largest provider of foster care services and competes with us in existing markets for foster care services 
in addition  many institutional providers offer some type of community based care including such organizations as cornell companies  inc and the devereaux foundation 
some of these companies have greater financial  technical  political  marketing  name recognition and other resources and a larger number of clients and or payers than we do 
in addition  some of these companies offer more services than we do 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  competition from new entrants into the markets in which we operate our social services business 
increased competition may result in pricing pressures  loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of clients or payers  any of which could harm our business 
we compete with a variety of organizations that provide similar non emergency transportation services to medicaid eligible beneficiaries in local markets such as american medical response  coordinated transportation solutions  inc  first transit  inc  medical transportation management inc  mv transportation  inc  and southeast trans 
our competitors largely compete for smaller scale contract opportunities that encompass smaller geographic areas 
for example  most of our competitors seek to win contracts for specific counties  whereas we seek to win contracts for the entire state 
if these competitors begin to compete on a larger scale basis  it could result in pricing pressures  loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of clients or payers  any of which could harm our business 

table of contents our business is subject to state licensing regulations and other regulatory provisions  including regulatory provisions governing surveys  audits  anti kickbacks  self referrals  false claims and the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  and changes to or violations of these regulations could negatively impact our revenues 
in many of the locations where we operate  we are required by state law to obtain and maintain licenses 
the applicable state and local licensing requirements govern the services we provide  the credentials of staff  record keeping  treatment planning  client monitoring and supervision of staff 
the failure to maintain these licenses or the loss of a license could have a material adverse impact on our business and could prevent us from providing services to clients in a given jurisdiction 
most of our contracts are subject to surveys or audit by our payers 
we are also subject to regulations that restrict our ability to contract directly with a government agency in certain situations 
such restrictions could affect our ability to contract with certain payers 
in addition  we are or may be subject to anti kickback  self referral and false claim laws 
violations of these laws may result in significant penalties  including repayment of any amounts alleged to be overpayments or in violation of such laws  criminal fines  civil money penalties  damages  imprisonment  a ban from participation in federally funded healthcare programs and or bans from obtaining government contracts 
such fines and other penalties could negatively impact our business by decreasing profits due to repayment of overpayments or from the imposition of fines and damages  damaging our reputation and diverting our management resources 
due to our access  use or disclosure of health information relating to individuals  we are subject to the privacy mandates of hipaa 
hipaa mandates  among other things  the adoption of standards to enhance the efficiency and simplify the administration of the nation s healthcare system 
hipaa requires the united states department of health and human services  or dhhs  to adopt standards for electronic transactions and code sets for basic healthcare transactions such as payment  eligibility and remittance advices  or transaction standards  privacy of individually identifiable health information  or privacy standards  security of individually identifiable health information  or security and standards  electronic signatures  as well as unique identifiers for providers  employers  health plans and individuals and enforcement 
final regulations have been issued by dhhs for the privacy standards  transaction standards and security standards 
compliance with the privacy standards became mandatory in april  compliance with the transaction standards became mandatory in october although full implementation was delayed with respect to the medicare program until october  and compliance with the security standards became mandatory in april in february  dhhs published its final rule on enforcement of the hipaa administrative simplification provisions  including the transaction standards  the security standards and the privacy rule 
this enforcement rule addresses  among other issues  dhhs s policies for determining violations and calculating civil money penalties  how dhhs will address the statutory limitations on the imposition of civil monetary penalties  and various procedural issues 
on february   the hitech act was enacted as part of arra to  among other things  extend certain of hipaa s obligations to business associates  impose new notice of privacy breach reporting obligations  extend enforcement powers to state attorney generals and amend the hipaa privacy and security laws to strengthen the civil and criminal enforcement of hipaa  establishing four categories of violations that reflect increasing levels of culpability  four corresponding tiers of penalty amounts that significantly increase the minimum penalty amount for each violation  and a maximum penalty amount of million for all violations of an identical provision 
as a healthcare provider  we are required to comply in our operations with these standards as applicable and are subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to do so  including the increased penalties under hitech 
in addition  in connection with providing services to customers that also are healthcare providers  we could be considered business associates and as such are required to provide satisfactory written assurances to those customers that we will provide those services in accordance with the privacy standards and security standards 
moreover  as business associates  hitech now imposes certain direct compliance obligations upon us 
hipaa has required and will require significant and costly changes for our company and others in the healthcare industry 

table of contents we have appointed an internal committee to maintain our privacy and security policies regarding client information in compliance with hipaa 
this committee is responsible for training our employees  including our regional and local managers and staff  to comply with hipaa and monitoring compliance with the policy 
the costs associated with our ongoing compliance could be substantial  which could negatively impact our profitability 
our business is subject to security breaches and attacks 
we provide human services and therefore our information technology systems store customer information protected by numerous federal and state regulations 
since our systems include interfaces to third party stakeholders  often connected via the internet  we are subject to cybersecurity risks 
the nature of our business  where services are often performed outside a secured location  adds additional risk 
while we have implemented measures to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber attacks  our measures may not be effective 
any security breach or loss of data could adversely affect our business and  as a result  we could incur liability  regulatory actions  fines or litigation 
our international operations expose us to various risks  any number of which could harm our business 
we operate in canada through our wholly owned subsidiary  wcg international consultants ltd  and as a result  we are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business across national boundaries  any one of which could adversely impact our business 
in addition to currency fluctuations  these risks include  among other things economic downturns  changes in or interpretations of local law  governmental policy or regulation  restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of the country  varying tax systems  delays from doing business with governmental agencies  nationalization of foreign assets  and government protectionism 
we intend to continue to evaluate opportunities to establish new operations in canada 
one or more of the foregoing factors could impair our current or future operations and  as a result  harm our overall business 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions and we are taxable in most of them and face the risk of double taxation if one jurisdiction does not acquiesce to the tax claims of another jurisdiction 
we currently operate in the united states and canada and are subject to income taxes in those countries and the specific states and or provinces where we operate 
in the event one taxing jurisdiction disagrees with another taxing jurisdiction  we could experience temporary or permanent double taxation and increased professional fees to resolve taxation matters

several acquisitions were completed in the fiscal years ended december   and  which affected the comparability of the information reflected in the selected financial data 
see the year to year analysis included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report for more information 
in february  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program whereby we may repurchase shares of our common stock from the open market from time to time 
as of december   we spent approximately million to purchase  shares of our common stock in the open market under this program 
the shares of our common stock repurchased were placed into treasury 
no shares of our common stock were repurchased under this program during   and as a result of our acquisition activity during  we incurred approximately million of debt obligations by issuing million of the subordinated notes and drawing down million under our credit and guaranty agreement with cit healthcare llc 
due to the significant and sustained decline in our market capitalization and the uncertainty in the state payer environment as well as the impact of related budgetary decisions on our earnings  we initiated asset impairment tests and  based on the results  we recorded asset impairment charges totaling approximately million related to our goodwill and other intangible assets for the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we prepaid million and million  respectively  of our term loan debt under the credit and guaranty agreement  as amended 
our current and long term debt obligations decreased to approximately million at december  from million at december  and from million at december  non emergency transportation services revenue for  and was positively impacted by the effect of membership increases related to new and existing contracts and negotiated rate increases throughout a number of contracts due to increased utilization  program enhancements and future projected program costs

additionally  in  these items were partially offset by total tax benefits of 
table of contents million recognized during the three months ended september  related to the true up of our tax provision from the filing of our united states federal and state tax returns 
the million true up was primarily attributable to reconciling our estimated liabilities using a blended state tax rate to actual state tax return amounts

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item  entitled  selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
certain risks  uncertainties and other factors  including but not limited to those set forth in item a  entitled  risk factors and elsewhere in this report may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
overview of our business we provide government sponsored social services directly and through not for profit social services organizations whose operations we manage  and we arrange for and manage non emergency transportation services 
as a result of and in response to the large and growing population of eligible beneficiaries of government sponsored social services and non emergency transportation services  increasing pressure on governments to control costs and increasing acceptance of privatized social services  we have grown both organically and by consummating strategic acquisitions 
we believe our business model enables us to be nimble in the face of uncertain market conditions 
we are focused on legislative trends both at the federal and state levels as the federal government has enacted healthcare reform legislation 
we believe that the passage of healthcare reform legislation in the first quarter of could accelerate the demand for our services 
while we believe we are well positioned to benefit from healthcare reform legislation and to offer our services to a growing population of individuals eligible to receive our services  there can be no assurances that programs under which we provide our services will receive continued or increased funding 
additionally  there can be no assurance of when the legislation will be implemented or when  and if  we will see any positive impact 
we completed our social services contract renewal cycle with substantially all contracts renewed and with relatively stable rates 
with respect to our non emergency transportation management services segment  or net services  we were awarded six of the nine incumbent contracts in arkansas  connecticut  delaware  pennsylvania  south carolina and virginia one of our largest contracts 
two of the nine incumbent contracts in georgia and nevada have yet to be finalized as they are subject to or under protest by competitors in these states 
moreover  we lost one incumbent contract in colorado 
in addition  we added new contracts in michigan  missouri  new york  wisconsin and texas 
additionally  our new contract awards  and some of our renewed contracts  have come at lower margins relative to historical amounts 
while we believe we are positioned to potentially benefit from recent trends that favor our in home provision of social services  budgetary pressures still exist that could reduce funding for the services we provide 
for example  president obama s proposed budget for fiscal year seeks to reduce spending for federal health care programs by approximately billion over the next decade 
as funding under our contracts is dependent in part upon federal funding  such funding changes  if adopted  could have a significant effect upon our business 
we believe our business model allows us to make adjustments to help mitigate state budget pressures that are impacted by federal spending and system reforms that could challenge our overall profit margins 
as of december   we provided social services directly to approximately  clients  and had approximately million individuals eligible to receive services under our non emergency transportation services contracts 
we provided services to these clients from almost locations in states  the district of columbia and british columbia 
our working capital requirements are primarily funded by cash from operations and borrowings from our credit facility  which provides funding for general corporate purposes and acquisitions 
we remain focused on 
table of contents reducing our debt and in march we replaced our then existing credit facility with a new credit agreement and repurchased approximately million in principal amount of the convertible senior subordinated notes due  or the notes  during ytd as discussed in further detail below under the heading entitled liquidity and capital resources obligations and commitments 
how we grow our business and evaluate our performance our business has grown internally through organic expansion into new markets  increases in the number of clients served under contracts we or the entities we manage are awarded  and externally through acquisitions 
we typically pursue organic expansion into markets that are contiguous to our existing markets or where we believe we can quickly establish a significant presence 
when we expand organically into a market  we typically have no clients or perform no management services in the market and are required to incur start up costs including the costs of space  required permits and initial personnel 
these costs are expensed as incurred and our new offices can be expected to incur losses for a period of time until we adequately grow our revenue from clients or management fees 
we continue to selectively identify and pursue strategic acquisitions in markets where we see opportunities but where we lack the contacts and or personnel to make a successful organic entry 
unlike organic expansion which involves start up costs that may dilute earnings  expansion through acquisitions have generally been accretive to our earnings 
however  we bear financing risk and where debt is used  the risk of leverage by expanding through acquisitions 
we also must integrate the acquired business into our operations which could disrupt our business and we may not be able to realize operating and economic synergies upon integration 
finally  our acquisitions may involve purchase prices in excess of the fair value of tangible assets and cash or receivables 
this excess purchase price is allocated to intangible assets  including goodwill  and is subject to periodic evaluation and impairment or other write downs that are charges against our earnings 
there are no assurances  however  that we will complete acquisitions in the future or that any completed acquisitions will prove profitable for us 
in all our markets we focus on several key performance indicators in managing our business 
specifically  we focus on growth in the number of clients served  as that particular metric is the key driver of our revenue growth 
we also focus on the number of employees and the amount of outsourced transportation cost as these items are our most important variable costs and the key to the management of our operating margins 
acquisition on june   we acquired all the equity interest of the redco group  inc  or redco 
redco is a pennsylvania corporation that provides home and community based services 
the purchase price of  was funded by our cash flow from operations 
additionally  we repaid redco s debt of approximately million in connection with the acquisition 
historically  we have provided various management services to redco for a fee under a management services agreement 
this acquisition further expands our home and community based services in pennsylvania 
how we earn our revenue we operate in two segments social services and non emergency transportation services  or net services 
social services our revenue is derived from our provider contracts with state and local government agencies and government intermediaries  hmos  commercial insurers  and from our management contracts with not for profit social services organizations 
the government entities that pay for our services include welfare  child welfare and 
table of contents justice departments  public schools and state medicaid programs 
under a majority of the contracts where we provide social services directly  we are paid an hourly fee 
in other such situations  we receive a set monthly amount or we are paid amounts equal to the costs we incur to provide agreed upon services 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of operations as either revenue from home and community based services or foster care services 
where we contract to manage the operations of not for profit social services organizations  we receive a management fee that is either based upon a percentage of the revenue of the managed entity or a predetermined fee 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of operations as management fees 
because we provide substantially all administrative functions for these entities and our management fees are largely dependent upon their revenues  we also monitor for management and disclosure purposes the revenues of the entities we manage 
we refer to the revenues of these entities as managed entity revenue 
net services where we provide non emergency transportation management services  we contract with state medicaid and local agencies  regional and medical hospital systems or private managed care companies 
most of our contracts for non emergency transportation management services are capitated where we are paid on a per member per month basis for each eligible member 
we do not direct bill for services under our capitated contracts as our revenue is based on covered lives 
our school transportation contracts are with local governments and are paid on a per trip basis or per bus per day basis 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of operations as non emergency transportation services revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates general in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets  accrued transportation costs  accounting for management agreement relationships  loss reserves for certain reinsurance and self funded insurance programs  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with our board of directors  audit committee and disclosure committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time services are rendered at predetermined amounts stated in our contracts and when the collection of these amounts is considered to be reasonably assured 
at times we may receive funding for certain services in advance of services actually being rendered 
these amounts are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue until the actual services are rendered 
as services are rendered  documentation is prepared describing each service  time spent  and billing code under each contract to determine and support the value of each service provided 
this documentation is used as a basis for billing under our contracts 
the billing process and documentation submitted under our contracts vary among our 
table of contents payers 
the timing  amount and collection of our revenues under these contracts are dependent upon our ability to comply with the various billing requirements specified by each payer 
failure to comply with these requirements could delay the collection of amounts due to us under a contract or result in adjustments to amounts billed 
the performance of our contracts is subject to the condition that sufficient funds are appropriated  authorized and allocated by each state  city or other local government 
if sufficient appropriations  authorizations and allocations are not provided by the respective state  city or other local government  we are at risk of immediate termination or renegotiation of the financial terms of our contracts 
social services segment fee for service contracts 
revenue related to services provided under fee for service contracts is recognized at the time services are rendered and collection is determined to be probable 
such services are provided at established billing rates 
fee for service contracts represented approximately and of our social services operating segment revenue for and  respectively 
cost based service contracts 
revenue from our cost based service contracts is recorded based on a combination of direct costs  indirect overhead allocations  and stated contractual margins on those costs 
these revenues are compared to annual contract budget limits and  depending on reporting requirements  allowances may be recorded for certain contingencies such as projected costs not incurred or excess cost per service over the allowable contract rate 
this policy results in recognizing revenue from these contracts based on allowable costs incurred 
the annual contract amount is based on projected costs to provide services under the contracts with adjustments for changes in the total contract amount 
we annually submit projected costs for the coming year which assist the contracting payers in establishing the annual contract amount to be paid for services provided under the contracts 
after the contracting payers year end  we submit cost reports which are used by the contracting payers to determine the amount  if any  by which funds paid to us for services provided under the contracts were greater than the allowable costs to provide these services 
completion of this review process may take several years from the date we submit the cost report 
in cases where funds paid to us exceed the allowable costs to provide services under contract  we may be required to pay back the excess funds 
our cost reports are routinely audited by our payers on an annual basis 
we periodically review our provisional billing rates and allocation of costs and provide for estimated adjustments from the contracting payers 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made in our consolidated financial statements for any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any cost report audits 
differences between the amounts provided and the settlement amounts  which historically have not been material  are recorded in our consolidated statement of operations in the year of settlement 
cost based service contracts represented approximately and of our social services operating segment revenue for and  respectively 
annual block purchase contract 
our annual block purchase contract with the community partnership of southern arizona  referred to as cpsa  requires us to provide or arrange for behavioral health services to eligible populations of beneficiaries as defined in the contract 
we must provide a complete range of behavioral health clinical  case management  therapeutic and administrative services 
we are obliged to provide services only to those clients with a demonstrated medical necessity 
our annual funding allocation amount is subject to increase when our encounters exceed the contract amount  however  such increases in the annual funding allocation amount are subject to government appropriation and may not be approved 
there is no contractual limit to the number of eligible beneficiaries that may be assigned to us  or a specified limit to the level of services that may be provided to these beneficiaries if the services are deemed to be medically necessary 
therefore  we are at risk if the costs of providing necessary services exceed the associated reimbursement 
we are required to regularly submit service encounters to cpsa electronically 
on an on going basis and at the end of cpsa s june fiscal year  cpsa is obligated to monitor the level of service encounters 
if the encounter data is not sufficient to support the year to date payments made to us  unless waived  cpsa has the right to prospectively reduce or suspend payments to us 

table of contents for revenue recognition purposes  our service encounter value which represents the value of actual services rendered must equal or exceed of the revenue recognized under our annual block purchase contract for the contract year 
the remaining of revenue recognized in each reporting period represents payment for network overhead administrative costs incurred in order to fulfill our obligations under the contract 
administrative costs include  but are not limited to  intake services  clinical liaison oversight for each behavioral health recipient  cultural liaisons  financial assessments and screening  data processing and information systems  staff training  quality and utilization management functions  coordination of care and subcontract administration 
we recognize revenue from our annual block purchase contract which correlates to the service encounter value 
if our service encounter value is less than of the amounts received from cpsa for the contract year  unless waived  we recognize revenue equal to the service encounter value and record a liability for any excess amounts received 
cpsa has not reduced  withheld  or suspended any material payments that have not been subsequently reimbursed 
we believe our encounter data is sufficient to have earned all amounts recorded as revenue under this contract 
if our service encounter value equals of the amounts received from cpsa for the contract year  we recognize revenue at the contract amount  which is one twelfth of the established annual contract amount each month 
if our service encounter value exceeds of the contract amount  we recognize revenue in excess of the annual funding allocation amount if collection is reasonably assured 
we evaluate factors regarding payment probability related to the determination of whether any such additional revenue over the contractual amount is considered to be reasonably assured 
the terms of the contract may be reviewed prospectively and amended as necessary to ensure adequate funding of our contractual obligations  however  we cannot guarantee amendments will be completed or that funding will be adequate 
our revenues under the annual block purchase contract for and represented approximately and  respectively  of our social services operating segment revenues for each year 
management agreements 
we maintain management agreements with a number of not for profit social services organizations whereby we provide certain management services for these organizations 
in exchange for our services  we receive a management fee that is either based on a percentage of the revenues of these organizations or a predetermined fee 
management fees earned under our management agreements represented approximately and of our social services operating segment revenue for and  respectively 
the costs associated with generating our management fee revenue are accounted for in client service expense and in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
net services segment capitation contracts 
approximately of our non emergency transportation services revenue is generated under capitated contracts where we assume the responsibility of meeting the transportation needs of a specific geographic population 
revenues under capitation contracts with our payers result from per member monthly fees based on the number of participants in our payer s program 
aggregate revenue from our top five payers for and represented approximately of our net services operating segment revenue for such period 
fee for service contracts 
revenues earned under fee for service contracts are recognized when the service is provided 
revenue under these types of contracts is based upon contractually established billing rates less allowance for contractual adjustments 
estimates of contractual adjustments are based upon payment terms specified in the related agreements 

table of contents accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts clients are referred to us through governmental social services programs and we only provide services at the direction of a payer under a contractual arrangement 
these circumstances have historically minimized any uncollectible amounts for services rendered 
however  we recognize that not all amounts recorded as accounts receivable will ultimately be collected 
we record all accounts receivable amounts at their contracted amount  less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk that an account will not be collected 
we regularly evaluate our accounts receivable  especially receivables that are past due  and reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific client collection issues 
we pay particular attention to amounts outstanding for days and longer 
any account receivable older than days is deemed uncollectible and written off or fully reserved unless we have specific information from the payer that payment for those amounts is forthcoming or other evidence which we believe supports the collection of amounts older than days 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific payer s inability to meet its financial obligation  we record a specific addition to our allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
under certain of our contracts  billings do not coincide with revenue recognized on the contract due to payer administrative issues 
these unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue recorded for which no amount has been invoiced and for which we expect an invoice will not be provided to the payer within the normal billing cycle 
all unbilled amounts are expected to be billed within one year 
our write off experience for and was less than of revenue 
accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets when we consummate an acquisition we separately value all acquired identifiable intangible assets apart from goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc  topic business combinations 
we analyze the carrying value of goodwill at the end of each fiscal year 
in connection with our year end asset impairment test  we reconcile the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization including a reasonable control premium 
as part of this annual impairment test  we also compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  there is an indication of impairment 
if an indication of impairment is identified  the impairment loss  if any  is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
in calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other identifiable assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
similarly conducted interim impairment tests may also be required in advance of our annual impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value  including goodwill  of one or more of our reporting units below the reporting unit s carrying value 
such circumstances could include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the climate of our business  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in determining whether or not we had goodwill impairment to report for the years ended december   and  we considered both a market based valuation approach and an income based valuation approach when estimating the fair values of our reporting units with goodwill balances as of such dates 
in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units  greater weight was attributed to the market approach than the income approach as we place less confidence on the forecasted results after we weighted the market based 
table of contents valuation results at and the income based valuation results at for the majority of our reporting units  which was consistent with our weighting methodology in and under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using one or more methods based on current values in the market for similar businesses 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the cash flow streams expected to be generated by the reporting unit over an appropriate period and then discounting the cash flows to present value using an appropriate discount rate 
the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions  including estimates of future revenue and expenses  growth rates and discount rates 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows  including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises  market conditions change or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding whether existing goodwill is impaired could change and result in a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
based on the results of our asset impairment test completed as of december   and  we determined that none of our goodwill was impaired 
the assumptions used to estimate fair value were based on estimates of future revenue and expenses incorporated in our current operating plans  growth rates and discounts rates  our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations 
significant assumptions and estimates included in our current operating plans were associated with revenue growth  profitability  and related cash flows 
the discount rate used to estimate fair value was risk adjusted in consideration of the economic conditions of the reporting units 
we also considered assumptions that market participants may use 
by their nature  these projections and assumptions are uncertain 
potential events and circumstances that could have an adverse effect on our assumptions include the lack of sufficient funds allocated by our state and local government payers to compensate us for the level of services we currently provide or the potential increased level of service we may be required to provide in the future due to the impact of the current economic downturn  and loss of a significant contract 
the fair values of our other reporting units were in excess of their carrying values 
in connection with our acquisitions  we allocate a portion of the purchase consideration to management contracts  customer relationships  restrictive covenants  software licenses and developed technology based on the direct or indirect contribution to future cash flows on a discounted cash flow basis expected from these intangible assets over their respective useful lives 
we assess whether any relevant factors limit the period over which acquired assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows for amortization purposes and determine an appropriate useful life for acquired customer relationships based on the expected period of time we will provide services to the payer 
while we use discounted cash flows to value intangible assets  we have elected to use the straight line method of amortization to determine amortization expense 
if applicable  we assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our long lived assets based on undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the review indicates that the carrying value is not fully recoverable  the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of any long lived asset is recognized as an impairment loss 
accrued transportation costs transportation costs are estimated and accrued in the month the services are rendered by outsourced providers utilizing gross reservations for transportation services less cancellations  and average costs per transportation service by customer contract 
average costs per contract are derived by utilizing historical cost trends 
actual costs relating to a specific accounting period are monitored and compared to estimated accruals 
adjustments to those accruals are made based on reconciliations with actual costs incurred 
accounting for management agreement relationships due to the nature of our business and the requirement or desire by certain payers to contract with not for profit social services organizations  we sometimes enter into management contracts with not for profit 
table of contents social services organizations where we provide them with administrative  program and other management services 
these not for profit organizations contract directly with state and local agencies to provide a variety of community based mental health and foster care services to children and adults 
each of these organizations is separately incorporated and  with respect to the internal revenue code section c entities  organized with its own independent board of directors 
our management agreements with these not for profit organizations typically require us to provide management  accounting  advisory  supportive  consultative and administrative services  require us to provide the necessary resources to effectively manage the business and services provided  require that we hire  supervise and terminate personnel  review existing personnel policies and assist in adopting and implementing progressive personnel policies  and compensate us with a management fee in exchange for the services provided 
all of our management services are subject to the approval or direction of the managed entities board of directors 
we have concluded that our management agreements do not meet the provisions of asc topic  consolidation  or asc  thus the operations of these organizations are not consolidated with our operations 
we will evaluate the impact of the provisions of asc  if any  on future acquired management agreements 
loss reserves for certain reinsurance and self funded insurance programs we reinsure a substantial portion of our general and professional liability and workers compensation costs under reinsurance programs through our wholly owned subsidiary social services providers captive insurance company  or spcic 
spcic is a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of arizona 
spcic maintains reserves for obligations related to our reinsurance programs for our general and professional liability and workers compensation coverage 
as of december  and  spcic had reserves of approximately million and million  respectively  for the general and professional liability and workers compensation programs 
in addition  we own provado insurance services  inc  or provado  a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of south carolina 
provado has historically provided reinsurance for policies written by a third party insurer for general liability  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage coverage to various members of the network of subcontracted transportation providers and independent third parties within our net services operating segment 
effective february   provado has not renewed its reinsurance agreement and will not assume additional liabilities for policies commencing thereafter 
it continues to administer existing policies for the foreseeable future and resolves remaining and future claims related to these policies 
provado maintains reserves for obligations related to the reinsurance programs for general liability  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage coverage 
as of december  and  provado had reserves of approximately million and million  respectively 
these reserves are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as reinsurance liability reserves 
we utilize analyses prepared by third party administrators and independent actuaries based on historical claims information with respect to the general and professional liability coverage  workers compensation coverage  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage to determine the amount of required reserves 
we also maintain a self funded health insurance program provided to our employees 
with respect to this program  we consider historical and projected medical utilization data when estimating our health insurance 
table of contents program liability and related expense as well as using services of a third party administrator 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  in reserve for our self funded health insurance programs 
we continually analyze our reserves for incurred but not reported claims  and for reported but not paid claims related to our reinsurance and self funded insurance programs 
we believe our reserves are adequate 
however  significant judgment is involved in assessing these reserves such as assessing historical paid claims  average lags between the claims incurred date  reported dates and paid dates  and the frequency and severity of claims 
we are at risk for differences between actual settlement amounts and recorded reserves and any resulting adjustments are included in expense once a probable amount is known 
there were no significant adjustments recorded in the periods covered by this report 
any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these programs above our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic compensation stock compensation  or asc  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payments at fair value 
with respect to stock option awards  the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing formula and amortized over the option s vesting periods 
the black scholes merton option pricing formula requires us to make assumptions for the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility  life of options and risk free interest rate 
we adopted the requirements of asc using the modified prospective transition method in which compensation costs are recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of asc for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of asc that remain unvested on the effective date 
we follow the short cut method prescribed by asc to calculate our pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of asc  or apic pool 
there was no effect on our financial results for or related to the application of the short cut method to determine our apic pool balance 
under asc  the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the estimated tax benefit of compensation costs recognized in the statement of operations for those options are classified as financing cash flows 
for  the amount of net excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise and cancellation of stock options was approximately  net of approximately  in tax shortfalls resulting from the cancellation of stock options 
for and  we had a net tax shortfall resulting from the exercise and cancellation of stock options of approximately  and  net of approximately  and  in excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options  respectively 
the gross excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options are reflected as cash flows from financing activities for  and in our consolidated statements of cash flows

income taxes deferred income taxes are determined by the liability method in accordance with asc topic income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are

results of operations segment reporting 
our financial operating results are organized and reviewed by our chief operating decision maker along our service lines in two reportable segments ie  social services and net services 
we operate these reportable segments as separate divisions and differentiate the segments based on the nature of the services they offer 
the following describes each of our segments 
social services social services includes government sponsored social services consisting of home and community based counseling  foster care and not for profit management services 
our operating entities within social services provide services to a common customer group  principally individuals and families 
all of our operating entities within social services follow similar operating procedures and methods in managing their operations and each operating entity works within a similar regulatory environment  primarily under medicaid regulations 
we manage our operating activities within social services by actual to budget comparisons within each operating entity rather than by comparison between entities 
the actual operating contribution margins of the operating entities that comprise social services ranged from approximately to for the year ended december  we believe that the long term operating contribution margins of our operating entities that comprise social services will approximate between and as the respective entities markets mature  we cross sell our services within markets  and standardize our operating model among entities including acquisitions 
our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial and non financial information for each individual entity within social services 
while financial performance in comparison to budget is evaluated on an entity by entity basis  our operating entities comprising social services are aggregated into one reporting segment for financial reporting purposes because we believe that the operating entities exhibit similar long term financial performance 
in addition  our revenues  costs and contribution margins are not significantly affected by allocating more or less resources to individual operating entities within social services because the economic characteristics of our business are substantially dependent upon individualized market demographics which affect the amount and type of services in demand as well as our cost structure primarily payroll and related costs and contract rates with payers 
in conjunction with the financial performance trends  we believe the similar qualitative characteristics of the operating entities we aggregate within social services and budgetary constraints of our payers in each market provide a foundation to conclude that the entities that we aggregate within social services have similar economic characteristics 
thus  we believe the economic characteristics of our operating entities within social services meet the criteria for aggregation into a single reporting segment under asc topic segment reporting 
net services net services includes managing the delivery of non emergency transportation services 
we operate net services as a separate division with operational management and service offerings distinct from our social services operating segment 
financial and operating performance reporting is conducted at a contract level and reviewed weekly at both the operating entity level as well as the corporate level by our chief operating decision maker 
gross margin performance of individual contracts is consolidated under the associated operating entity and direct general and administrative expenses are allocated to the operating entity

partially offsetting increases in these revenues for as compared to  was the impact of a transition to managed care in certain of our markets where tighter controls over authorizations and referrals are being implemented in response to continuing state budget challenges 
we believe the trend away from the more expensive out of home providers in favor of home and community based delivery systems like ours will continue 
in addition  we believe that our effective low cost home and community based service delivery system is becoming more attractive to certain payers that have historically only contracted with not for profit social services organizations 
net services completed winning of competitive bids  and was successful in retaining eight of nine incumbent contracts  only losing in colorado  an approximately million annual revenue contract 
in south carolina  net services was awarded new regions after the removal of a competitor and also won all five new competitive bids 
our net services revenue for as compared to was favorably impacted by new contracts in michigan effective january  and wisconsin effective july   as well as the expansion of current business in our new jersey and arkansas markets  and the expansion of our california ambulance commercial and managed care lines of business 
we also incurred additional operating and implementation costs related to 
table of contents these market expansions  including staffing  training  travel and outreach communication material costs related to our new contracts 
furthermore  while our net services revenue was favorably impacted by new contracts and expansion into new and existing markets  we incurred additional net services expenses  primarily in new jersey  due to higher utilization incurred in the additional counties relative to the already established per member per month reimbursement  additional trip volume throughout several other markets  competitive pricing of our new contracts and per member per month reimbursement rate decreases in existing and renewed contracts 
this resulted in lower net services operating income for as compared to effective july   our rates in new jersey were adjusted to account for a portion of the higher expense incurred to serve the expansion population 
this rate increase combined with our ongoing negotiations with our transportation network in new jersey resulted in a slightly improved operating margin with respect to this contract for the second half of as compared to the first half of we expect continued revenue growth and we are working to maintain our overall operating margins 
additionally  on march   we refinanced our credit facility with a new senior secured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of million 
interest accrues on the outstanding principal amount of the loans at a rate per annum of libor plus an applicable margin  which ranges from to and is payable at least once every three months based on our consolidated leverage ratio

this increase in revenue was partially offset by the impact of state budget constraints in nevada  decreases in cost reimbursements in michigan that were attributable to contract start up costs during the first half of  reduction of contract amounts in arizona  decreased census in our tutoring programs  the transition to managed care in certain regions and contract terminations in texas 
foster care services 
our foster care services revenue declined from to primarily as a result of decreased service provided in certain markets due to an emphasis on payer cost containment 
our efforts in the tennessee market to increase census have reduced the revenue impact of state system changes whereby clients are being referred into lower levels of foster care services and earlier discharges are occurring with referrals to alternative home and community based services  as appropriate 
management fees

a significant portion of this revenue was generated under capitated contracts where we assumed the responsibility of meeting the transportation needs of beneficiaries residing in a specific geographic region

seasonality our quarterly operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business 
in our social services operating segment  lower client demand for our home and community based services during the holiday and summer seasons generally results in lower revenue during those periods  however  our expenses related to the social services operating segment do not vary significantly with these changes 
as a result  our social services operating segment experiences lower operating margins during the holiday and summer seasons 
our net services operating segment also experiences fluctuations in demand for our non emergency transportation services during the summer  winter and holiday seasons 
due to higher demand in the summer months and lower demand in the winter and holiday seasons  coupled with a fixed revenue stream based on a per member per month based structure  our net services operating segment experiences lower operating margins in the summer season and higher operating margins in the winter and holiday seasons 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the seasonal demand for our home and community based services and non emergency transportation services 
as we enter new markets  we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with any competitive response by other social services and transportation providers

contingent obligations 
on august   our board of directors adopted the providence service corporation deferred compensation plan  or the deferred compensation plan  for our eligible employees and independent contractors or a participating employer as defined in the deferred compensation plan 
under the deferred compensation plan participants may defer all or a portion of their base salary  service bonus  performance based compensation earned in a period of months or more  commissions and  in the case of independent contractors  compensation reportable on form the deferred compensation plan is unfunded and benefits are paid from our general assets 
as of december   there were seven participants in the deferred compensation plan 
we also maintain a a deferred compensation rabbi trust plan for highly compensated employees of our net services operating segment 
benefits are paid from our general assets under this plan 
as of december   highly compensated employees participated in this plan 
we may be obligated to pay an amount up to  to the sellers under an earn out provision pursuant to a formula specified in an asset purchase agreement effective july  by which we acquired certain assets of an entity located in california 
the earn out payment as such term is defined in the asset purchase agreement  if earned  will be paid in cash 
the earn out period ends on december  if the contingency is resolved in accordance with the related provisions of the asset purchase agreement and the additional consideration becomes distributable  we will record the fair value of the consideration issued as an additional cost to acquire the associated assets  which will be charged to earnings 
management agreements we maintain management agreements with a number of not for profit social services organizations that require us to provide management and administrative services for each organization 
in exchange for these services  we receive a management fee that is either based upon a percentage of the revenues of these organizations or a predetermined fee 
the not for profit social services organizations managed by us that qualify under section c of the internal revenue code  referred to as a c entity  each maintain a board of directors  a majority of which are independent 
all economic decisions by the board of any c entity that 
table of contents affect us are made solely by the independent board members 
we encourage each managed entity to obtain a third party fairness opinion from an independent appraiser retained by the independent board members of the tax exempt organizations 
management fees generated under our management agreements represented and of our revenue for and  respectively 
in accordance with our management agreements with these not for profit organizations  we have obligations to manage their business and services 
management fee receivable at december  and december  totaled million and million  respectively  and management fee revenue was recognized on all of these receivables 
in order to enhance liquidity of the entities we manage  we may allow the managed entities to defer payment of their respective management fees 
in addition  since government contractors who provide social or similar services to government beneficiaries sometimes experience collection delays due to either lack of proper documentation of claims  government budgetary processes or similar reasons outside the contractors control either directly or as managers of other contracting entities  we generally do not consider a management fee receivable to be uncollectible due solely to its age until it is days old 
the following is a summary of the aging of our management fee receivable balances as of december  and march  june  september and december  at less than days days days days over days december  march  june  september  december  each month we evaluate the solvency  outlook and ability to pay outstanding management fees of the entities we manage 
if the likelihood that we will not be paid is other than remote  we defer the recognition of these management fees until we are certain that payment is probable 
we have deemed payment of all of the management fee receivables to be probable based on our collection history with these entities as the long term manager of their operations 
our days sales outstanding for our managed entities decreased from days at december  to days at december   which was partly attributable to our purchase of redco who fully paid their management fees prior to our acquisition of the entity in june reinsurance and self funded insurance programs reinsurance we reinsure a substantial portion of our general and professional liability and workers compensation costs under reinsurance programs through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  social services providers captive insurance company  or spcic 
we also provide reinsurance for policies written by a third party insurer for general liability  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage coverage to certain members of the network of subcontracted transportation providers and independent third parties under our net services operating segment through provado 
provado  a wholly owned subsidiary of logisticare  is a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of south carolina 
the decision to reinsure our risks and provide a self funded health insurance program to our employees was made based on current conditions in the insurance marketplace that have led to increasingly higher levels of self insurance retentions  increasing number of coverage limitations  and fluctuating insurance premium rates 

table of contents spcic spcic  which is a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of arizona  reinsures third party insurers for general and professional liability exposures for the first dollar of each and every loss up to million per loss and million in the aggregate 
the cumulative reserve for expected losses since inception in of this reinsurance program at december  was approximately million 
the excess premium over our expected losses may be used to fund spcic s operating expenses  fund any deficit arising in workers compensation liability coverage  provide for surplus reserves  and to fund any other risk management activities 
spcic reinsures a third party insurer for worker s compensation insurance for the first dollar of each and every loss up to  per occurrence with a million annual policy aggregate limit 
the cumulative reserve for expected losses since inception in of this reinsurance program at december  was approximately million 
based on an independent actuarial report  our expected losses related to workers compensation and general and professional liability in excess of our liability under our associated reinsurance programs at december  was approximately million 
we recorded a corresponding receivable from third party insurers and liability at december  for these expected losses  which would be paid by third party insurers to the extent losses are incurred 
we have an umbrella liability insurance policy providing additional coverage in the amount of million in the aggregate in excess of the policy limits of the general and professional liability insurance policy and automobile liability insurance policy 
spcic had restricted cash of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively  which was restricted to secure the reinsured claims losses of spcic under the general and professional liability and workers compensation reinsurance programs 
the full extent of claims may not be fully determined for years 
therefore  the estimates of potential obligations are based on recommendations of an independent actuary using historical data  industry data  and our claims experience 
although we believe that the amounts accrued for losses incurred but not reported under the terms of our reinsurance programs are sufficient  any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with these claims made under these programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
provado under a reinsurance agreement with a third party insurer  provado reinsures the third party insurer for the first  of each loss for each line of coverage  subject to an annual aggregate equal to of gross written premium  and certain claims in excess of  to an additional aggregate limit of million 
the cumulative reserve for expected losses of this reinsurance program at december  was approximately million 
effective february   provado has not renewed its reinsurance agreement and will not assume liabilities for policies commencing after that date 
it continues to administer existing policies for the foreseeable future and resolves remaining and future claims related to these policies 
the liabilities for expected losses and loss adjustment expenses are based primarily on individual case estimates for losses reported by claimants 
an estimate is provided for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred but not reported on the basis of our claims experience and claims experience of the industry 
these estimates are reviewed at least annually by independent consulting actuaries 
as experience develops and new information becomes known  the estimates are adjusted

health insurance we offer our employees an option to participate in a self funded health insurance program 
as of december   health claims were self funded with a stop loss umbrella policy with a third party insurer to limit the maximum potential liability for individual claims to  per person and for a maximum potential claim liability based on member enrollment 
the aggregate maximum potential claim liability is approximately million for our social services and net services operating segments health insurance claims are paid as they are submitted to the plan administrator 
we maintain accruals for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the plan administrator and therefore have not been paid 
the incurred but not reported reserve is based on an established cap and current payment trends of health insurance claims 
the liability for the self funded health plan of approximately million and million as of december  and december   respectively  was recorded in reinsurance liability reserve in our consolidated balance sheets 
we charge our employees a portion of the costs of our self funded group health insurance programs 
we determine this charge at the beginning of each plan year based upon historical and projected medical utilization data 
any difference between our projections and our actual experience is borne by us 
we estimate potential obligations for liabilities under this program to reserve what we believe to be a sufficient amount to cover liabilities based on our past experience 
any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under this program above what we reserve could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

we did not purchase shares of our common stock during and under this plan 
during the term of the old credit agreement we were prohibited from purchasing shares of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
no such prohibition exists under the new credit agreement described above 
liquidity matters we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash availability under the credit agreement provide funds necessary to meet our operating plan for the expected operating plan for this period provides for full operation of our businesses as well as interest and projected principal payments on our debt 
we may access capital markets to raise equity financing for various business reasons  including required debt payments and acquisitions 
the timing  term  size  and pricing of any such financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing 
in addition  with respect to required debt payments  the credit agreement requires us subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the credit agreement to prepay the outstanding loans in an aggregate amount equal to of the net cash proceeds received from certain asset dispositions  debt issuances  insurance and casualty awards and other extraordinary receipts

for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples  which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount
