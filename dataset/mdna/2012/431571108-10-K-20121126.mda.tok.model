item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview in millions throughout management s discussion and analysis the following discussion compares our results for the fiscal year ended september   to the fiscal year ended september  we begin the discussion at a consolidated level and then provide separate detail about the process equipment group  batesville  and corporate 
these financial results are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap 
we also provide certain non gaap operating performance measures 
these non gaap measures are referred to as adjusted and exclude the tax benefit of the international integration  expenses associated with long term incentive compensation related to the international integration  backlog amortization  antitrust litigation  business acquisitions  inventory step up  restructuring  and sales tax recoveries  as well as the related income tax 
this non gaap information is provided as a supplement  not as a substitute for  or as superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
we analyze net revenue on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods 
we provide this information because exchange rates can distort the underlying change in sales  either positively or negatively 
we use this non gaap information internally to make operating decisions and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful period to period comparisons of our ongoing operating results 
the information can also be used to perform trend analysis and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items 
we believe this information provides a higher degree of transparency

table of contents see note for more detailed information 
the income tax rate was compared to 
the variance was largely due to a tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of due to our determination that certain international earnings that were previously expected to be repatriated are now permanently reinvested 
our adjusted income tax rate was compared to in the prior year 
the rate was favorably impacted by an increase in the percentage of foreign source income in lower rate jurisdictions  and a decrease in uncertain tax positions 
year ended september   compared to year ended september  consolidated revenue grew or on a constant currency basis 
the process equipment group s revenue increased or on a constant currency basis 
the revenue increase was due primarily to the acquisition of k tron in april months of results included in fiscal year versus six months included in and rotex in august one month of results included in fiscal year

table of contents results of operations the process equipment group fiscal year ended september  a b amount of revenue amount of revenue amount of revenue revenue gross profit operating expenses operating profit depreciation and amortization a fiscal year includes one month of operations related to the rotex acquisition on august  b fiscal year includes six months of operations related to the k tron acquisition on april  fiscal year ended september   compared to fiscal year ended september  revenue increased  or on a constant currency basis 
the increase was attributable primarily to the rotex acquisition  as well as growth in the existing process equipment group s revenue 
revenue growth was also positively impacted by the sale of equipment related to the production of proppants used in hydraulic fracturing fracking 
hydraulic fracturing enables the production of natural gas and oil from rock formations  eg shale rock  far below the earth s surface 
future revenue could be impacted by market  legislative  environmental  and regulatory changes surrounding the use of hydraulic fracturing in the us and abroad 
future revenue for the process equipment group is influenced by order backlog because of the lead time involved in fulfilling engineered to order equipment for customers 
though backlog can be an indicator of future revenue  it might not include many projects and parts orders that are booked and shipped within the same quarter 
the timing of order placement  size  extent of customization  and customer delivery dates can create fluctuations in backlog and revenue 
revenue attributable to backlog is also affected by foreign exchange fluctuations for orders denominated in currencies other than united states us dollars 
based upon new orders accepted  less orders completed and shipped  backlog increased from on september  to on september  gross profit increased to due to increased volume  primarily reflecting the impact from the rotex acquisition 
gross profit margin declined by basis points to 
gross profit margin for the process equipment group is influenced by a variety of factors  including the timing and size of orders  the mix of products and services sold  and market factors that impact pricing 
adjusted gross profit margin declined by basis points to due to product mix and market factors that impact pricing 
adjusted gross profit margin excludes restructuring costs in and inventory step up charges in 
step ups in inventory value were recorded at the time of the rotex acquisition and were subsequently expensed when the inventory was sold 
the process equipment group s adjusted gross profit margin may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  however  we expect adjusted gross profit margin to fluctuate within a normal historical range on an annual basis 
we continue to see progress in the implementation of hillenbrand lean business principles in our process equipment group 
earlier this year we strategically realigned the process equipment group through the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities 
this resulted in the closure of one manufacturing plant  enabling the process equipment group to more efficiently meet customer needs  while continuing to provide the same high quality products and services 
operating expenses increased to due to months of operations from the rotex acquisition in fiscal year compared to one month of operations from the rotex acquisition in fiscal year acquisitions also impacted amortization expense with of expense in fiscal year compared to in the prior year 
on an operating expense to sales ratio basis  this represents an improvement of basis points to 
this improvement was driven by the integration of rotex  which has a lower operating expense to sales ratio than the other process equipment group operating companies 
on an adjusted basis  our operating expense ratio improved basis points to 
adjusted operating expenses exclude restructuring charges in related to the consolidation of manufacturing facilities and backlog amortization in and in 

table of contents fiscal year ended september   compared to fiscal year ended september  revenue increased  or on a constant currency basis 
fiscal year included months of operations related to the k tron acquisition and one month of operations related to the rotex acquisition 
fiscal year included only six months of operations related to the k tron acquisition 
based upon an increased level of new orders accepted  including those related to the rotex acquisition  minus orders completed and shipped during the period  the process equipment group s backlog increased from on september   to on september  gross profit increased to  primarily due to increased volume  including the impact from the k tron and rotex acquisitions

batesville fiscal year ended september  amount of revenue amount of revenue amount of revenue revenue gross profit operating expenses operating profit depreciation and amortization fiscal year ended september   compared to fiscal year ended september  revenue decreased  or on a constant currency basis primarily due to a decline in burial volume 
the burial volume decline was caused by an estimated reduction in north american burials  driven in part by an estimated decline in north american deaths 
north america experienced one of the largest drops in year over year deaths in the past years 
burial volume was also negatively impacted by the rate at which consumers opted for cremation 
average sales prices were relatively flat year over year 
gross profit decreased to primarily due to lower volume  increased distribution and commodity costs  restructuring charges  and short term transition costs 
gross profit margin declined basis points to 
adjusted gross profit margin declined basis points to and excludes of restructuring charges 
batesville s management consistently sizes operations to respond to changing market conditions and consumer preferences  and continuously evaluates capacities to ensure products are manufactured in the most efficient manner possible 
batesville consolidated the first and second shifts at one of its plants and converted one of its international manufacturing facilities into a distribution center 
we expect these changes to deliver approximately of annual savings going forward  however  we did incur certain short term transition costs that must be considered in determining the net long term savings 
in the current year  batesville experienced approximately in short term transition costs that negatively impacted gross profit 
operating expenses decreased to management continues to adjust the cost structure to offset declining volumes and reduced compensation and benefit expenses this year by this included of savings related to changes in employee benefits and other estimates that we do not expect to take place again in the future 
our operating expense to sales ratio increased from to 
on an adjusted basis  our operating expense to sales ratio improved by basis points to 
adjusted operating expenses exclude the following items antitrust litigation expense of in fiscal year and in fiscal year restructuring charges related to termination benefits of in fiscal year and in fiscal year 
table of contents long term incentive compensation of related to the current year international integration sales tax recoveries of in fiscal year fiscal year ended september   compared to fiscal year ended september  revenue decreased  or on a constant currency basis 
burial unit volume decreased and was the primary contributor to the reduction  although improved volume on non burial products helped limit the impact 
we believe the volume decrease was attributable to increased cremation rates 
offsetting this impact was a modest increase in average selling price that contributed to revenue 
gross profit decreased to primarily due to increased commodity costs  in particular  fuel and steel 
gross profit margin decreased basis points to 
operating expenses decreased to our operating expense to sales ratio improved by basis points to

these expenses on a percentage of consolidated revenue basis were  an improvement of basis points compared to in the prior year 
we expect this expense base to continue to decline as a percentage of sales 
the year over year decline was driven by decreased long term incentive compensation and decreased short term incentive compensation in our corporate operations 
during fiscal year  we incurred of business acquisition costs related to our planned acquisition of coperion  see note  and acquisition of rotex  all incurred by our corporate operations 
during fiscal year  we incurred of business acquisition costs related to our acquisitions of rotex and k tron  of which was incurred by our corporate operations 
the vesting of our long term performance based stock awards is contingent upon the creation of shareholder value as measured by the cumulative cash returns and final period net operating profit after tax compared to the established hurdle rate over a three year period 
as such  the tax benefit from the international integration resulted in of additional expense related to performance based stock awards in  of which was incurred by our corporate operations 
during fiscal year  we incurred of restructuring charges related to our joint ownership interests in corporate aircraft distributed to us when we separated from hill rom and termination benefits related to the cessation of airport operations 
these restructuring charges resulted from our collective plans with hill rom to sell or dispose of our jointly owned aircraft and to cease 
table of contents operations at the airport owned by hill rom 
the charges are primarily related to asset impairments for the aircraft and termination benefits 
this restructuring will reduce future costs related to these aviation assets and the operation of the airport 
fiscal year ended september   compared to fiscal year ended september  operating expenses excluding business acquisition and restructuring costs increased 
long term incentive compensation increased in our corporate operations and in total for the company  due to having a total of three years of long term incentive compensation grants outstanding in fiscal year versus two years in fiscal year our annual grants began in fiscal year and vest over three years  therefore  fiscal year had two outstanding grants incurring expense and fiscal year had three outstanding grants incurring expense 
employee compensation and benefits increased and legal expenses increased in fiscal year during fiscal year  we incurred of business acquisition costs related to our acquisitions of rotex and k tron  of which was incurred by our corporate operations 
during fiscal year  we incurred of business acquisition costs related to our acquisition of k tron  of which was incurred by our corporate operations 
during fiscal year  we incurred of restructuring charges related to our joint ownership interests in corporate aircraft distributed to us when we separated from hill rom 
these restructuring charges resulted from our collective plans with hill rom to sell or dispose of two of our jointly owned aircraft and modifications to our aviation access and use agreements 
the charges are primarily related to asset impairments for the two aircraft

given that strategy  it is a natural consequence to incur related expenses  such as amortization from acquired intangible assets and additional interest expense from debt funded acquisitions 
accordingly  we use earnings before interest  income tax  depreciation  and amortization ebitda  among other measures  to monitor our business performance 

table of contents fiscal year ended september  net income interest income interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization ebitda antitrust litigation long term incentive compensation related to the international integration restructuring inventory step up business acquisition costs sales tax recoveries ebitda adjusted consolidated adjusted ebitda for the fiscal year ended september   decreased primarily due to the decline in burial volume at batesville and lower investment income 
this decline was offset in part by growth due to the rotex acquisition  as well as growth in the existing process equipment group operating companies 
for the fiscal year ended september   consolidated adjusted ebitda increased over the prior year primarily due to the k tron and rotex acquisitions and higher investment income  offset in part by lower profits in the batesville business platform 
liquidity and capital resources we believe the ability to generate cash is critical to the value of the company 
in this section  we tell you about our ability to generate and access cash to meet our business needs 
we will describe actual results in generating and utilizing cash by comparing the last three years 
we will also talk about any significant trends to help you understand how this could impact us going forward 
we will tell you about how we see operating  investing  and financing cash flows being impacted for the next months 
while it is not a certainty  we will tell you where we think cash will come from and how we intend to use it 
we will also talk about significant risks or possible changes that could impact those expectations 
finally  we will tell you about other significant matters that could affect our liquidity on an ongoing basis 
fiscal year ended september  in millions cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operating activities was less in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily because of the following in fiscal year  there was no activity related to the forethought note 
in fiscal year  we received a payment of interest in conjunction with the final settlement of the forethought note  offset by of interest income 
the process equipment group s core pre tax operating cash flows contributed approximately more to our consolidated operating cash flows in fiscal year compared to the prior year  as months of operations were included for rotex compared to one month in fiscal year cash payments for income taxes decreased in fiscal year 
table of contents cash provided by operating activities was higher in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily because of the following in fiscal year  we received a payment of interest in conjunction with the final settlement of the forethought note in offset by of interest income 
in fiscal year  we received a contractual payment offset by of interest income 
the process equipment group s core pre tax operating cash flows contributed approximately more to our consolidated operating cash flows in fiscal year compared to the prior year  as months of operations were included in fiscal year compared to six months in the prior year 
cash payments for income taxes decreased in fiscal year investing activities cash used for investing activities was lower in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily because of the following cash paid for acquisitions in fiscal year totaled compared to the rotex acquisition in fiscal year that required a net cash payment of this represents a decline in cash used for investing activities 
in fiscal year  there was no activity related to the forethought note 
in fiscal year  we received a repayment of of principal on the forethought note 
we received from our auction rate securities and investments in fiscal year  representing an decrease from the prior year 
cash used for investing activities was lower in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily because of the following the rotex acquisition required a net cash payment in fiscal year compared to paid for k tron in the prior year 
this represents a decline in cash used for investing activities 
we received a repayment of of principal on the forethought note in fiscal year there were no receipts of principal in capital project spending was more in fiscal year compared to the prior year 
we received from our auction rate securities and investments in fiscal year  representing a decrease from the prior year 
financing activities cash used in financing activities was higher in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily because of the following we made net repayments under our revolving credit facilities in fiscal year in fiscal year  we had net borrowings of we used of proceeds from the collection of the forethought note to pay down our revolving credit facilities 
we borrowed under our revolving credit facilities to fund the acquisition of rotex 
cash used in financing activities was in fiscal year compared to net cash receipts of in the prior year  primarily because of the following we used of proceeds from the collection of the forethought note to pay down our revolving credit facilities 
we borrowed under our revolving credit facilities to fund the acquisition of rotex 
month outlook we believe that our cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and cash available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund operations  working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements  and financing obligations 
we may use additional cash generated by the business to pay down our revolving credit facility  or we may borrow additional amounts depending on our working capital needs 
as a result  the amount borrowed as of the end of a period may not be representative of the balance during the period 

table of contents the cash at our foreign subsidiaries totaled at september  the majority of these funds represented earnings considered to be permanently reinvested to support the growth strategies of our foreign subsidiaries 
we expect to continue moving forward with our acquisition strategy including the expected close of our acquisition of coperion in early december we plan to fund this acquisition with cash on hand and cash available under our revolving credit facility 
in november  we exercised a feature under the facility to increase our financing capacity by this provided a term loan and increased the maximum revolving feature by to the company also has the potential  under certain circumstances and with the lenders approval  to increase the total amount under the facility by an additional see note for further details 
we did not make discretionary contributions to our pension plans in we are not required  nor do we currently have plans to do so in our minimum required contribution to our pension plan in is we will continue to monitor plan funding levels  performance of the assets within the plan  and overall economic activity  and will make potential funding decisions based on the net impact of the above factors 
we currently expect to pay comparable quarterly cash dividends in the future which will require approximately each quarter based on our outstanding common stock at september  we are currently authorized by our board of directors to purchase additional shares of our common stock  and may elect to do so  depending on market conditions and other needs for cash consistent with our growth strategy 
other liquidity matters on july   we entered into a five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility the facility available in multiple currencies to replace the five year revolving credit facility entered into in march borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at variable rates plus a margin amount based upon our leverage 
in addition  there is a facility fee based upon our leverage 
the new credit facility matures on july  for fiscal years ended september  and  the weighted average interest rates were and 
the availability of borrowings under the facility is subject to our ability at the time of borrowing to meet certain specified conditions 
these conditions include compliance with covenants  absence of default  and continued accuracy of certain representations and warranties 
financial covenants include a maximum ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda of to and a minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of to as of september   we had outstanding letters of credit under the facility  were in compliance with all covenants  and had of remaining borrowing capacity available under the facility 
our swiss location maintains additional availability of through local credit facilities secured by cash or real property 
as of september   there were no borrowings under these facilities and availability was reduced by for outstanding bank guarantees 
at september   we had additional outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees with other financial institutions totaling we had restricted cash of at september  off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation the effect of broad based inflation on the company s revenues and net earnings was not significant in the years ended september    or contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following table summarizes our future obligations as of september  this will help give you an understanding of the significance of cash outlays that are fixed beyond the normal accounts payable we have already incurred and have recorded in the financial statements

table of contents our revolving credit facility expires in july although we may make earlier principal payments  we have reflected the principal balance due at expiration 
cash obligations for interest requirements relate to our fixed rate debt obligation at its contractual rate and borrowings under the variable rate revolving credit facility at its current rate at september  consists of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
defined benefit plan funding represents non discretionary requirements based upon plan funding at september   and excludes any discretionary contributions 
other long term liabilities include the estimated liquidation of liabilities related to our casket pricing obligation  self insurance reserves  and long term severance payments 
we could be called upon by our private equity limited partnership investments to provide a maximum of in additional funds 
critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting policies which require management s judgment are discussed below 
a detailed description of our accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k 
revenue recognition net revenue includes gross revenue less sales discounts  customer rebates  sales incentives  and product returns  all of which require us to make estimates for the portion of these allowances that have yet to be credited or paid to our customers 
we estimate these allowances based upon historical rates and projections of customer purchases toward contractual rebate thresholds 
allowance for doubtful accounts the accounting for our trade receivables requires us to estimate the net realizable value of these assets 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses and collection risk in our existing trade accounts receivable portfolio 
performing our evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires us to exercise significant judgment based on historical write offs and individual customer collection experience 
as a result  the historical experience and current trends we are using in our estimates may not be indicative of the collectability of these balances in the future 
liabilities for loss contingencies related to claims and lawsuits like most companies  we are involved on an ongoing basis in claims  lawsuits  and government proceedings relating to our operations  including environmental  antitrust  patent infringement  business practices  commercial transactions  product and general liability  workers compensation  auto liability  employment  and other matters 
the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty 
an estimated loss from these contingencies is recognized when we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated  however  it is difficult to measure the actual loss that might be incurred related to litigation 
for a more complete description of loss contingencies related to lawsuits  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k 
we are also involved in other possible claims  including product and general liability  workers compensation  auto liability  and employment related matters 
outside insurance companies and third party claims administrators assist in establishing individual claim reserves  and an independent outside actuary provides estimates of ultimate projected losses  including incurred but not reported claims  which are used to establish reserves for losses 
as our actuaries periodically provide us updated ultimate loss projections  we must increase or reduce previously recorded claim reserves 
thus  any one period s financial results could be significantly affected by the effect of this adjustment 
claim reserves for employment related matters are established based upon advice from internal and external counsel and historical settlement information for claims and related fees  when such amounts are considered probable of payment 

table of contents the recorded amounts represent our best estimate of the costs we will incur in relation to such exposures  but it is possible that actual costs could differ from those estimates 
performance based stock compensation the vesting of our performance based stock awards is contingent upon the creation of shareholder value as measured by the cumulative cash returns and final period net operating profit after tax compared to the established hurdle rate over a three year period 
the hurdle rate is a reflection of our weighted average cost of capital and targeted capital structure 
the value of an award is based upon the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
based on the extent to which the performance criteria are achieved  it is possible for none of the awards to vest or for a range up to the maximum to vest  which is reflected in the performance based stock award table in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k 
we record expense associated with the awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period based upon an estimate of projected performance 
the actual performance of the company is evaluated quarterly  and the expense is adjusted according to the new projection if it has changed significantly 
as a result  depending on the degree to which we achieve the performance criteria or our projection changes  our expenses related to the performance based stock awards may become more volatile as we approach the final performance measurement date at the end of the three years 
this increase in volatility stems from the requirement to increase or reduce compensation expense as the projection of performance changes 
thus  any one period s financial results could be significantly affected by the cumulative effect of the adjustment 
preparing the projection of performance requires us to exercise significant judgment as to the expected outcome of final performance up to three years in the future 
in making the projection  we consider both actual results and probable business plans for the future 
at september   we have recorded cumulative compensation expense associated with unvested performance based stock awards of which continues to be subject to periodic adjustments as the related awards approach the final performance measurement date 
retirement and postretirement plans we sponsor retirement and postretirement benefit plans covering the majority of our employees 
expense recognized for the plans is based upon actuarial valuations 
inherent in those valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected returns on assets  and projected future salary rates 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions  participant life span  and withdrawal rates 
these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 
the discount rates used in the valuation of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are evaluated annually based on current market conditions 
in setting the discount rate  we use a yield curve approach to discount each expected cash flow of the liability stream at an interest rate applicable to the timing of each cash flow based on corporate bond rates 
these present values are then converted into an equivalent weighted average discount rate 
our overall expected long term rate of return on pension assets is based on historical and expected future returns  which are inflation adjusted and weighted for the expected return for each component of the investment portfolio 
our rate of assumed compensation increase for pension benefits is also based on our specific historical trends of past wage adjustments in recent years and expectations for the future 
changes in retirement and postretirement benefit expense and the recognized obligations may occur in the future as a result of a number of factors  including changes to any of these assumptions 
our weighted average expected rate of return on pension assets was   and at the end of fiscal years   and a basis point increase in the expected rate of return on domestic pension assets of reduces annual pension expense by at the end of fiscal year  the weighted average discount rate decreased to for the pension plan and for the postretirement healthcare plan 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate increases the annual domestic pension expense by the impact of this decrease to our postretirement healthcare plan expense would be less than impacts from assumption changes could be positive or negative depending on the direction of the change in rates 
based upon the new rates and assumptions  we expect the aggregate expense associated with our defined benefit plans to remain constant from fiscal year to fiscal year at see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k  for key assumptions and other information regarding our retirement and postretirement benefit plans 
uncertain income tax positions in assessing the need for reserves for uncertain tax positions  we have to make judgments regarding the technical merit of a tax position and  when necessary  an estimate of the settlement amount based upon what we think is the probability of the outcome 
at september   we had reserves of established for uncertain tax positions based upon our estimates 
our ability to make and update these estimates is limited to the information we have at any given point in time 
this information can include how taxing authorities have treated the position in the past  how similar cases have settled  or where we are in discussions or negotiations with taxing authorities on a particular issue  among others 
as information available to us evolves  we update our reserves quarterly 
these updates can result in volatility to our income tax rate particularly to a given quarter if new information or developments result in a significant change in our estimate 
business combinations accounting standards require that we record the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
estimating fair value for acquired assets and liabilities as part of a business combination typically requires us to exercise judgment  particularly for those assets and liabilities that may be unique or not easily determined by reference to market data 
often estimates for these types of acquired assets and liabilities will be developed using valuation models that require both historical and forecasted inputs  as well as market participant expectations 
thus the valuation is 
table of contents directly affected by the inputs we judge as best under the given circumstances 
when material  we expect to seek assistance of competent valuation professionals when the underlying valuation is more complex or unique 
we anticipate that in most cases  we will exercise significant judgment in estimating the fair value of intangible assets customer lists or relationships  trademarks  etc  for example  contingent liabilities loss reserves  for example  and contingent consideration earn outs  for example 
this list is not exhaustive  but is designed to give you a better understanding of where we think a larger degree of judgment will be required due to the nature of the item and the way it is typically valued 
depreciable and amortizable lives of long lived assets the recording of depreciation and amortization expense requires management to exercise significant judgment in estimating the economic useful lives of long lived assets  particularly intangible assets 
management s assumptions regarding the following factors  among others  affect the determination of estimated economic useful life management s experience with similar assets  changes in technology  utilization  wear and tear  estimated cash flows expected to be generated by the asset  and changes in market demand 
as our assessment is performed on a periodic basis  changes in any management assumptions may result in a shorter or longer estimated useful life for an asset than originally anticipated 
in such a case  we would depreciate or amortize the remaining net book value of the asset over the new estimated remaining life  thereby increasing or decreasing depreciation or amortization expense per year on a prospective basis 
as a result  our estimates at any point in time may not be indicative of future circumstances 
asset impairment determinations accounting standards require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be tested for impairment at least annually or when circumstances would suggest that impairment may have occurred 
testing of either goodwill or indefinite lived assets requires that we perform either a qualitative assessment or quantitative assessment 
if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value  no further evaluation is necessary 
the qualitative assessment includes evaluating macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  other relevant entity specific or reporting unit events  and a sustained decrease in stock price  if applicable 
if we choose to perform or are required to perform a quantitative assessment  we must estimate the fair value of the asset in question 
if after completing the quantitative assessment  the carrying value more likely than not exceeds the fair value  we must estimate the fair value of the asset in question 
estimating fair value for these assets typically requires us to exercise significant judgment  particularly for asset values that are not easily determined by reference to market data 
often estimates for these types of assets are developed using valuation models that require both historical and forecasted inputs  as well as market participant expectations 
thus the valuation is directly affected by the inputs we judge as best under the given circumstances 
in analyzing the future cash flows of various assets  critical assumptions we make may include some of the following the intended use of assets and the expected cash flows resulting directly from such use  industry specific economic conditions  customer preferences and behavior patterns  and the impact of applicable regulatory initiatives  if any 
our assumptions are sometimes subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we make are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could result in an impairment charge which could materially impact our reported financial results by decreasing operating profit and lowering asset values on our consolidated balance sheet 
when material  we expect to seek assistance of competent valuation professionals when the underlying valuation is more complex or unique 
tangible and other intangible assets that are subject to depreciation and amortization are also evaluated when circumstances suggest that impairment may have occurred 
testing of these assets requires that we estimate future cash flows associated with the assets in question

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this section  we tell you about market risks we think could have a significant impact on our bottom line or the financial strength of our company 
market risks generally mean how results of operations and the value of assets and liabilities could be affected by market factors such as interest rates  currency exchange rates  the value of commodities  and debt and equity price risks 
if those factors change significantly  it could help or hurt our bottom line  depending on how we react to them 
we are exposed to various market risks 
we have established policies  procedures  and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
our primary exposures are to collection risk customer receivables  fluctuations in market prices for certain purchases of commodities  volatility in the fair value of our investments  volatility in the value of our pension plans assets  variability in exchange rates in foreign locations  and volatility in interest rates associated with our revolving credit facility 
we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain purchased commodity raw materials including steel  wood  red metals  and fuel 
while these materials are typically available from multiple suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to market price fluctuations 
we generally buy these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the supplier as part of the purchasing process 
we generally attempt to obtain firm pricing from our larger suppliers for volumes consistent with planned production 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers  or if our suppliers are not able to honor such prices  we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain supply chain efficiencies to offset increases in commodity costs 
we are subject to volatility in our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio includes private equity limited partnerships and common stock with an aggregate carrying value of at september  these investments could be adversely affected by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates  default on debt instruments  and other factors  resulting in an adverse impact 
the changes in the fair value of the limited partnerships underlying investment portfolios can impact us significantly because we record our share of the change in our income statement under the equity method of accounting 
our pension plans assets are also subject to volatility that can be caused by fluctuation in general economic conditions 
plan assets are invested by the plans fiduciaries  which direct investments according to specific policies 
those policies subject investments to the following restrictions in our domestic plan short term securities must be rated a p or higher  fixed income securities must have a quality credit rating of bbb or higher  and investments in equities in any one company may not exceed of the equity portfolio 
our income statement is currently shielded from volatility in plan assets due to the way accounting standards are applied for pension plans  although favorable or unfavorable investment performance over the long term will impact our pension expense if it deviates from our assumption related to future rate of return 
our exposure to exchange rates are primarily i the us dollar versus each of the swiss franc  the euro  the british pound sterling  the canadian dollar  and the swedish krona and ii the swiss franc versus the euro and the british pound sterling 
from time to time we may enter into currency exchange agreements to manage our exposure arising from fluctuating exchange rates related to specific transactions  primarily forecasted intercompany purchasing 
foreign cash balances in currencies other than the swiss franc are limited in order to manage the transaction exposure caused by the marking to market of non swiss franc balances to swiss franc values on the balance sheet of our swiss operations 
as of september   a change in the foreign exchange rates affecting balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a change in pre tax earnings of approximately this hypothetical change on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the september   actual foreign exchange rates and hypothetical rates assuming a change in foreign exchange rates on that date 
the translation of the balance sheets of our non us operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign exchange rates 
these translation gains or losses are recorded as cumulative translation adjustments cta within accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet 
using the example above  the hypothetical change in cta would be calculated by multiplying the net assets of our non us operations by a change in the applicable foreign exchange rates 
the result of this calculation would be to change shareholders equity by approximately as of september  at september   we had outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we are subject to interest rate risk associated with our revolving credit facility which bears a variable rate of interest that is based upon the lender s base rate or the libor rate 
the interest we pay on our borrowings is dependent on interest rate conditions and the timing of our financing needs 
assuming our borrowings remain at for months  a one percentage point move in the related interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately
