item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation forward looking information the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
see the cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of immediately preceding part i of this report 
key components of operating results sources of revenue we derive our revenue almost entirely from the sales of karat jewelry and chinese ornaments and from design and processing fees we receive from other jewelry companies who hire us to design and produce karat jewelry and chinese ornaments using gold they supply us 
we offer a wide range of in house designed products including but not limited to gold necklaces  rings  earrings  bracelets  and pendants 
we only sell on a wholesale basis to distributors and retailers 
pricing of products is made at the time of sale based upon the then current price of gold and sales are made on a cash or credit on delivery basis 
cost of sales our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost for raw materials  primarily  gold 
we purchase gold directly from the shanghai gold exchange  of which we are a member 
we generally do not enter into long term purchase agreements for gold 
during recent years  the price of gold on the international gold market has experienced periods of significant increase 
we have been offsetting the increases in gold price primarily through product pricing adjustments 
we expect that continued rise in gold price would lead to further increase in our cost of sales 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses into four categories selling  general and administrative  stock compensation and depreciation and amortization 
our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  which include salaries  bonuses  taxes and employee benefit costs 
other expenses include advertising and promotional costs  facilities costs and legal  audit and tax  consulting and other professional service fees 
the government owns all of the land in the prc 
companies or individuals are authorized to use the land only through land use rights granted by the prc government 
accordingly  we paid for land use rights in advance and such prepayments are being amortized and recorded as lease expenses using the straight line method over the use terms of the lease 
amortization expense was  and  for and  respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  legal  audit and tax and other professional fees  depreciation expenses  insurance and other corporate expenses 
sales selling expenses consist primarily of freight and transportation expenses  advertising and promotional costs and personnel costs for our sales team 
other income expense  net other income expense  net consists of interest we earn on our cash and cash equivalents  interest expenses on our loans from chinese local banks and fees we pay in connection with guarantees of our loans 

table of contents provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes primarily consists of corporate income taxes related to profits earned in the prc from sales of our products 
in december and  we were awarded the status of a nationally recognized high and new technology enterprise  which entitled us to tax free treatment from january to december starting in january  we became subject to the regular prc corporate tax rate of 
inflation during the past year  inflation rate in china has picked up but has not had a significant effect on the company 
although the chinese government has implemented measures to curb inflation  it is foreseeable that the chinese economy may remain under inflationary pressure at least for the near term 
it is difficult to estimate the impact of continued rise in inflation on us 
on one hand  inflation may lead to  among other things  higher operating expenses for us and erosion of our customers purchase  adversely affecting our results 
on the other hand  inflation may also make our products more attractive to chinese consumers  who traditionally have perceived gold as a safe haven investment from inflation 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
we believe that the following paragraphs reflect our most critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of kingold  its wholly owned subsidiaries  dragon lead and wuhan vogue show and wuhan kingold  its contractually controlled affiliate 
inventories inventories consisting of finished goods  materials on hand  packaging materials and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
the value of finished goods is comprised of direct materials  direct labor and an appropriate proportion of overhead 
cost is determined using the weighted average method 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventories assessing the turnover of our products 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value  cost being calculated on the weighted average basis 
the cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchases  costs of fixed and variable production overheads and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition 
we provide inventory allowances based on excess and obsolete inventories determined principally by customer demand 
we did not record a provision for obsolete inventories as of either december  or december  however  we do realize if the gold price changes substantially in a very short period  it might trigger customer default  resulting in inventory obsolescence 
land use rights under prc law  all land in the prc is owned by the government and cannot be sold to an individual or company 
the government grants individuals and companies the right to use parcels of land for specified periods of time 
these land use rights are sometimes referred to informally as ownership 
land use rights are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is provided over the respective useful lives  using the straight line method 
estimated useful lives is years  and are determined in the connection with the term of the land use right 

table of contents property  plant and equipment plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is provided over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
the estimated useful lives and residual values are as follows

estimated useful life buildings years plant and machinery years motor vehicles years office furniture and electronic equipment years the cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the account and any gain or loss is included in the statement of income for that period 
the cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to income as incurred  whereas material renewals and betterments are capitalized 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets the long lived assets held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
it is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes 
the recoverability value of an asset to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying amount of such asset against the future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset 
our principal long lived assets are our property  plant and equipment assets 
we must make various assumptions and estimates regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
we use set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management  and estimate the fair value of our reporting units by using undiscounted cash flow analyses 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for the underlying assets at such time 
any such resulting impairment charges could be material to our results of operations 
if the value of such an asset is determined to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value  less disposition costs 
no events or changes in our business or circumstances required us to test for impairment of our long lived assets during and  and accordingly  we did not recognize any impairment loss during these periods 
competitive pricing pressure and changes in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by our long lived assets  and thus could result in future impairment losses 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from the sales price of goods sold and fees for services provided 
we recognize revenue for goods sold when they are delivered to the customer 
we recognize revenue for services provided when the services have been performed  the customers have approved the completion of services  invoices have been issued and collectability is deemed probable 
management has not made an allowance for estimated sales returns because they are considered immaterial when viewed in light of our overall revenue and historical experience 
in recognizing revenue  we assume that the currency we receive from customers is valid legal tender in the prc  our electronic record keeping system has not been tampered with nor malfunctioned  and that we have not inadvertently sold significant amounts of defective goods 
if any of these assumptions were proven to be incorrect  we could have to restate our revenue 
as of the end of  none of these assumptions have proven to be incorrect

table of contents net sales fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  increased to million  an increase of million  or  from net sales of million for the year ended december  the increase in net sales was primarily driven by the increased amount of products sold as well as by the increase in the price of gold 
of the million increase  approximately million was attributable to increases in production and approximately million was attributable to the increase in the price of gold and the remaining million was due to the translation gain as the rmb approximately appreciated against usd between and overall  china s gold market has witnessed strong growth in according to world gold council  total demand in china has amounted to tons in  up year on year as a result of increases in both jewelry and investment gold 
the largest rise was in investment gold  where demand was tons with the value of rmbbillion growing 
more specifically  the increase in net sales was mainly attributable to the fact that we raised approximately million in net proceeds from the public offering that closed in mid january and used the full amount to purchase gold used to increase branded production so we can take more orders to meet strong demand from customers 
the gold purchased with these funds was put into production at the end of january and was in full production as of the end of the second quarter 
as a result  branded production increased substantially from metric tons for the twelve months ended december  to metric tons for the twelve months ended december  in branded production  the cost of gold is passed through to our clients and recorded as a part of sales 
we signed agreements with two major chinese national banks  the bank of communications and china merchant bank and one major regional bank wuhan rural commercial bank  to enter the investment gold business  which primarily include gold coins  bars and certain gold gift products 
this new business is still in the experimental stage and has not yet had a major impact on our revenue 
sales for the banking business have totaled million in versus million in in  we also have expanded our business into new geographic regions in china and gained new clients  particularly in northeast china 
our business has covered provinces and municipalities in china and we intend to continue the efforts to penetrate into more provinces in china in cost of sales cost of sales for the year ended december  increased to million  an increase of million  or from million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to the increased price of gold and the increased amount of gold required to fulfill our increased sales volume for the year ended december  of the million increase  the increased cost due to increased gold price was approximately million  and the increased cost due to increased amount of gold purchased for expanded production was approximately million and remaining million was to the translation gain from rbm into usd during for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million  an increase of million  or  from million for the same period in the increase in our gross profit was primarily due to the increase in sales volume 
gross margin for the year ended december  was  compared to for the same period in gross profit drops mainly because of the following reasons product mix shift slightly more toward branded production 
branded production accounted for of total production metric tons in and accounted for of total production metric tons in  the more branded production as percentage of total sales  the lower for the total gross margin  as gross margin for branded production is normally around while gross margin for customized production is normally around 
gold price increased significantly between and and  the company could not raise the processing fee proportionally  the company pulled out the distribution centers in shen zhen and beijing in the fourth quarter and needed to clearance the inventory 

table of contents expenses for the year ended december  total operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or  from million for the same period in interest expense was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or  from million for same period in our provision for income tax expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to our increased income from operations 
other comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders was approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million for the year ended december  was due to foreign currency translation gains in in  the rmb appreciated substantially against the dollar 
net income net income attributable to common stockholders increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  an increase of million  or as result of the matters described above 
cash flow net cash provided by used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the same period in the reason for the change in cash used in operating activities was because of two major factors as compared to our inventory balance as of december   our inventory increased by million over the twelve months ending december  due primarily to our enlarged demand in  and our net income was million  as we significantly expanded our business in analysis and expectations 
our net cash from operating activities can fluctuate significantly due to changes in our inventories 
other factors that may vary significantly include our accounts payable  purchases of gold and income taxes 
looking forward  we expect the net cash that we generate from operating activities to continue to fluctuate as our inventories  receivables  accounts payables and the other factors described above change with increased production and the purchase of larger quantities of raw materials 
these fluctuations could cause net cash from operating activities to fall  even if  as we expect  our net income grows as we continue to expand 
although we expect that net cash from operating activities will rise over the long term  we cannot predict how these fluctuations will affect our cash flow in any particular accounting period 
net cash provided by used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to  for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of  for the year ended december  analysis and expectations 
our net cash used in investing activities did not fluctuate significantly in the comparable periods 
we do not expect that cash used in investing activities will increase significantly in the short term future as we have invested sufficiently in property and equipment and we expect our current production capacity will also be sufficient to meet our growing production need in the near future 
however  we might purchase some small working tools in connection with increased hiring for our as a result of production expansion 
net cash provided by used in financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  the change was primarily due to our public offering of million shares in january 
table of contents analysis and expectations 
we expect that cash generated from financing activities may increase significantly as a result of additional financing being obtained to meet the needs of expanded production 
foreign currency translations we use the us dollar as the reporting currency for our financial statements 
our operations are conducted through our prc operating subsidiary  vogue show  and our functional currency is the renminbi rmb 
foreign currency transactions during the year are translated to the rmb at the approximate rates of exchange on the dates of transactions 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies on the balance sheet are translated at the approximate rates of exchange at the respective balance sheet date 
non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time that the asset or liability was acquired 
exchange gains or losses are recorded in the statement of operations 
our financial statements are translated into us dollars using the closing rate method 
the balance sheet items are translated into us dollars using the exchange rates at the respective balance sheet dates 
the capital and various reserves are translated at historical exchange rates prevailing at the time of the transactions while income and expenses items are translated at the average exchange rate for the year 
all gains and losses attributable to foreign currency exchange are recorded within equity 
the exchange rates used to translate amounts in rmb into us dollars for the purposes of preparing the financial statements were as follows

no representation is made that rmb amounts have been  or could be  converted into us dollars at the above rates or at all 
although the chinese government regulations now allow convertibility of rmb for current account transactions  significant restrictions still remain 
hence  such translations should not be construed as representations that rmb can be converted into us dollars at the above conversion rate  or any other rate 
the value of rmb against us dollar and other currencies may fluctuate  and is affected by  among other things  changes in china s political and economic conditions 
any significant revaluation of rmb may materially affect our financial condition in terms of us dollar reporting 
liquidity and capital resources at the year end of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we have historically financed our operations with cash flow generated from operations  as well as through bank loans with a term of one year 
at the year end of december   we had outstanding short term loan from citic bank corporation limited in an aggregate amount of million with an interest rate of due in november our loans are secured by all the company s buildings  plant and machinery 
the amounts outstanding under these bank loans are presented in our financial statements as short term loans 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report 
at the year end of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we have historically financed our operations with cash flow generated from operations  as well as through bank loans with a term of one year 
at december   we had outstanding short term loans from shanghai pudong development bank in an aggregate amount of million with an interest rate of due in may our loans are secured by buildings  plant and machinery and or guaranteed by non affiliates

table of contents outstanding under these bank loans are presented in our financial statements as short term loans 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report 
in china  it is customary practice for banks and borrowers to negotiate roll overs or renewals of short term borrowings on an on going basis shortly before they mature 
although we have renewed our short term borrowings in the past  we cannot assure that we will be able to renew these loans in the future as they mature 
if we are unable to obtain renewals of these loans or sufficient alternative funding on reasonable terms from banks or other parties  we will have to repay these borrowings with the cash on our balance sheet or cash generated by our future operations  if any 
we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay these borrowing or that additional debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to maintain financing arrangements on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that our current cash and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs  including our cash needs for working capital  for the next months 
we may  however  require additional cash resources due to changing business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity depends partially on our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue  while continuing to control costs 
if we do not have sufficient available cash  we would have to seek additional debt or equity financing through other external sources  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to maintain financing arrangements on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are required to contribute a portion of our employees total salaries to the chinese government s social insurance funds  including pension insurance  medical insurance  unemployment insurance  job injuries insurance  and maternity insurance  in accordance with relevant regulations 
we expect that the amount of our contribution to the government s social insurance funds will increase in the future as we expand our workforce and operations and commence contributions to an employee housing fund 
the ability of vogue show to pay dividends may be restricted due to the prc s foreign exchange control policies and our availability of cash 
a majority of our revenue being earned and currency received is denominated in rmb 
we may be unable to distribute any dividends outside of china due to prc exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert rmb into us dollars 
accordingly  vogue show s funds may not be readily available to us to satisfy obligations which have been incurred outside the prc  which could adversely affect our business and prospects or our ability to meet our cash obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet transactions 
recent accounting pronouncements we do not believe that any recently issued  but not yet effective  accounting standards  if currently adopted  will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk given that substantially all of our revenues are generated in chinese rmb  yet our results are reported in us dollars  devaluation of the rmb could negatively impact our results of operations 
the value of rmb is subject to changes in china s governmental policies and to international economic and political developments 
in january  the prc government implemented a unitary managed floating rate system 
under this system  the people s bank of china  or pboc  began publishing a daily base exchange rate with reference primarily to the supply and demand of rmb against the us dollar and other foreign currencies in the market during the previous day 
authorized banks and financial institutions are allowed to quote buy and sell rates for rmb within a specified band around the central bank s daily exchange rate 
on july   pboc announced an adjustment of the exchange rate of the us dollar to rmb from to and modified the system by which the exchange rates are determined 
over the past four years  rmb has appreciated 
table of contents against the usd from usd rmb on january st  to usd rmb on december st  
while the international reaction to the rmb revaluation has generally been positive  there remains significant international pressure on the prc government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy  which could result in further fluctuations of the exchange rate of rmb against the us dollar  including possible devaluations 
as all of our net revenues are recorded in rmb  any future devaluation of rmb against the us dollar could negatively impact our results of operations 
along these lines  the income statements of our operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currencies denominated transactions results in reduced revenue  operating expenses and net income for our international operations 
similarly  to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased revenue  operating expenses and net income for our international operations 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss which is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
in addition  we have certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations that will lead to a transaction gain or loss 
we have not entered into agreements or purchased instruments to hedge our exchange rate risks  although we may do so in the future 
the availability and effectiveness of any hedging transaction may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exchange rate risks 
interest rate risk our notes payable to banks for short term borrowings as of december  and were approximately million  and million  respectively 
interest expense paid for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  and fees paid to a third party guarantor for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
at december   our weighted average interest rate was 
we currently have no interest rate hedge positions in place to reduce our exposure to interest rates 
commodity price risk most of our sales are of products that include gold  precious metals and other commodities  and fluctuations in the availability and pricing of commodities would adversely impact our ability to obtain and make products at favorable prices 
the jewelry industry generally is affected by fluctuations in the price and supply of diamonds  gold  and  to a lesser extent  other precious and semi precious metals and stones 
in the past  we have not hedged our requirement for gold or other raw materials through the use of options  forward contracts or outright commodity purchasing  although we may do so in the future 
a significant increase in the price of gold could increase our production costs beyond the amount that we are able to pass on to our customers  which would adversely affect our sales and profitability 
a significant disruption in our supply of gold  or other commodities could decrease our production and shipping levels  materially increase our operating costs and materially and adversely affect our profit margins 
shortages of gold  or other commodities  or interruptions in transportation systems  labor strikes  work stoppages  war  acts of terrorism  or other interruptions to or difficulties in the employment of labor or transportation in the markets in which we purchase our raw materials  may adversely affect our ability to maintain production of our products and sustain profitability 
although we generally attempt to pass increased commodity prices to our customers  there may be circumstances in which we are not able to do so 
in addition  if we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of gold  we would be unable to meet our production schedules and to ship products to our customers in a timely manner  which would adversely affect our sales  margins and customer relations 
furthermore  the value of our inventory may be affected by commodity prices 
we record the value of our inventory using the weighted average method 
as a result  decreases in the market value of precious metals such as gold would result in a lower stated value of our inventory  which may require us to take a charge for the decrease in the value of our inventory
