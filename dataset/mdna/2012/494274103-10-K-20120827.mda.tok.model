item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview kimball international  inc provides a variety of products from its two business segments the electronic manufacturing services ems segment and the furniture segment 
the ems segment provides engineering and manufacturing services which utilize common production and support capabilities globally to the medical  automotive  industrial  and public safety industries 
the furniture segment provides furniture for the office and hospitality industries  sold under the company s family of brand names 
projections for calendar year by idc and ihs isuppli in january reported a range of projected growth from flat to in the ems industry 
in addition  the semiconductor industry association sia reported in january that semiconductor sales are projected to have low single digit growth in calendar year  and although the company does not directly serve this market  it may be indicative of the end market demand for products utilizing electronic components 
more recent ems industry outlooks have not been widely published as there are no clear trends defining the industry this year as the various markets have mixed outlooks 
the company focuses on the four key vertical markets of medical  automotive  industrial  and public safety in the ems segment 
this segment s overall demand continues to stabilize  but is mixed 
the automotive end market is benefiting from relative strength in the us market while demand in other geographies such as europe is less certain due to the impact of the european debt crisis 
the industrial market demand is improving but continues to reflect a lower demand for heating  cooling  and ventilation hvac products than historical levels 
demand in the medical and public safety markets remains stable 
as of june  the business and institutional furniture manufacturer association bifma forecasted a year over year increase in the office furniture industry for calendar year of with improved growth of forecast for calendar year the hospitality furniture market forecasts june reports by smith travel research and pricewaterhousecoopers llp project an approximate increase in occupancy rates and an approximate increase in revenue per available room revpar for calendar year competitive pricing pressures continue to burden the operating margins of select areas within both segments of the company s operations 
the company is committed to ensuring it sustains the cost efficiencies and process improvements undertaken during the recession 
in addition  a long standing component of the company s profit sharing incentive bonus plan is that it is linked to the company s worldwide  group  or business unit performance which adjusts compensation expense as profits change 
the focus on cost control continues 
at the same time  the company plans to continue to invest in capital expenditures prudently for projects in support of both organic growth and potential acquisitions that would enhance the company s capabilities and diversification while providing an opportunity for growth and improved profitability 
the company also continues to closely monitor market changes and its liquidity in order to proactively adjust its operating costs  discretionary capital spending  and dividend levels as needed 
managing working capital in conjunction with fluctuating demand levels is likewise key 
the company continued to maintain a strong balance sheet as of the end of fiscal year  which included minimal long term debt of million and share owners equity of million 
the company s short term liquidity available  represented as cash and cash equivalents plus the unused amount of the company s revolving credit facility  was million at june  in addition to the above discussion related to the current market conditions  management currently considers the following events  trends  and uncertainties to be most important to understanding the company s financial condition and operating performance while certain sectors are showing signs of economic recovery  the macroeconomic environment remains volatile as a result of continued uncertainty related to the european debt crisis  the upcoming us elections  and the potential tax increases and spending cuts looming at the end of calendar year the uncertainty tends to cause disruption in business strategy  execution  and timing in many of the markets in which the company competes 
the nature of the ems industry is such that the start up of new programs to replace departing customers or expiring programs occurs frequently 
as previously announced  the company s sales to bayer ag began to decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as the company s primary manufacturing contract with bayer ag expired 
margins on the bayer ag product were generally lower than the company s other ems products 
the company continues to manufacture other products for bayer ag 
the success of the company s ems segment is dependent on the successful replacement of such customers or programs 
such changes usually occur gradually over time as old programs phase out of production while newer programs ramp up 
the transition to new programs may temporarily reduce sales and increase operating costs  resulting in a temporary decline in operating profit at the impacted business unit 
inflation has moderated and does not appear to be a significant risk in the near term  but the company continues to focus on mitigating the impact of raw material commodity pricing pressures 
the healthcare reform legislation that was signed into law in march and upheld by the supreme court in june is expected to increase the company s healthcare and related administrative expenses as the provisions of the law become effective over the next couple of years 
globalization continues to reshape not only the industries in which the company operates but also its key customers and competitors 
the company s employees throughout its business operations are an integral part of the company s ability to compete successfully  and the stability of its management team is critical to long term share owner value 
the company s career development and succession planning processes help to maintain stability in management 
certain preceding statements could be considered forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  a significant change in economic conditions  loss of key customers or suppliers  or similar unforeseen events 
fiscal year results of operations financial overview consolidated fiscal year consolidated net sales were billion compared to fiscal year net sales of billion  a decrease  resulting from a net sales decrease in the ems segment which more than offset a net sales increase in the furniture segment 
fiscal year net income was million  or per class b diluted share  inclusive of million  or per class b diluted share  of after tax restructuring costs primarily related to the european consolidation plan 
the company recorded net income for fiscal year of million  or per class b diluted share  inclusive of million  or per class b diluted share  of after tax restructuring costs primarily related to the european consolidation plan 
consolidated gross profit as a percent of net sales improved to for fiscal year from in fiscal year due to margin improvement in both the ems and furniture segments coupled with a shift in sales mix as depicted in the table below toward the furniture segment which operates at a higher gross profit percentage than the ems segment 
gross profit is discussed in more detail in the segment discussions below 
segment net sales as a of consolidated net sales year ended june ems segment furniture segment fiscal year consolidated selling and administrative expenses decreased in absolute dollars  but increased as a percent of net sales  compared to fiscal year  on decreased operating leverage due to lower revenue 
the company recorded million less expense within selling and administrative expenses in fiscal year than fiscal year related to the normal revaluation to fair value of the company s supplemental employee retirement plan serp liability 
the revaluation of the serp liability recorded in selling and administrative expenses is exactly offset by the revaluation of the serp investment recorded in other income expense  therefore  there was no effect on net earnings 
employee contributions comprise approximately of the serp investment 
partially offsetting the lower serp expense was an increase in incentive compensation expenses in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year fiscal year other expense totaled million compared to other income of million for fiscal year other income expense consisted of the following other income expense year ended june amounts in thousands interest income interest expense foreign currency derivative gain loss gain loss on supplemental employee retirement plan investment impairment loss on privately held investment impairment loss on convertible debt securities gain loss on stock warrants other other income expense  net the impairment loss on privately held investment  the impairment loss on convertible debt securities  and the gain loss on stock warrants listed in the table above all relate to the company s investment in one privately held company

comparing the balance sheet as of june  to june   the decrease in accounts receivable was a result of the company s lower sales levels and a shift in the payment practices of three large ems segment customers during fiscal year which favorably impacted the company s accounts receivable balance 
a reduction in the company s inventory balance was primarily the result of successful inventory reduction initiatives in both segments  and the company s accounts payable balances declined in conjunction with the reduced inventory levels 
the decreased accrued expenses balance was primarily driven by a decline in accrued compensation and a decline in accrued restructuring as the european consolidation plan was completed during fiscal year electronic manufacturing services segment ems segment results follow at or for the year ended june amounts in millions change net sales operating income operating income net income restructuring expense  net of tax open orders fiscal year ems segment net sales to customers in the medical  industrial  and public safety industries decreased compared to fiscal year which more than offset an increase in net sales to customers in the automotive industry 
the decline in net sales to the medical industry was attributable to the expiration of a contract with one medical customer bayer ag late in fiscal year which accounted for a million decline in net sales in fiscal year excluding this customer  net sales to the medical industry  as well as the overall ems segment net sales  increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year open orders as of june  were up compared to june  however  open orders at a point in time may not be indicative of future sales trends due to the contract nature of the company s business 
fiscal year ems segment gross profit as a percent of net sales improved percentage points when compared to fiscal year the improvement was primarily driven by the benefit from a sales mix shift toward higher margin product and benefits realized related to restructuring activities in which two facilities were closed during the second quarter of fiscal year ems segment selling and administrative expenses in absolute dollars decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  but increased as a percent of net sales on the lower sales volumes 
the selling and administrative expenses declined primarily due to benefits realized from restructuring activities within this segment 
the previously announced exit of the company s small assembly facility located in fremont  california was completed during fiscal year along with the associated move of a majority of that business to the jasper  indiana facility 
in addition  the previously announced consolidation of the company s european ems facilities was likewise completed during fiscal year see

this contract accounted for a majority of the sales to bayer ag during fiscal year margins on the bayer ag product were generally lower than the company s other ems products 
the nature of the electronic manufacturing services industry is such that the start up of new customers and new programs to replace expiring programs occurs frequently 
new customer and program start ups generally cause losses early in the life of a program  which are generally recovered as the program becomes established and matures 
this segment continues to experience margin pressures related to an overall excess capacity position in the electronics subcontracting services market 
risk factors within the ems segment include  but are not limited to  general economic and market conditions  customer order delays  increased globalization  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  rapid technological changes  component availability  supplier stability  the contract nature of this industry  the concentration of sales to large customers  and the potential for customers to choose a dual sourcing strategy or to in source a greater portion of their electronics manufacturing 
the continuing success of this segment is dependent upon its ability to replace expiring customers programs with new customers programs

during fiscal year  the company reinvested million into capital investments for the future  largely for manufacturing equipment within both segments 
the company also paid million of dividends in fiscal year consistent with the company s historical dividend policy  the company s board of directors will evaluate the appropriate dividend payment on a quarterly basis 
during fiscal year  the company expects to continue to invest in capital expenditures prudently  particularly for projects including potential acquisitions that would enhance the company s capabilities and diversification while providing an opportunity for growth and improved profitability 
at june  and june   the company had no short term borrowings outstanding under its million credit facility described in more detail below 
the company also has several smaller foreign credit facilities available described in more detail below and likewise had no borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of june  or june  at june   the company had million contingently committed in letters of credit against the million credit facility 
total availability to borrow under the million credit facility was million at june  the company maintains the million credit facility with an expiration date in april that allows for both issuances of letters of credit and cash borrowings 
the million credit facility provides an option to increase the amount available for borrowing to million at the company s request  subject to the consent of the participating banks 
the million credit facility  upon which there were no borrowings at june   requires the company to comply with certain debt covenants  the most significant of which are the interest coverage ratio and minimum net worth 
the company was in compliance with the debt covenants during the fiscal year ended june  the table below compares the actual net worth and interest coverage ratio with the limits specified in the credit agreement 
covenant at or for the period ended june  limit as specified in credit agreement excess minimum net worth interest coverage ratio the interest coverage ratio is calculated on a rolling four quarter basis as defined in the credit agreement 
in addition to the million credit facility  the company can opt to utilize foreign credit facilities which are available to satisfy short term cash needs at a specific foreign location rather than funding from intercompany sources 
the company maintains a foreign credit facility for its ems segment operation in thailand which is backed by the million revolving credit facility 
the company has a credit facility for its ems segment operation in poland  which allows for multi currency borrowings up to million euro equivalent approximately million us dollars at june  exchange rates 
these foreign credit facilities can be canceled at any time by either the bank or the company 
the company believes its principal sources of liquidity from available funds on hand  cash generated from operations  and the availability of borrowing under the company s credit facilities will be sufficient for fiscal year and the foreseeable future 
one of the company s sources of funds is its ability to generate cash from operations to meet its liquidity obligations which could be adversely affected in the future by factors such as general economic and market conditions  lack of availability of raw material components in the supply chain  a decline in demand for the company s products  loss of key contract customers  the ability of the company to generate profits  and other unforeseen circumstances 
in particular  should demand for the company s products decrease significantly over the next months  the available cash provided by operations could be adversely impacted 
another source of funds is the company s credit facilities 
the company expects to renew or negotiate a new credit facility to replace the current million credit facility prior to its april expiration 
however  a new or negotiated renewal of the credit facility may be less favorable in terms of borrowing costs than the current facility due to the impact that the current economic conditions have had on borrowing in general 
in addition  changing conditions in the credit markets  prohibitive costs  or other unforeseen circumstances could adversely impact the renewal or replacement of this facility 
during fiscal year there were no borrowings on the credit facility  and costs related to the credit facility were not significant 
the preceding statements include forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements 
fair value during fiscal year  no level or level financial instruments were affected by a lack of market liquidity 
for level financial assets  readily available market pricing was used to value the financial instruments 
the company s foreign currency derivatives  which were classified as level assets liabilities  were independently valued using observable market inputs such as forward interest rate yield curves  current spot rates  and time value calculations 
to verify the reasonableness of the independently determined fair values  these derivative fair values were compared to fair values calculated by the counterparty banks 
the company s own credit risk and counterparty credit risk had an immaterial impact on the valuation of the foreign currency derivatives 
during fiscal year  the company purchased convertible debt securities of million and stock warrants of million of a privately held company 
during fiscal year  the convertible debt securities experienced an other than temporary decline in fair market value resulting in a million impairment loss and  upon a qualified financing  were subsequently converted to non marketable equity securities 
also during fiscal year  the revaluation of stock warrants resulted in a million derivative gain as a result of the qualified financing 
during fiscal year  the privately held company experienced delays in their start up  and therefore initiated another round of financing that the company chose not to participate in  which resulted in the automatic conversion of preferred shares and warrants to common shares and warrants 
upon the conversion  the equity securities and warrants were revalued  resulting in an impairment loss of million on the equity securities and a million derivative loss on the stock warrants during fiscal year the investment in non marketable equity securities is accounted for as a cost method investment which carries the securities at cost 
in the event of impairment  the valuation uses a probability weighted black scholes option pricing model 
the stock warrants are classified as derivative instruments and are valued on a recurring basis using a market based approach which utilizes a probability weighted black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value measurements for stock warrants and the impairment of non marketable equity securities were calculated using unobservable inputs and were classified as level financial assets

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
management uses its best judgment in the assumptions used to value these estimates  which are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience  and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
the company s management overlays a fundamental philosophy of valuing its assets and liabilities in an appropriately conservative manner 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and are the policies that are most critical in the portrayal of the company s financial position and results of operations 
management has discussed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and with the company s independent registered public accounting firm

at june  and june   the reserve for returns and allowances was million and million  respectively 
the returns and allowances reserve approximated to of gross trade receivables during fiscal years and allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts is generally based on a percentage of aged accounts receivable  where the percentage increases as the accounts receivable become older 
however  management judgment is utilized in the final determination of the allowance based on several factors including specific analysis of a customer s credit worthiness  changes in a customer s payment history  historical bad debt experience  and general economic and market trends 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at june  and june  was million and million  respectively 
this reserve approximated of gross trade accounts receivable during fiscal years and excess and obsolete inventory inventories were valued using the lower of last in  first out lifo cost or market value for approximately and of consolidated inventories at june  and june   respectively  including approximately and of the furniture segment inventories at june  and june   respectively

in general  the company purchases materials and finished goods for contract based business from customer orders and projections  primarily in the case of long lead time items  and has a general philosophy to only purchase materials to the extent covered by a written commitment from its customers 
however  there are times when inventory is purchased beyond customer commitments due to minimum lot sizes and inventory lead time requirements  or where component allocation or other procurement issues exist 
the company may also purchase additional inventory to support transfers of production between manufacturing facilities 
evaluation of excess inventory includes such factors as anticipated usage  inventory turnover  inventory levels  and product demand levels 
factors considered when evaluating inventory obsolescence include the age of on hand inventory and reduction in value due to damage  use as showroom samples  design changes  or cessation of product lines 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured up to certain limits for auto and general liability  workers compensation  and certain employee health benefits such as medical  short term disability  and dental with the related liabilities included in the accompanying financial statements 
the company s policy is to estimate reserves based upon a number of factors including known claims  estimated incurred but not reported claims  and other analyses  which are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions for such matters as increased medical costs and changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change and reserve levels to be adjusted accordingly 
at june  and june   the company s accrued liabilities for self insurance exposure were million and million  respectively 
taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
these assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize its deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  the company provides a valuation allowance based on its best estimate of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes ultimately realizable 
future events could change management s assessment 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
however  the company believes it has made adequate provision for income and other taxes for all years that are subject to audit 
as tax periods are effectively settled  the provision will be adjusted accordingly

equity risk the company holds an investment in the non marketable equity securities and stock warrants of a privately held company 
if the private company experiences certain events or circumstances  such as the loss of customers  the inability to achieve growth initiatives  or if there are factors beyond its control in the markets which it serves  the private company s performance could be affected materially resulting in a loss of some or all of its value  which could result in an other than temporary impairment of the investment 
if an other than temporary impairment of fair value would occur  the investment would be adjusted down to its fair value and an impairment charge would be recognized in earnings 
during fiscal year  the privately held company experienced delays in their start up  and therefore initiated another round of financing that the company chose not to participate in  which resulted in the automatic conversion of preferred shares and warrants to common shares and warrants 
upon the conversion  the equity securities and warrants were revalued  resulting in an impairment loss of million on the equity securities and a million derivative loss on stock warrants 
during fiscal year  the equity securities experienced an other than temporary decline in fair market value resulting in a million impairment loss  and the revaluation of stock warrants in conjunction with a qualified financing resulted in a million derivative gain 
the non marketable equity investment had a carrying amount of million and million as of june  and  respectively  and the stock warrants had a carrying amount of million and million as of june  and  respectively
