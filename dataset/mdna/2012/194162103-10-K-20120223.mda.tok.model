item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview and outlook and note to the consolidated financial statements 
uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business 
uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business 
recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues  profitability and cash flow 
although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands  during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands  which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings 
additionally  retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lower priced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins 
for example  continuing economic uncertainty in europe  and a worsening of the debt crisis there  could negatively affect consumer confidence globally 
while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities  any disruption in the credit markets  including in europe  could limit the availability of credit or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit  which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital 
if any financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements  such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments  were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent  they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us 
this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures 
in addition  tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers  contract manufacturers or trade customers which could  in turn  adversely impact our business 
significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 
we face vigorous competition around the world  including from other large  multinational companies  some of which have greater resources than we do 
we face this competition in several aspects of our business  including  but not limited to  the pricing of products  promotional activities and new product introductions 
such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising 
our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to defend our patent  trademark and trade dress rights against legal challenges brought by competitors 
we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully counteract them  which could harm our business 
in addition  the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges  both in terms of management time and out of pocket expenses  may affect our performance in the relevant period 
a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability 
changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business 
our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large format retailers and discounters 
with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation  we are increasingly dependent on key retailers  and some of these retailers  including large format retailers  may have greater bargaining strength than we do 
they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts  allowances or slotting fees  which could lead to reduced sales or profitability 
also  tighter credit or capital markets could negatively affect our retail customers and as a result  affect our working capital 
we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers  such as inventory de stocking  limitations on access to shelf space  delisting of our products  environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions 
in addition  private label products sold by retail trade chains  which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products  are a source of competition for certain of our product lines  including liquid hand soaps and shower gels 
the growth of our business depends on the successful development and introduction of innovative new products 
our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions  which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors 
in addition  our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully develop and fund technological innovations  obtain and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others  obtain approvals and registrations of regulated products  including from the us food and drug administration fda and other regulatory bodies in the us and abroad  and anticipate consumer needs and preferences 
the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in the company not being the first to market  which could compromise our competitive position 
volatility in material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability 
raw and packaging material commodities such as resins  tropical oils  essential oils  tallow  corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations 
increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy  transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution 
in addition  our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers 
for certain materials  new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry  government and colgate standards  which can require additional investment and take some period of time 
while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate  global economic conditions  supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of  or prices for  those raw materials 
damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business 
maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products 
accordingly  we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation  such as our ethics and compliance  sustainability  brand protection and product safety  regulatory and quality initiatives 
in addition  from time to time  third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products  which are inferior or may pose safety risks 
as a result  consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products  which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business 
similarly  adverse publicity regarding our responses to health concerns  our environmental impacts  including packaging  energy and water use and waste management  or other sustainability issues  whether or not deserved  could jeopardize our reputation 
damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business  as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation 
our business is subject to product liability claims 
from time to time the company may be subject to product liability claims alleging  among other things  that its products cause damage to property or persons  provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or contain design or manufacturing defects or contaminants 
for example  the company has been named in product liability actions alleging that certain talc products it sold prior to were contaminated with asbestos  causing harm to consumers 
in addition  if one of the company s products  or a raw material contained in our products  is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe  we may need to recall some of our products 
whether or not a product liability claim is successful  or a recall required  such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image 
our business is subject to regulation in the us and abroad 
our business is subject to extensive regulation in the us and abroad 
such regulation applies to most aspects of our products  including their development  ingredients  manufacture  packaging  labeling  storage  transportation  distribution  export  import  advertising and sale 
also  our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroad 
us federal authorities  including the food and drug administration fda  the federal trade commission  the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency epa  regulate different aspects of our business  along with parallel authorities at the state and local level and comparable authorities overseas 
while it is our policy and practice to comply with all regulatory requirements applicable to our business  a finding that we are in violation of  or out of compliance with  applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies  including fines  damages  injunctions or product recalls  or criminal sanctions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
even if a claim is unsuccessful  is without merit or is not fully pursued  the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products  processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image 
for information regarding our european competition matters  see item  legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  new or more stringent regulations  or more restrictive interpretations of existing regulations  could have a material adverse impact on our business 
for example  from time to time  various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in europe  the us and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products 
triclosan  an ingredient used primarily in colgate total toothpaste as well as certain other oral care products and soaps  is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities around the world 
a finding by a regulatory authority that triclosan  or any other of our ingredients  should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated  could have a material adverse impact on our business  as could negative reactions by our consumers  trade customers or non governmental organizations to our use of such ingredients 
additionally  an inability to timely obtain regulatory approval of new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients could likewise have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activities 
the company is engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale 
we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities  including  but not limited to industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues  environmental events  strikes and other labor disputes  disruptions in logistics  loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites  raw material and product quality or safety issues  the impact on our suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets  and natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control 
while we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials  significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and  if not remedied  have an adverse impact on our business 
a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact the company s ability to conduct business 
the company relies extensively on information technology systems  including some which rely on third party service providers  in order to conduct its business 
these systems include  but are not limited to  programs and processes relating to communicating within the company and with other parties  ordering and managing materials from suppliers  converting materials to finished products  shipping products to customers  processing transactions  summarizing and reporting results of operations  complying with regulatory legal or tax requirements and other processes involved in managing the business 
although the company has network security measures in place  the systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses  security breaches and other similar disruptions from unauthorized users 
while the company has business continuity plans in place  if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes  including the poor performance or failure of third party service providers  catastrophic events  power outages  security breaches  network outages  failed upgrades or other similar events  and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis  the company may suffer interruptions in the ability to manage or conduct business which may adversely impact the company s business 
our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management 
our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees 
if we are unable to attract and retain talented  highly qualified senior management and other key people  our future operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management  including our chief executive officer  our business may be materially adversely affected 
while we follow a disciplined  ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives  these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time

item legal proceedings as a global company serving consumers in more than countries and territories  the company is routinely subject to a wide variety of legal proceedings 
these include disputes relating to intellectual property  contracts  product liability  marketing  advertising  foreign exchange controls  antitrust and trade regulation  as well as labor and employment  environmental and tax matters 
management proactively reviews and monitors the company s exposure to  and the impact of  environmental matters 
the company is party to various environmental matters and  as such  may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup  restoration and post closure monitoring of several sites 
as a matter of course  the company is regularly audited by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities around the world in countries where it conducts business 
in this regard  all us federal income tax returns through december  have been audited by the irs and there are limited matters in administrative appeals for years through  the settlement of which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
with a few exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us  state and local income tax examinations for the years prior to in addition  the company has subsidiaries in various foreign jurisdictions that have statutes of limitations for tax audits generally ranging from three to six years 
estimated incremental tax payments related to potential disallowances for subsequent periods are not expected to be material 
the company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss  or range of loss  can be reasonably estimated 
any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances 
the company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities  if any  when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates 
for those matters disclosed below  the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is to approximately million based on current exchange rates 
the estimates included in this amount are based on the company s analysis of currently available information and  as new information is obtained  these estimates may change 
due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings  any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the matters in question 
thus  the company s exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower  and possibly significantly so  than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above 
based on current knowledge  management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows 
however  in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above  an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the company s results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year

dollars in millions except per share amounts item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview and outlook colgate palmolive company seeks to deliver strong  consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable 
to this end  the company is tightly focused on two product segments oral  personal and home care  and pet nutrition 
within these segments  the company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories 
these product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long term growth 
operationally  the company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region 
the company competes in more than countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the company s sales and profitability 
approximately of our net sales are generated from markets outside the us  with approximately of our net sales coming from emerging markets which consist of latin america  greater asia africa excluding japan and central europe 
this geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the company s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world 
the oral  personal and home care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments north america  latin america  europe south pacific and greater asia africa  all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors 
the company  through hill s pet nutrition  also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market  selling its products principally through specialty pet retailers and the veterinary profession 
on an ongoing basis  management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance 
these indicators include market share  sales including volume  pricing and foreign exchange components  organic sales growth net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange  acquisitions and divestments  gross profit margin  operating profit  net income and earnings per share  as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital  capital expenditures  cash flow and return on capital 
the monitoring of these indicators  and the company s corporate governance practices including the company s code of conduct  help to maintain business health and strong internal controls 
to achieve its business and financial objectives  the company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth 
the company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories  through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally  which are then rolled out on a global basis 
to enhance these efforts  the company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers  dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers 
growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the company s products 
the investments needed to support this growth are developed through continuous  company wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization through which the company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses  which are referred to as the company s funding the growth initiatives 
the company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses  specifically oral care  personal care and pet nutrition 
on june   the company  colgate palmolive europe s rl  unilever nv and unilever plc together with unilever nv  unilever finalized the company s acquisition from unilever of the sanex personal care business in accordance with a business and share sale and purchase agreement for an aggregate purchase price of  subject to certain post closing purchase price adjustments 
the acquisition was financed with available cash  proceeds from the sale of the company s euro denominated investment portfolio and the issuance of commercial paper 
on july   in connection with the sanex acquisition  colgate sold its laundry detergent business in colombia to unilever for resulting in a pretax gain of aftertax gain 
this gain was more than offset by pretax costs of aftertax costs associated with the implementation of various business realignment and other cost saving initiatives  the sale of land in mexico and a competition law matter in france related to a divested detergent business  as discussed further below 
the various business realignment and other cost saving initiatives include the integration of sanex  the right sizing of the colombia business and the closing of an oral care facility in mississauga  canada and a hill s facility in los angeles  ca 
dollars in millions except per share amounts on september   the company s mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell to the united states of america the mexico city site on which its commercial operations  technology center and soap production facility are located 
the sale price is payable in three installments  with the final installment due upon the transfer of the property  which is expected to occur in the company intends to re invest these payments to relocate its soap production to a new state of the art facility to be constructed at its mission hills  mexico site  to relocate its commercial and technology operations within mexico city and to prepare the existing site for transfer 
as a result  over the next three years  the company expects to make capital improvements and incur costs to exit the site 
these exit costs will primarily be related to staff leaving indemnities  accelerated depreciation and demolition 
as disclosed in item a  risk factors  with over of its net sales generated outside of the united states  the company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates  as well as political uncertainty in some countries  all of which could impact future operating results 
for example  as discussed in detail below  the operating environment in venezuela is challenging  with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations and high inflation and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls  currency exchange controls  price controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources 
in particular  as a result of the devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar fuerte described more fully in note venezuela to the consolidated financial statements  the local currency operations of the company s venezuelan subsidiary cp venezuela now translate into fewer us dollars 
the company has taken  and continues to take  actions to mitigate the impact of both devaluations on its operations  although its ability to do so in the future may be limited due to new price controls instituted by the venezuelan government 
as a result  the company may be unable to implement its pricing strategy to offset the effects of inflation in venezuela 
additionally  the venezuelan government continues to impose import authorization controls and currency exchange and payment controls 
during  a new currency market was established and the government closed the free floating parallel market 
under existing regulations  cp venezuela is not permitted to access the new currency market  but continues to have limited access to us dollars at the official rate  and currently only for imported goods 
as a result  cp venezuela funds its requirements for imported goods through a combination of us dollars obtained from the government at the official rate  intercompany borrowings and existing us dollar cash balances  which were obtained previously through parallel market transactions and through the prior liquidation of its us dollar denominated bond portfolio 
the company s business in venezuela  and the company s ability to repatriate its earnings  continue to be negatively affected by these difficult conditions and would be further negatively affected by additional devaluations or the imposition of additional or more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange  pricing or imports or other governmental actions 
for the year ended december   cp venezuela represented approximately of the company s consolidated net sales 
at december   cp venezuela s local currency monetary net asset position was approximately looking forward  we expect global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging 
while the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive  the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from other large multinational companies  some of which have greater resources than we do 
such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges  as well as increased promotional spending 
additionally  we continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high commodity costs 
while the company has taken  and will continue to take  measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions  should they persist  they could adversely affect the company s future results 
the company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition  experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the company s recently updated strategic initiatives engaging to build our brands  innovation for growth  effectiveness and efficiency  and leading to win 
this focus  together with the strength of the company s global brand names and its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets  should position the company well to increase shareholder value over the long term

managing foreign currency  interest rate and commodity price exposure the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity price fluctuations 
volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques  including working capital management  selling price increases  selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions  issued with standard features  in accordance with the company s treasury and risk management policies 
the company s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose 
the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements 
foreign exchange risk as the company markets its products in over countries and territories  it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost containment measures  selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements 
see the results of operations section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each segment 
the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  other than those operating in highly inflationary environments  are translated into us dollars at year end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders equity 
income and expense items are translated into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments currently  venezuela  inventories  prepaid expenses  goodwill and property  plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates  while other assets and liabilities are remeasured at year end exchange rates 
remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in net income attributable to colgate palmolive company 
the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts  including forward  option and swap contracts  local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases  assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries 
the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates 
dollars in millions except per share amounts the company s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of at december  and net unrealized losses of at december  changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings 
at the end of  an unfavorable change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of interest rate risk the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility 
the notional amount  interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal  interest payment and maturity date of the related debt in all cases  and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates 
based on year end variable rate debt levels  a percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense  net by in commodity price risk the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production  such as resins  tropical oils  essential oils  tallow  corn and soybeans 
the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures  ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts 
futures contracts are used on a limited basis  primarily in the pet nutrition segment  to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities 
the company s open commodity derivative contracts  which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting  resulted in net unrealized losses of and net unrealized gains of for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at the end of  an unfavorable change in commodity futures prices would have increased the net unrealized loss to credit risk the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts  however  nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company s policy to contract with highly rated  diverse counterparties

as permitted under asu no 
 the company has elected to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in two separate consecutive statements beginning in the first quarter of this standard will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates 
the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed 
actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management 
the company s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 
in certain instances  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods 
the company s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories 
shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company reports such costs  primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight  in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
accordingly  the company s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales 
if such costs had been included in cost of sales  gross profit margin as a dollars in millions except per share amounts percent of sales would have decreased by bps  from to in and decreased by bps in and  with no impact on reported earnings 
the company accounts for inventories using both the first in  first out fifo method of inventories and the last in  first out lifo method of inventories 
there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for  and had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo method 
the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits  stock options  asset impairments  uncertain tax positions  tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies 
in pension accounting  the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate for us defined benefit plans was  and as of december   and  respectively 
the discount rate for other us postretirement plans was  and as of december   and  respectively 
discount rates used for the us defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the us plans 
for the company s international plans  the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for us plans was as of december  and as of december  and in determining the long term rate of return  the company considers the nature of the plans investments  an expectation for the plans investment strategies and the historical rate of return 
average annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent year  year  year  year and year periods were     and  respectively 
in addition  the current rate of return assumption for the us plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately in fixed income securities  in equity securities and in real estate and alternative investments 
a change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgate palmolive company by approximately a change in the discount rate for the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgate palmolive company by approximately a third assumption is the long term rate of compensation increase  a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long term rate of return 
this rate was as of december   and refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s pension and other postretirement plans 
the assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate 
the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate 
the assumed rate of increase is for  declining to by and remaining at for the years thereafter 
the effect of a increase in the assumed long term medical cost trend rate would decrease net income attributable to colgate palmolive company by the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  such as stock options and restricted stock  based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant 
the company uses the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards 
the weighted average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended december  was 
the black scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options 
these assumptions include the expected term of options  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield 
while these assumptions do not require significant judgment  as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third party sources  changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value 
a one year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately
