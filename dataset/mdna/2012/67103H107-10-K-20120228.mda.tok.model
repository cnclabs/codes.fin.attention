overview we are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts  tools  supplies  equipment and accessories in the united states 
we are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers  selling our products to both do it yourself diy customers and professional service providers 
our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts  maintenance items  accessories  a complete line of auto body paint and related materials  automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment 
our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer 
for many of our product offerings  this quality differentiation reflects good  better  and best alternatives 
our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the best quality category of products 
consumers willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry 
as of december   we operated  stores in states 
operating within the retail industry  we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including  but not limited to  fuel costs  unemployment rates  consumer preferences and spending habits and competition 
the difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact o reilly and the retail sector in general 
we believe that the average consumer s tendency has been to trade down to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions 
we have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers changing preferences  however  we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of purchasing up on the value spectrum 
we have ongoing initiatives targeted at marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future as the us economy recovers  however  we cannot predict whether  when  or the manner in which  these economic conditions will change 

table of contents we believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of us miles driven  number of us registered vehicles  new light vehicle registrations  average vehicle age and unemployment 
number of miles driven the number of total miles driven in the us heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket 
historically  the long term trend in the total miles driven in the us has steadily increased  however  according to the department of transportation  total miles driven in the us have remained relatively flat since as the us has experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions 
historically  rapid increases in gasoline prices have negatively impacted us total miles driven as consumers react to the increased expense by reducing travel 
average gasoline prices increased in  compared to an increase of in we believe that as the us economy recovers and gasoline prices stabilize  annual miles driven will return to historical growth rates and continue to drive demand for the industry 
number of us registered vehicles  new light vehicle registrations and average vehicle age the total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the us vehicle population also heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket 
as reported by the automotive aftermarket industry association aaia  the total number of registered vehicles has increased over the past decade  from million light vehicles in to million light vehicles in new light vehicle registrations  however  have declined over the past decade  from million registrations in to million registrations in as of december   the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales of total light vehicles in the us was million  indicating that the trend of declining new light vehicle registrations has reversed  however total sales of light vehicles has remained below historical rates for the past three years  contributing to an aging us vehicle population 
as reported by the aaia  the average age of the us vehicle population has increased over the past decade  from years in to years in we believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles  which can be reliably driven at higher miles due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors  depressed new car sales over the past three years at below historical levels  and the consumer s willingness to invest in maintaining their higher mileage  better built vehicles 
as the average age of the vehicle on the road increases  a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of a manufacturer warranty 
these out of warranty  older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles  have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles 
based on this change in consumer sentiment surrounding the length of time older vehicles can be reliably driven at higher mileages  we believe consumers will continue to keep their vehicles even longer as the economy recovers maintaining the trend of an aging vehicle population 
unemployment unemployment rates and continued uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the us have had a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending 
the annual us unemployment rate over the past two years has remained at year highs 
we believe macroeconomic uncertainties and the potential for future joblessness can motivate consumers to find ways to save money  which can be an important factor in the consumer s decision to defer the purchase of a new vehicle and maintain their existing vehicle 
while the deferral of vehicle purchases has led to an increase in vehicle maintenance  long term trends of high unemployment could continue to impede the growth of annual miles driven  as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending  both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket 
we believe that as the economy recovers  unemployment will return to more historic levels and we will see a corresponding increase in commuter traffic as unemployed individuals return to work 
aided by these increased commuter miles  overall annual us miles driven should begin to grow resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products 
key events and recent developments several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below on january   we announced a new board approved share repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to million of shares of our common stock over a three year period 
under the program  we may  from time to time  repurchase shares of our common stock  solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices  based on a variety of factors such as price  corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions 
our board of directors approved resolutions to increase the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional million on august   and an additional million on november   raising the cumulative authorization under the share repurchase program to billion 
the additional million authorizations are effective for three year periods  expiring on august   and november  our board of directors may increase or otherwise modify  renew  suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time  without prior notice 
as of february   we had repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of billion under this program 
on january   we issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due senior notes due in the public market with united missouri bank  na umb as trustee  which were guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries the subsidiary guarantors 
the senior notes due were issued at of their face value and will mature on january  the proceeds from the senior notes due issuance were used to repay all of our outstanding borrowings under our existing secured asset based revolving credit facility 
table of contents the abl credit facility  pay fees and expenses related to the offering and for general corporate purposes 
concurrent with the issuance of the senior notes due  we entered into a year credit agreement for a million unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility arranged by bank of america ba and barclays capital to provide additional financial flexibility 
all remaining debt issuance costs related to our previous abl credit facility  totaling million were written off  and all interest rate swap agreements related to notional amounts under the abl credit facility  with a carrying value of million  were terminated and charged to earnings as one time  non recurring items upon the repayment and retirement of the abl credit facility in january of  which is included in other income expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
on september   we amended our revolving credit facility with ba  which decreased the facility to million and reduced the fees and interest rate margins for borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the amendment also extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to september of in conjunction with the amendment to our revolving credit facility  we recognized a one time charge related to the modification to the credit facility in the amount of million  which is included in other income expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
on september   we issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due senior notes due in the public market with umb as trustee  which were guaranteed by the subsidiary guarantors 
the senior notes due were issued at of their face value and will mature on september  the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes due were used to pay fees and expenses related to the offering  with the remainder for general corporate purposes  including share repurchases

comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery  sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members 

table of contents the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december  in millions increase in sales for the year ended december   compared to the same period in store sales comparable store sales non comparable store sales sales for stores opened throughout  excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales sales in for stores that have closed sales for stores opened throughout non store sales includes sales of machinery  sales to independent parts stores and team member sales total increase in sales we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of high levels of customer service  superior inventory availability  a broader selection of products offered in most stores  a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events  continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores  compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers 
our comparable store sales increase for the year was driven by an increase in average ticket values  partially offset by a decline in customer transaction counts 
the improvement in average ticket values was the result of the continued growth of the higher priced  hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales  and the impact of increased raw material acquisition costs  which were passed through to increased selling prices during the period 
the growth in the hard part categories is driven by the increase of professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and a shift in diy sales to the hard part categories 
during the year  diy customer transaction counts were negatively impacted by the continued pressure on disposable income that our customers faced as a result of increased fuel costs and sustained unemployment levels above historical averages  which offset strong increases in professional service provider transaction counts 
we opened net  new stores during the year ended december   compared to net  new stores for the year ended december  at december   we operated  stores in states compared to  stores in states at december  we anticipate new store unit growth to increase to net  new stores in gross profit gross profit for the year ended december   increased to billion or of sales from billion or of sales for the same period one year ago  representing an increase of 
the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a favorable product mix  improved acquisition costs  improved inventory shrinkage and distribution center efficiencies  partially offset by the impact of increased professional service provider sales as a percentage of the total sales mix 
the improvement in product mix was primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories  which typically generate a high gross profit as a percentage of sales 
increasing hard part sales is the result of strong demand as consumers retain and maintain their vehicles beyond manufacturer warranty periods and our strong growth in sales to professional service providers in the acquired markets 
the improved shrinkage is driven by our converted csk stores  which are now managed using the o reilly point of sale system pos  installed in all csk stores as they converted to the o reilly distribution systems throughout and the o reilly pos provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory  resulting in improved inventory shrinkage 
distribution center efficiencies are the result of leverage on increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced distribution center team members in our newer dcs 
professional service provider sales in the acquired csk markets are growing at a faster rate than total diy sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in those markets  which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy 
professional service provider sales typically carry a lower overall gross profit as a percentage of sales than diy sales  as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service providers  consequently creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended december   increased to billion or of sales from billion or of sales for the same period one year ago  representing an increase of 
the increase in total sg a dollars was primarily the result of additional employees  facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count 
the decrease in sg a as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy and headquarters costs on strong comparable store sales  improved store payroll efficiencies and positive trends related to health benefits  partially offset by increased fuel costs for our store delivery vehicles supporting our growing commercial business 

table of contents operating income operating income for the year ended december   increased to million or of sales from million or of sales for the same period one year ago  representing an increase of 
the increase in operating income during the year was primarily due to the impacts discussed above  as well as million of nonrecurring income in the current year related to a settlement between the securities and exchange commission sec and a former csk officer that resulted in the reimbursement to csk of incentive based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer discussed in detail below see note legal matters to the consolidated financial statements versus a million charge to operating income in the prior year  related to the previously announced legacy csk doj investigation discussed in detail below see note legal matters to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in operating income as a percentage of sales is the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed sg a from strong comparable store sales 
other income and expense total other expense for the year ended december   increased to million or of sales  from million or of sales for the same period one year ago  representing an increase of 
the increase in total other expense for the year was primarily due to one time charges related to our new financing transactions that were completed in january of discussed in detail below  offset by decreased interest expense on a lower average interest rate on outstanding borrowings  a lower facility fee on our revolving credit facility and less amortization of debt issuance costs in the current period as compared to the borrowing rates  facility fee and amortization of debt issuance costs in the prior period 
in addition  during  we recognized a nonrecurring  non operating gain of million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of csk discussed in detail below 
income taxes our provision for income taxes for the year ended december   increased to million effective tax rate from million effective tax rate for the same period one year ago  representing an increase of 
the increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income 
the decrease in the effective rate was primarily the result of the million charge recorded in related to the legacy united states department of justice doj investigation of csk  discussed in detail below  which was not deductible for tax purposes 
net income as a result of the impacts discussed above  net income for the year ended december   increased to million or of sales  from million or of sales for the same period one year ago  representing an increase of 
earnings per share our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december   increased to on million shares from on million shares for the same period one year ago 
the impact of share repurchases during on diluted earnings per share was an increase of approximately 
adjustments for nonrecurring and non operating events our results for the year ended december   included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the sec and a former csk officer that resulted in the reimbursement to o reilly  as successor issuer to csk  of million million  net of tax of incentive based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer 
this clawback amount was included in operating income on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  our results for the year ended december   also included one time charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on january  the one time charges included a non cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous abl credit facility in the amount of million million  net of tax and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of million  net of tax 
the charges related to our new financing transactions were included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  our results for the year ended december   included a nonrecurring  non operating gain in other income expense of million million  net of tax related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the csk acquisition  as well as a charge related to the legacy doj investigation into csk s pre acquisition historical accounting practices 
we accrued million during in anticipation of executing a non prosecution agreement npa among the doj  csk and o reilly and paying a one time monetary penalty of million 
during the third quarter of  the npa was executed and the previously recorded  one time million penalty was paid to the doj on behalf of csk 
the charge related to the legacy csk doj investigation was included in operating income on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  the results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items and are reconciled to the most directly comparable gaap measure in the subsequent table 
adjusted operating income for the year ended december   increased to million or of sales from million or of sales for the same period one year ago

the improvement in comparable store sales for the year was driven both by increased transaction counts and higher average ticket values 
we believe that the increase in transaction counts was a result of the customer s focus on better maintaining their current vehicles  the stabilization of the economy and gas prices during the year and the growth of our commercial business in the acquired csk markets 
the improvement in average ticket value was primarily the result of a larger percentage of our total sales derived from higher priced hard parts categories

the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was the result of improved product mix  lower product acquisition costs and decreased inventory shrinkage at converted csk stores  partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percent of the total sales mix and reduced leverage on the expanded number of distribution centers 
the improvement in product mix was primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories  which typically generate a higher gross margin percentage than other categories 
increasing hard part sales were the result of strong consumer demand as consumers retained their vehicles longer and our enhanced and more comprehensive inventory levels in the hard part categories in the csk stores  supported by a more extensive and robust distribution network 
lower product acquisition costs were derived from improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as the result of large purchase volume increases associated with the acquisition of csk 
the benefit of this improvement in gross margin was realized in the first and second quarters of as compared to the same periods in when we renegotiated these vendor contracts 
our gross margin results for the third and fourth quarters of reflected comparable periods of improved purchasing leverage 
the decrease in inventory shrinkage at converted csk stores was the result of the more robust o reilly point of sale system pos  which was installed in all csk stores when they converted to the o reilly distribution systems 
the o reilly pos provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory resulting in improved inventory shrinkage 
commercial sales are growing at a faster rate than diy sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in our western markets  which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy in these areas 
commercial sales typically carry a lower gross margin percentage than diy sales  as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional customers  and create pressure on our gross margin as a percent of sales 
the reduced leverage on distribution center costs was the result of the additional distribution centers  which were opened in conjunction with the csk integration plan 
new team members in these distribution centers were not yet fully proficient with distribution operations  resulting in inefficiencies

the decrease in sg a as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to increased leverage of fixed costs on very strong comparable store sales levels

liquidity and capital resources our long term business strategy requires capital to open new stores  fund strategic acquisitions  expand distribution infrastructure  operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our board approved share repurchase program 
the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations 
additionally  decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and  therefore  negatively impact the funds available under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short term and long term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels 
liquidity and related ratios the following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of december  and dollars in millions december  december  percentage liquidity and related ratios change current assets quick assets current liabilities working capital total debt total equity current ratio quick ratio debt to equity quick assets include cash  cash equivalents and receivables 
working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities 
current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities

total debt increased and total equity decreased from to the increase in total debt was attributable the issuance of our senior notes during  partially offset by the repayment of our abl credit facility in january of the decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on additional paid in capital and retained earnings  offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year and an increase in additional paid in capital from the proceeds of stock option exercises  and related excess tax benefits  executed under our director and employee share based compensation plans

net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory  
table of contents net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors 
our net inventory investment significantly decreased as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs as well as our ongoing efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems 
our vendor financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our vendors 
our accounts payable to inventory ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
our efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems resulted in a decrease in total inventory of million during the year  despite the fact that we opened new stores during the year 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for the effect of non cash depreciation and amortization charges and deferred income taxes  a significant decrease in net inventory investment and an increase in other liabilities as compared to the same period in the decrease in net inventory investment in as compared to was the result of the significant investments in to improve the inventory availability in the acquired csk stores 
the increase in other liabilities was principally due to the accrual of the csk doj investigation charge during  which was paid in investing activities the decrease in cash used in investing activities in compared to is primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures 
total capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in during  we completed the comprehensive expansion of our distribution system in the csk markets and the conversion of the csk stores to the o reilly pos  resulting in reduced levels of conversion related capital expenditures during the decrease in cash used in investing activities in compared to was principally due to a decrease in capital expenditures associated with the integration of csk and an increase in payments received on notes receivable 
capital expenditures related to the acquisition of csk included the purchase of properties for distribution centers dc s and costs associated with the conversion of csk stores to the o reilly brand 
although we opened four new dcs in  a significant portion of the capital expenditures for these dcs occurred in as we acquired property and began construction of the facilities 
the increase in payments received on notes receivable was due to the one time nonrecurring payment received to settle a note receivable acquired in the csk acquisition 
we opened net  new stores in  net  new stores in and net  new stores in we plan to open net  new stores in the costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition  improvements  fixtures  vehicles  net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately million to million  however  such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease  rather than purchase  the store site 
financing activities the increase in net cash used in financing activities during compared to is primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during in accordance with our board approved share repurchase program  which was partially offset by an increase in net long term borrowings in as compared to net repayments under our facilities during the net borrowings in are the result of proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes due and our senior notes due in january and september of  respectively  partially offset by the repayment and termination of our previous abl credit facility and the payment of debt issuance costs related to the issuance of our senior notes and the establishment of our new unsecured revolving credit facility 
the net repayments under our facilities in were the result of our focus on using available cash on hand to reduce the level of outstanding borrowings under our secured abl credit facility 
net cash used in financing activities in compared to net cash provided by financing activities in is driven by the increase in net repayments of outstanding borrowings on our long term debt 
credit facilities on july   we entered into a credit agreement for a five year asset based revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to mature in july of at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under the abl credit facility  of which million were not covered under an interest rate swap contract 
all outstanding borrowings under the abl credit facility were repaid  and all related interest rate swap transaction contracts were terminated on january   and the abl credit facility was retired concurrent with the issuance of our senior notes due  as further described below 
in conjunction with the retirement of our abl credit facility  we recognized a one time non cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to the abl credit facility in the amount of million and a one time charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap contracts in the amount of million  which are included in other income expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  on january   we entered into a new credit agreement for a five year million unsecured revolving credit facility arranged by ba and barclays capital  which was scheduled to mature in january of during  we amended the unsecured revolving credit facility  which decreased the facility to million and reduced the fees and interest rate margins for borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the amendment also extended the maturity of the revolving credit facility to september of in conjunction with the amendment to the revolving credit facility  we recognized a one time charge related to the modification to the credit facility in the amount of million  which is included in other income expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  the revolving credit facility includes a million sub limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a million sub limit for swing line borrowings 
as described in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility  we may  from time to time subject to certain conditions  increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to million 
as of december   we had stand by letters of credit  primarily to satisfy workers compensation  general liability and other insurance policies  in the amount of million 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

table of contents senior notes senior notes due on january   we issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due senior notes due at a price to the public of of their face value with united missouri bank  na umb as trustee 
interest on the senior notes due is payable on january and july of each year  which began on july   and is computed on the basis of a day year 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes due were used to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under our abl credit facility and to pay fees and expenses related to the offering and costs associated with terminating our existing interest rate swap contracts  with the remainder used for general corporate purposes 
senior notes due on september   we issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due senior notes due at a price to the public of of their face value with umb as trustee 
interest on the senior notes due is payable on march and september of each year beginning on march   and is computed on the basis of a day year 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes due were used to pay fees and expenses related to the offering  with the remainder intended to be used to repay borrowings outstanding from time to time under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes  including share repurchases 
the senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries subsidiary guarantors that incurs or guarantees our obligations under our revolving credit facility or certain of our other debt or any of our subsidiary guarantors 
the guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several 
each of the subsidiary guarantors is wholly owned  directly or indirectly  by us and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries 
our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be subsidiary guarantors would be minor subsidiaries 
no minor subsidiaries exist today 
neither we  nor any of our subsidiary guarantors  are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries  except as provided by applicable law 
each of our senior notes is subject to certain customary covenants  with which we complied as of december  debt covenants the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to  among other things i create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt  ii enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions  and iii merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property  in each case as set forth in the indentures 
these covenants are  however  subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions 
the credit agreement contains covenants  including limitations on total outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility  a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of times through december   times through december   times through maturity  and a maximum adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of times through maturity 
the consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  rent and stock option compensation expense ebitdar to adjusted debt 
adjusted debt includes outstanding debt  outstanding stand by letters of credit  six times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long term debt 
in the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the credit agreement  certain actions may be taken against us  including but not limited to possible termination of credit extensions  immediate payment of outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest and litigation from our lenders 
we had a fixed charge coverage ratio of times and times as of december  and  respectively  and an adjusted debt to adjusted ebitdar ratio of times and times as of december  and  respectively  remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements 
under our current financing policy  we have targeted an adjusted consolidated leverage ratio range of times to times

we do not  nor do we suggest investors should  consider such non gaap financial measures in isolation from  or as a substitute for  gaap financial information 
we believe that the presentation of our fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted ebitdar provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement 
we include these items in judging our performance and believe this non gaap information is useful to investors as well 
material limitations of these non gaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts 
we compensate for such limitations by presenting  in the table above  the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements are transactions  agreements  or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
we have utilized various off balance sheet financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a cost effective alternative to our existing sources of cash 
we do not believe  however  that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans 
on december   we entered into a sale leaseback transaction with an unrelated party 
under the terms of the transaction  we sold properties  including land  buildings and improvements  which generated million of cash 
the lease  which is being accounted for as an operating lease  provides for an initial lease term of years and may be extended for one initial ten year period and two additional successive periods of five years each 
the resulting gain of million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term 
net rent expense during the initial term is approximately million annually 
in august  we entered into a sale leaseback with o reilly wooten  llp an entity owned by certain of our affiliates 
the transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine o reilly auto parts stores and generated approximately million of cash 
the transaction did not result in a material gain or loss 
the lease  which has been accounted for as an operating lease  calls for an initial term of years with three five year renewal options 
we issue stand by letters of credit provided by a million sub limit under the revolving credit facility that reduce our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation  general liability and other insurance policies 
substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one year term from the date of issuance 
letters of credit totaling million and million were outstanding at december  and  respectively 

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december   included commitments for short and long term debt arrangements  interest payments related to long term debt  future payments under non cancelable lease arrangements  self insurance reserves and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments  which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in note long term debt and note commitments to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
deferred income taxes and commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory are included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets but are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities  the nature of the account or the commitment s cancellation terms 
due to the absence of scheduled maturities  the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined  except for amounts estimated to be payable in  which are included in current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
payments due by period total before year to years to years years and over in thousands contractual obligations long term debt principal and interest payments future minimum lease payments under capital leases future minimum lease payments under operating leases other obligations self insurance reserves construction commitments total contractual cash obligations on january   we entered into a new credit agreement for a five year million revolving credit facility  which matures in january of on september   we amended the credit agreement  decreasing the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility to million  extending the maturity date on the credit agreement to september of and reducing the facility fee and interest rate margins for borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility other than swing line loans bear interest  at our option  at either the base rate or eurodollar rate both as defined in the agreement plus a margin  that will vary from to in the case of loans bearing interest at the eurodollar rate and to in the case of loans bearing interest at the base rate  in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by moody s investor service  inc and standard poor s rating services 
swing line loans made under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the base rate plus the applicable margin described above 
in addition  we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments  varying from to based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by moody s investor service  inc and standard poor s rating services 
based on our current credit ratings  our margin for base rate loans is  our margin for eurodollar rate loans is and our facility fee is the minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax  insurance and maintenance costs  which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year 
these expenses historically average approximately of the corresponding lease payments 
we use various self insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation  vehicle and general liability  and employee health care benefits 
these liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities  however we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns 
we record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions  including estimated interest and penalties  which are fully disclosed in note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined 
as of december   we recorded a liability of million related to these uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheets  all of which was included as a component of other liabilities 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management 
management bases its assumptions  estimates  and adjustments on historical experience  current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates 
management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap 
however  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

table of contents inventory obsolescence and shrink inventory  which consists of automotive hard parts  maintenance items  accessories and tools  is stated at the lower of cost or market 
the extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal 
the products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population 
we have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and  accordingly  have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand 
we do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost 
this reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate  at a given point in time  the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods 
ultimately  our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances 
we have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future 
we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink 
we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic  full physical inventories at our stores and dcs 
to the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage  we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances 
we have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates 
if unrecorded shrink changed from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  accounts receivable we provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors 
actual results have consistently been within management s expectations  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  if actual results differ from our estimates  we may be exposed to losses or gains 
if the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed from our estimated allowance at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
as part of the evaluation  we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment 
a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets 
actual results could differ from these estimates  which could materially impact our impairment assessment 
we review goodwill for impairment annually on november  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
we have not historically recorded an impairment to goodwill 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company using the market approach 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value 
in the future  if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired  we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs  however  we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of december   nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing 
if the price of o reilly stock  which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing  changed by from the value used during testing  the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required 
vendor concessions we receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including co operative advertising  allowances for warranties  merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates 
co operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program  specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes  are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred 
all other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory 
amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns 
management regularly reviews amounts receivable from 
table of contents vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations 
based on our historical results and current assessment  we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations 
the eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
self insurance reserves we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability  property loss  and team member health care benefits 
with the exception of certain team member health care benefit liabilities  we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability or property loss claim 
when estimating our self insurance liabilities  we consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience and trend lines  projected medical and legal inflation  and growth patterns and exposure forecasts 
the assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations 
our calculation of self insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities 
actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates  which may result in material losses or gains 
as we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods  we adjust our self insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information 
these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value 
these liabilities do not have scheduled maturities  but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns 
we could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities 
if self insurance reserves were changed from our estimated reserves at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  closed property reserves we maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations 
we accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non cancelable lease payments  contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date  net of estimated sublease income 
the closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms 
we estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located  our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions 
adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known 
if closed property reserves were changed from our estimated reserves at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  legal reserves we maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which o reilly is currently involved 
we are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business as well as resolving the governmental investigations and litigation that are being conducted against certain of csk s former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the acquisition date 
as a result of the acquisition  we expect to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to such investigations  litigation and indemnity obligations 
our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of csk 
management  with the assistance of outside legal counsel  must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures 
if legal reserves were changed from our estimated reserves at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  taxes we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit 
the amount of such liabilities is based on various factors  such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority  experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings 
changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and or changes in tax regulations 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented 
the estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates 
alternatively  we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position 
while our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion  our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority 

table of contents inflation and seasonality for the last three fiscal years  we have been successful  in many cases  in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs  economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying 
to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry wide  we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products 
as a result  we do not believe our operations have been materially  adversely affected by inflation 
to some extent  our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns 
while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year  our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 
quarterly results the following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal and the unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown

asu amends subtopic  requiring additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements such as transfers in and out of levels and  as well as separate disclosures about activity relating to level measurements 
asu clarifies existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation and input valuation techniques 
the updated guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   with the exception of the new level activity disclosures  which were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the application of this guidance affected disclosures only and therefore  did not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu was issued to bring the definition of fair value  the guidance for fair value measurement and the disclosure requirements under us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs in line with one another 
asu also enhanced the disclosure requirements for changes and transfers within the valuation hierarchy levels  particularly valuations in level fair value measurements  and was effective for periods beginning after december  the application of this guidance affects disclosures only and therefore  should not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in june of  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income 
asu was issued to improve the comparability of financial reporting between us gaap and ifrs  and eliminates previous us gaap guidance that allowed an entity to present components of other comprehensive income oci as part of its statement of changes in shareholders equity 
with the issuance of asu  companies are now required to report all components of oci either in a single continuous statement of total comprehensive income  which includes components of both oci and net income  or in a separate statement appearing consecutively with the statement of income 
asu does not affect current guidance for the accounting of the components of oci  or which items are included within total comprehensive income 
in december of  the fasb issued asu no 
deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 

asu defers changes in asu that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments shown on the face of the financial statements 
no other requirements of asu were affected by the issuance of asu  including the requirement to report income either in a single continuous financial statement or in a separate statement of total comprehensive income  which is effective for periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted this guidance with our financial statements  the application of this guidance affects presentation only and therefore  did not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in september of  the fasb issued asu no 
testing goodwill for impairment 
asu was issued to simplify the impairment test of goodwill  by allowing entities to use a qualitative approach to determine whether goodwill impairment might exist  before completing the entire impairment test 
under asu  an entity has the option to first assess any qualitative factors that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the changes under asu are effective for public companies for annual and interim testing performed for periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the application of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with variable interest rates based on either a base rate or eurodollar rate  as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility 
historically  we had entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risks associated with borrowings against our previous credit facility with variable interest rates  however  as of december   we did not have any interest rate swap contracts and had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we invest certain of our excess cash balances in short term  highly liquid instruments with maturities of days or less 
we do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million
