table of contents the company derives substantially all of its revenue from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of the operating properties 
because the company believes that critical load is the primary factor used by tenants in evaluating data center requirements  rents are based primarily on the amount of power that is made available to tenants  rather than the amount of space that they occupy 
in  the company executed leases and pre leases representing mw of critical load and  raised square feet of space with an average lease term of years 
in the third quarter of  the company also renewed for an additional eight years a lease for mw of critical load and  raised square feet which now expires in mw increments in through each of the company s leases includes pass through provisions under which tenants are required to pay for their pro rata share of most of the property level operating expenses  such as real estate taxes and insurance commonly referred to as a triple net lease 
in addition  under the company s triple net lease structure  tenants pay for only the power they use and power that is used to cool their space 
the company intends to continue to structure future leases as triple net leases 
the company s leases also provide it with a property management fee based on a percentage of base rent collected and property level operating expenses  other than charges for power used by tenants to run their servers and cool their space 
also  most of the company s leases provide for annual rent increases  generally at a rate of or a function of the consumer price index 
the company leases space on a long term basis  and the company s weighted average remaining lease term was approximately years as of december  although less than of the company s leases in terms of annualized base rent are scheduled to expire through  the company s ability to generate rental income over time will depend on its ability to retain tenants when their leases expire and re lease space available from leases that expire or are terminated at attractive rates 
changes in the conditions of any of the markets in which the company s operating properties are located will impact the overall performance of the company s current and future operating properties and the company s ability to fully lease its properties 
the ability of the company s tenants to fulfill their lease commitments could be impacted by future economic or regional downturns in the markets in which the company operates or downturns in the technology industry 
the opportunity for revenue growth in the near term primarily depends on the company s ability to lease vacant space in four of its operating properties that were recently placed into service acc phase i  nj phase i  sc phase i and ch phase ii 
in each of its stabilized properties  the company has been able to lease vacant space at rates that provide a favorable return on its investment in these facilities 
recently  there appears to be increased pricing pressure in some of the markets in which we compete  including lower rates and concessions 
it is unclear to what extent this will adversely impact the rental rates that the company can obtain as it pursues leasing available space at the four properties we recently placed into service 
the returns on the company s investments it has achieved to date would be impacted negatively if it is unable to lease vacant space at net effective rental rates equal to or above its current average net effective rental rates 
the company receives expense reimbursement from tenants only on space that is leased 
vacant space results in portions of the company s operating expenses being unreimbursed  which in turn negatively impacts revenues and net income 
it is difficult for the company to predict the timing for signing and commencing leases for available space 
this uncertainty is particularly true with respect to the leasing of vacant space in data center facilities that are located in new markets for the company nj phase i in piscataway  new jersey and sc phase i in santa clara  california 
our three largest tenants comprised of our annualized base rent as of december   and none of our three largest tenants leases have early termination rights 
the company expects these tenants to evaluate their lease expirations in the year before expiration is scheduled to occur  taking into account  among other factors  their anticipated need for server capacity and economic factors 
if the company cannot renew these leases at similar rates or attract replacement tenants on similar terms in a timely manner  the company s rental income could be materially adversely impacted in future periods 

table of contents the company s second largest tenant  yahoo  comprising of the company s annualized base rent as of december   with lease expirations ranging from to  informed the company in june that it will not renew one of its leases comprising of the company s consolidated annualized base rent as of december  this lease will expire on april  and the company is actively marketing this space 
this tenant s next lease is scheduled to expire in the third quarter of and a third lease is scheduled to expire ratably in equal amounts in  and the company s taxable reit subsidiary trs  df technical services  llc  generates revenue by providing certain technical services to the company s tenants on a non recurring contract or purchase order basis  which the company refers to as a la carte services 
such services include the installation of circuits  racks  breakers and other tenant requested items 
the trs will generally charge tenants for these services on a cost plus basis 
because the degree of utilization of the trs for these services varies from period to period depending on the needs of the tenants for technical services  the company has limited ability to forecast future revenue from this source 
moreover  as a taxable corporation  the trs is subject to federal  state and local corporate taxes and is not required to distribute its income  if any  to the company for purposes of making additional distributions to dft s stockholders 
because demand for its services is unpredictable  the company anticipates that the trs may retain a significant amount of its cash to fund future operations  and therefore the company does not expect to receive distributions from the trs on a regular basis 
in the current economic environment  certain types of real estate have experienced declines in value 
if this trend were to be experienced by any of the company s data centers  the company may have to write down the value of that data center  which would result in the company recording a charge against earnings 
results of operations this annual report on form k contains stand alone audited and unaudited financial statements and other financial data for each of dft and the operating partnership 
dft is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and  as of december   owned of the common economic interests in the operating partnership  of which approximately is held as general partnership units

also offsetting the increase in revenue is a million reduction in due to energy costs savings from the company s participation in load management and rate setting programs 
these energy savings  while a reduction of revenue to the company  represent a direct reduction of property operating costs as well  due to the triple net lease structure in place with tenants

on december   we completed a million debt offering and repaid and terminated a credit facility  as discussed further below 
in addition  the company paid million to terminate the related interest rate swap agreement 
in connection with the termination of the credit facility and swap agreement  the company determined that the forecasted transaction under this swap agreement was no longer probable as originally forecasted and therefore all amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss were recognized in the statement of operations  resulting in million being recorded as loss on the discontinuance of cash flow hedge 
we did not incur any such loss in net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests operating partnership dft only 
net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests operating partnership for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was due to lower net income and a lower allocation of net income to redeemable noncontrolling interests due to the redemption of million op units in net income attributable to common shares

development related expenditures were million for the year ended december  which is an increase by million year over year 
also  interest capitalized for real estate under development increased by million year over year to million for the year ended december  the company expects development related expenditures and capitalized interest to decrease significantly in as the company does not currently have any developments in process since ch phase ii was placed in service on february  the company also acquired acres of land held for future development at a cost of million during expenditures for improvements to real estate were million in the year ended december  which compared to million in in addition during the year ended december   the company redeemed million in marketable securities held to maturity and purchased million of these securities

this development not only requires the company to make substantial capital investments  but also increases its operating expenses  which impacts its cash flows from operations negatively until leases are executed and the company begins to collect cash rents from these leases 
in addition  because dft has elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes  dft is required to distribute at least of reit taxable income  excluding any net capital gain  to its stockholders annually 
the company generally funds the cost of data center development from additional capital  which  for future developments  the company would expect to obtain through unsecured and secured borrowings  construction financings and the issuance of additional preferred and or common equity  when market conditions permit 
in determining the source of capital to meet the company s long term liquidity needs  the company will evaluate its level of indebtedness and covenants  in particular with respect to the covenants under the company s unsecured notes and unsecured line of credit  its expected cash flow from operations  the state of the capital markets  interest rates and other terms for borrowing  and the relative timing considerations and costs of borrowing or issuing equity securities

the company used the net proceeds from this offering  together with borrowings under its revolving credit facility  to complete the development of ch phase ii  which was placed in service on february  the ability to pay dividends to stockholders is dependent on the receipt of distributions from the operating partnership  which in turn is dependent on the data center properties generating operating income

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as december   the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the company has provided a summary of its significant accounting policies in note to its financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company s actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company describes below those accounting policies that it deems critical and requires material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on its financial condition and results of operations 
the company s management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date hereof 
revenue recognition 
rental income is recognized using the straight line method over the terms of the tenant leases  which commences when control of the space and the critical power have been provided to the tenant 
deferred rent included in the company s consolidated balance sheets represents the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual rental payments that will be recognized under the remaining terms of the leases 
the company s leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse it for a portion of property operating expenses it incurs 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
the company recognizes amortization of the value of acquired above market tenant leases as a reduction of rental revenue and of below market leases as an increase to rental revenue 
the company must make subjective estimates as to when its revenue is earned  including a determination of the lease commencement date for accounting purposes  the existence of lease inducements and early termination clauses with penalty payments and the collectability of its accounts receivable related to rent  deferred rent  expense reimbursements and other income 
the company analyzes individual accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
these estimates have a direct impact on net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income  and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net income for a particular period 
capitalization of costs 
the company capitalizes direct and indirect costs related to construction and development  including property taxes  insurance and financing costs relating to properties under development 
in addition  the company ceases cost capitalization after a development is placed in service and a certificate of occupancy is obtained  or if a project is temporarily suspended 
the company capitalizes pre acquisition costs related to probable property acquisitions 
the selection of costs to capitalize and the determination of whether a proposed acquisition is probable are subjective and depends on many assumptions including the timing of potential acquisitions and the probability that future acquisitions occur 
variations in these assumptions would yield different amounts of capitalized costs in the periods presented 
all capital improvements for the income producing properties that extend the property s useful life are capitalized 
for the year ended december   the company capitalized million of internal development and leasing costs on all of its data centers 

table of contents useful lives of assets 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the major components of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to its investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
the following presents the major components of the company s properties and the useful lives over which they are depreciated 
component average of total component life years land n a building improvements electrical structure power distribution units electrical structure uninterrupted power supply electrical structure switchgear transformers fire protection security systems mechanical structure heating  ventilating and air conditioning mechanical structure chiller pumps building automation mechanical structure chilled water storage and pipes total weighted average life the company regularly performs preventive maintenance on its data center components to ensure continual operation and avoid downtime at its data centers 
these maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and included as property operating costs in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the company s triple net leases provide for the reimbursement of the tenant s share of these costs and the reimbursements are included as recoveries from tenants on the company s consolidated statement of operations 
asset impairment evaluation 
the company reviews the carrying value of its net real estate on a quarterly and annual basis 
the company bases its review on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
the company considers factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if the company s evaluation indicates that it may be unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property  which would result in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since cash flows from properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  the company s strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if this strategy changes or market conditions dictate an earlier sale date or if the company determines that development of a project is no longer viable  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if the company determines that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
the company estimates the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues  expenses and capital improvement costs  similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers 

table of contents funds from operations year ended december  net income depreciation and amortization less non real estate depreciation and amortization ffo funds from operations  or ffo  is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure for reits 
the company calculates ffo in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income determined in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap  impairment charges on depreciable real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus specified non cash items  such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company also presents ffo attributable to common shares and op units  which is ffo excluding preferred stock dividends 
ffo attributable to common shares and op units per share is calculated on a basis consistent with net income attributable to common shares and op units and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred stock dividends 
the company uses ffo as a supplemental performance measure because  in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions  it provides a performance measure that  when compared period over period  captures trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating expenses 
the company also believes that  as a widely recognized measure of the performance of equity reits  ffo may be used by investors as a basis to compare the company s operating performance with that of other reits 
however  because ffo excludes real estate related depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the company s properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company s properties  all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact the company s results from operations  the utility of ffo as a measure of the company s performance is limited 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of equity reits  other equity reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffo and  accordingly  ffo as disclosed by such other reits may not be comparable to the company s ffo 
therefore  the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of its historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of operations 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or to cash flow from operating activities each as computed in accordance with gaap or as an indicator of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to meet the company s cash needs  including its ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
related party transactions land purchase in june  the company purchased an undeveloped parcel of land from an entity controlled by its chairman of the board and president and ceo for million 
the chairman and the president and ceo owned a and interest in this entity  respectively 
one of dft s independent directors is a non managing member of the entity and has a interest in this entity 
the location of the parcel  which consists of approximately acres  is adjacent to the company s acc data center campus in ashburn  virginia and is being held for development of a megawatt data center known as acc the purchase process was managed by the company s audit committee  excluding the interested director  and the purchase price was based on appraisals prepared by independent appraisal firms and unanimously approved by the disinterested members of the audit committee 

table of contents leasing arrangements as of december   the company leased approximately  square feet of office space in washington  dc  an office building owned by entities affiliated with dft s chairman of the board and president and chief executive officer 
this lease expires in september the company believes that the terms of this lease are fair and reasonable and reflect the terms it could expect to obtain in an arm s length transaction for comparable space elsewhere in washington  dc rent expense under this lease was million for the year ended december  aircraft charter from time to time during  the company chartered an aircraft owned by its president and ceo  at rates that the company believes are fair and reasonable and reflect the terms that it would expect to obtain in an arm s length transaction for use of a comparable aircraft 
for the year ended december   the company incurred a total of million of expense under charters of this aircraft for business related travel of the company 
for the year ended december   the company incurred a total of million of expenses for personal travel by the president and ceo paid for by the company in lieu of the ceo s annual salary under the terms of his employment agreement 
subsequent events in january  dft issued an additional million shares  or million  of its series b preferred stock in an underwritten public offering that resulted in proceeds to the company  net of underwriting discounts  commissions  advisory fees and other offering costs  of million 
the company used a portion of the proceeds from this offering to pay off the outstanding balance of its unsecured credit facility and plans to use the remainder for general corporate purposes 
for each share of series b preferred stock issued by dft  the operating partnership issued a preferred unit equivalent to dft with the same terms 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s variable rate debt consists of the acc term loan and the unsecured credit facility 
the acc term loan bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin and the unsecured credit facility bears interest at a rate equal to libor or a base rate which is either a prime rate or a federal funds rate plus an applicable margin 
if interest rates were to increase by  the increase in interest expense on the company s variable rate debt outstanding as of december  would decrease future net income and cash flows by million annually less the impact of capitalization of interest incurred on the company s net income 
because one month libor was approximately at december   a decrease of would increase future net income and cash flows by million annually less the impact of capitalization of interest incurred on the company s net income 
interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s financial instruments 
these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  the company may take specific actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in the company s financial structure 
the company believes that it has effectively managed interest rate exposure because the majority of its indebtedness bears a fixed rate of interest 
at december   of the company s indebtedness was fixed rate debt 
the company also utilizes preferred stock to raise capital  the dividends required under the terms of which have a coupon rate that is fixed 
pursuant to the acc term loan agreement  the operating partnership is required to enter into an interest rate protection agreement upon the earlier to occur of i days following the date on which us dollar one month libor equals or exceeds or ii the occurrence of a default under the acc term loan
