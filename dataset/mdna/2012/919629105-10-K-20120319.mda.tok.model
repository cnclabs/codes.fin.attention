item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company as of and for the years ended december  and the purpose of this discussion is to focus on important factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes to assist in the evaluation of our performance 
executive overview valley financial corporation  a virginia corporation  is a financial holding company based in roanoke  virginia

the company s largest core lending business is its commercial real estate loan operation  which offers fixed and variable rate loans and lines of credit secured by real estate properties 
these loans are generally made on local properties or to local customers within our market 
while the company s rebound in from the unprecedented real estate downturn and resulting severe recession of and marked the beginning of our resurgence as a high performing community banking company  s performance was exceptional by all standards of measurement and comparison 
an improving credit quality  strong balance sheet management and superior expense control were the hallmarks of another record year of earnings performance for our company in as noted below  the earned per fully diluted share marked a momentous threshold achievement in the company s year history 
for the year ended december   the company reported net income of million compared to million for last year  an increase of million  or 
after the dividend on preferred stock and accretion of discounts on warrants  net income available to common shareholders was million  or per diluted common share  as compared to million  or per diluted common share  for the last year  an increase of 
the company s earnings for the year produced an annualized return on average total assets of and an annualized return on average shareholder s equity of  compared to and respectively for the book value of the company s common stock increased to per share as of december   up over the per share book value as of a year earlier 
at december   valley financial s total assets were million  total deposits were million  total loans stood at million and total shareholders equity was million 
compared with december   the company experienced increases of million or in total assets  million or in total deposits and million or in total equity  while total loans decreased million or over the twelve month period 
average loans for the year were million  down from the average of million during  while average securities were million  up million or as compared to the prior year 
average deposits were million  up million or as compared to the million for the company s risk based capital levels improved as well  and remain well above regulatory standards for well capitalized banks 
tier risk based and total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively  at december   improved from the and reported at september   and improved from the and reported at december  the company s leverage ratio also improved to at december  from the and reported at september  and december  respectively 
the company is current on all preferred dividend payments to the us treasury and current on all interest payments on the company s trust preferred securities 

table of contents as you may recall  witnessed our ascension to the market share position in deposits for the greater roanoke metropolitan statistical area and in  our hold on that position strengthened according to the june  fdic summary of deposits report 
the company s market share in increased to from in and we now trail just wells fargo  suntrust  and bb t in terms of market share 
as we did in  this deposit growth continues to be fueled by core  transaction based accounts and our innovative and exciting suite of products such as mylifestyle checking and savings and our prime money market have lead the way 
as of the end of  prime money market deposits totaled million  up million over  and this is on top of the million  or increase over year end in addition  we are quite pleased with our continued success in attracting noninterest bearing deposits which increased in compared to year end all of this core deposit growth has greatly reduced the need to chase higher cost certificates of deposit 
we attribute this phenomenal deposit growth to great products  delivered by our experienced and talented bankers with an exceptional level of service offered to our customers 
as we anticipated  this significant growth in core deposits had a very positive effect on our overall cost of funds in the company s cost of funds was for the year ended december   compared to reported for the prior year 
this improvement was the primary driver that resulted in an increase in net interest income of million or  as compared to the prior year and an increase in the company s net interest margin of basis points to 
improving credit quality remains the primary focus of senior management and we are pleased to report that during we successfully resolved several problem loan situations that resulted in a reduction in the level of reserves required 
the company s ratio of non performing assets as a percentage of total assets decreased basis points to as of december   as compared to as of december   and has declined a total of basis points from the reported as of december  loan loss provisions decreased substantially in comparison to the prior year period  from million in to just  in at december   the ratio of allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was compared to as of december  we remain  however  cautiously optimistic that asset quality will continue to improve and that our potential to achieve improved profitability will continue to be enhanced 
our plan for continues to incorporate growing our capital base at a pace exceeding the rate of asset growth in order to position the company to begin repayment of the preferred stock associated with the us treasury departments capital purchase program from retained earnings 
just recently  we were one of the first and loudest voices in addressing the stipulated level of incremental redemption of the tarp preferred shares 
as we requested  the us treasury did amend the level for incremental redemption from of the amount outstanding to  with a minimum of  this amendment should enable community banking companies to be better positioned to receive the required regulatory support to commence redeeming the preferred shares 
as we look forward to the continued growth and success of our company  we must continue to focus on the four key constituencies we have identified as the keys to achieving our goals and objectives  those being our shareholders our employees our customers our community we remain committed to attracting and retaining employees who possess an unparalleled desire to achieve  who thrive in a banking environment that provides new challenges and opportunities  and who seek to take this institution to new heights 
our ability to continue to build strong and enduring relationships with our customers coupled with an ability to provide a unique customer experience will be  in our opinion  the differentiating factors 
if we continue to be successful in these two key areas  we feel confident we can also deliver superior returns for our shareholders 
non usgaap financial measures the company measures the net interest margin as an indicator of profitability 
the net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets 
because a portion of interest income earned by the company is nontaxable  the tax equivalent net interest income is considered in the calculation of this ratio 
tax equivalent net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit realized from interest income that is nontaxable to 
table of contents total interest income then subtracting total interest expense 
the tax rate utilized in calculating the tax benefit for and is 
the reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income  which is not a measurement under gaap  to net interest income  is reflected in the table below 
in thousands net interest income  non tax equivalent less tax exempt interest income add tax equivalent of tax exempt interest income net interest income  tax equivalent critical accounting estimates general the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states usgaap and with general practices within the banking industry 
in connection with the application of those principles  we have made judgments and estimates  which in the case of the determination of our allowance for loan losses  deferred tax assets  and foreclosed assets have been critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations 
management considers accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the company considers the allowance for loan and lease losses of million appropriate to cover losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio as of december  however  no assurance can be given that the company will not in any particular period  sustain loan and lease losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio  in light of factors then prevailing  including economic conditions  the company s ongoing credit review process or regulatory requirements  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
among other factors  a continued economic slowdown and or a decline in commercial or residential real estate values in the company s market may have an adverse impact on the current adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses by increasing credit risk and the risk of potential loss 
the total allowance for loan and lease losses is generally available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
the allocation of the company s allowance for loan and lease losses disclosed in the asset quality table is subject to change based on the changes in criteria used to evaluate the allowance and is not necessarily indicative of the trend or future losses in any particular portfolio 
the discussion and analysis included in this section contains detailed information regarding the company s allowance for loan and lease losses  net charge offs  non performing assets  past due loans and leases and potential problem loans and leases 
included in this data are numerous portfolio ratios that must be carefully reviewed in relation to the nature of the underlying loan and lease portfolios before appropriate conclusions can be reached regarding the company or for purposes of making comparisons to other banks 
most of the company s non performing assets and past due loans are secured by real estate 
given the nature of these assets and the related mortgage foreclosure and property sale  it can take months or longer for a loan to migrate from initial delinquency to final disposition 
this resolution process generally takes much longer for loans secured by real estate than for unsecured loans or loans secured by other property primarily due to state real estate foreclosure laws 
deferred taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement 
table of contents carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance may be established 
management considers the determination of this valuation allowance to be a critical accounting policy due to the need to exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets  including projections of future taxable income 
these judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required if the amounts of taxes recoverable through loss carry backs decline  or if we project lower levels of future taxable income 
if such a valuation allowance is deemed necessary in the future  it would be established through a charge to income tax expense that would adversely affect our operating results 
foreclosed assets foreclosed assets represent properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession 
appraisals are obtained at the time of foreclosure and any necessary write downs to fair value at the time of transfer to foreclosed assets are charged to allowance for loan losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  we periodically evaluate the value of foreclosed assets held for sale and record an impairment charge for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs 
subsequent declines in value are charged to operations 
fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors  including our historical loss experience  economic conditions  and issues specific to individual properties 
our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change 
results of operations net income compared to for the year ended december   the company reported net income of million compared to million for last year  an increase of million or 
after the dividend on preferred stock and accretion of discounts on warrants  net income available to common shareholders was million  or per diluted common share  as compared to million  or per diluted common share  for the last year 
the company s earnings for the year produced an annualized return on average total assets of and an annualized return on average shareholder s equity of in comparison to and for the book value of the company s common stock increased to per share as of december   up over the per share book value as of a year earlier 
loan loss provisions decreased substantially in comparison to the prior year  from million in to  in we believe our total reserve is adequate and appropriate to cover our potential loss exposure on impaired loans based upon a full collateral analysis of each impaired relationship identified and to cover any other probable losses on our remaining portfolio 
net income for the three month period ending december  was million compared to net income of  for the same period last year 
after deducting the dividends and discount accretion on preferred stock  net income available to common shareholders for the three month period ended december  amounted to million compared to  for the same period last year

calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis fte 
compared to we recorded net income of million for the year ended december   an increase of million over the million net loss reported for the same period in after deducting the dividends and discount accretion on preferred stock  net income available to common shareholders for the year ending december  amounted to million compared to a net loss to common shareholders of million for the year ending december  loan loss provisions of million were recorded in  a decrease of million from the million in loan loss provisions for the same month period in net income for the three months ended december  was  compared to net loss of million reported for the fourth quarter of net interest income the primary source of the company s banking revenue is net interest income  which represents the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets 
earning assets include loans  securities  and federal funds sold 
interest bearing liabilities include deposits and borrowings 
to compare the tax exempt yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on a federal corporate income tax rate 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates  volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities  and the composition of those assets and liabilities 
the interest rate spread and net interest margin are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income 
the interest rate spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is defined as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
earning assets obtained through noninterest bearing sources of funds such as regular demand deposits and shareholders equity result in a net interest margin that is higher than the interest rate spread 

table of contents compared to net interest income for the year ended december  was million  a million  or  increase when compared to the million reported for our net interest margin increased by basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to for last year 
the increase in net interest income and corresponding increase in net interest margin is primarily attributable to the reduction in funding costs 
the company s cost of funds was during the month period ended december   compared to reported in the same period last year 
decreased rates on our primary non maturity deposit products and more aggressive pricing on time deposits have led to the decrease in funding costs 
the company s yield on earning assets was during the month period ended december   a decrease of basis points from the reported in the same period last year 
while our yield on loans increased year over year by basis points from to  our tax equivalent yield on investments decreased by basis points from to  resulting in the overall declining yield on earning assets for the year 
net interest income for the quarter ended december  was million  a million increase when compared to the million for the fourth quarter of while we remain intently focused on increasing the yield on earning assets and continuing to push down funding costs  we expect that continued margin expansion may be difficult in the current stagnant economic environment 
compared to net interest income for the year ended december  was million  a million increase when compared to the million reported for the same period in however  our net interest margin declined by basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year 
the federal reserve open market committee fomc  which sets the federal funds rate  kept rates at historically low levels throughout due to the global economic recession over the last months  deflating the yield on our investment portfolio as well as allowing us to decrease the rate on our cost of funds 
while the tax equivalent yield on earning assets decreased basis points during the year  from in to in  our yield on average loans held constant at basis points in and however  the yield on our investment portfolio decreased basis points from in to in additionally  our net interest margin was adversely impacted due to the significant increase in liquid assets maintained in interest bearing accounts which averaged million in as compared to million in on the liability side  we were successful in reducing our cost of funds including noninterest bearing deposits by basis points  from in to in net interest income for the quarter ended december  was million  a million increase when compared to the million reported for the same period in the following table presents the major categories of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity with corresponding average balances  related interest income or expense  and resulting yields and rates for the periods indicated

nontaxable interest income is adjusted to its fully taxable equivalent basis using a federal tax rate of percent 
the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income tax equivalent basis by average total earning assets 
non accrual loans are included in the above yield calculation 

table of contents as discussed above  the company s net interest income is affected by the change in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities referred to as volume change as well as by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds referred to as rate change 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  a summary of changes in interest income and interest expense for the major categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the amounts of change attributable to variations in volumes and rates

these risks involve interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk and equity market price risk 
the company s primary market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is inherent because as a financial institution  the company derives a significant amount of its operating revenue from purchasing funds customer deposits and borrowings at various terms and rates 
these funds are then invested into earning assets loans  leases  investments  etc 
at various terms and rates 
this risk is further discussed below 
equity market risk is not a significant risk to the company as equity investments on a cost basis comprise less than of corporate assets 
the company does not have any exposure to foreign currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to fluctuations in the company s future earnings earnings at risk and value economic value at risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
this exposure results from differences between the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that reprice within a specified time period as a result of scheduled maturities and repayment and contractual interest rate changes 
the primary objective of the company s asset liability management process is to maximize current and future net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate risk while satisfying liquidity and capital requirements 
management recognizes that a certain amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate  yet is not essential to the company s profitability 
thus the goal of interest rate risk management is to maintain a balance between risk and reward such that net interest income is maximized while risk is maintained at a tolerable level 

table of contents the company assumes interest rate risk the risk that general interest rate levels will change as a result of its normal operations 
management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk 
however  borrowers with fixed rate obligations are less likely to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment 
conversely  depositors who are receiving fixed rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity in a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling rate environment 
management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts to minimize interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new loans and deposits and by investing in securities with terms that mitigate the company s overall interest rate risk 
management endeavors to control the exposures to changes in interest rates by understanding  reviewing and making decisions based on its risk position 
the corporate asset liability management committee is responsible for these decisions 
the committee operates under management policies defining guidelines and limits on the level of acceptable risk 
these policies are approved by the boards of directors of the company and its banking subsidiary 
the company primarily uses the securities portfolios and fhlb advances to manage its interest rate risk position 
additionally  pricing  promotion and product development activities are directed in an effort to emphasize the loan and deposit term or repricing characteristics that best meet current interest rate risk objectives 
at present  the company does not use off balance sheet instruments 
the company uses simulation analysis to assess earnings at risk and economic value of equity analysis to assess value at risk 
these methods allow management to regularly monitor both the direction and magnitude of the company s interest rate risk exposure 
these modeling techniques involve assumptions and estimates that inherently cannot be measured with complete precision 
key assumptions in the analyses include maturity and repricing characteristics of both assets and liabilities  prepayments on amortizing assets  other embedded options  non maturity deposit sensitivity and loan and deposit pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
however  the analyses are useful in quantifying risk and provide a relative gauge of the company s interest rate risk position over time 
earnings at risk simulation analysis evaluates the effect of upward and downward changes in market interest rates on future net interest income 
the analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining net interest income over the next twelve months 
the resulting percentage change in net interest income in various rate scenarios is an indication of the company s shorter term interest rate risk 
various assumptions are applied to the measurement date balance sheet over the simulation time period to account for management s projection of balance sheet movement over the simulation period  including assumptions related to maturing and repayment dollars 
additional assumptions are applied to modify volumes and pricing under the various rate scenarios 
these include prepayment assumptions on mortgage assets  the sensitivity of non maturity deposit rates  and other factors deemed significant 
the base net interest income simulation performed at december   assumes interest rates are unchanged for the next twelve months 
the simulation then assumes that rates are shocked up and down across a bps range in bps increments 
the simulation analysis results are presented in the table below 
these results  as of december   indicate that the company would expect net interest income to increase over the next twelve months by assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of basis points and to increase by if rates shifted downward in the same manner 
the company was asset sensitive at december  as simulation results indicate that net interest income would increase in an upward rate environment 
the company s risk position is within the guidelines set by policy 
change in net interest income change in yield curve percentage amount in thousands basis points basis points level base case basis points basis points 
table of contents economic value of equity the economic value of equity eve analysis provides information on the risk inherent in the balance sheet that might not be taken into account in the simulation analysis due to the shorter time horizon used in that analysis 
the eve of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of expected asset cash flows minus the discounted present value of expected liability cash flows 
the economic value simulation uses instantaneous rate shocks to determine the expected cash flows in various rate scenarios 
the resulting percentage change in eve is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
the eve analysis results are presented in the table below 
these results as of december  indicate that eve would decrease assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of basis points and increase if rates shifted downward in the same manner 
the company s risk position is within the guidelines set by policy 
change in eve change in yield curve percentage amount in thousands basis points basis points level base case basis points basis points derivative financial instruments for asset liability management purposes  we may use interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate risk exposure to declining rates 
such derivatives are used as part of the asset liability management process and are linked to specific assets  and have a high correlation between the contract and the underlying item being hedged  both at inception and throughout the hedge period 
at december  and the company did not have any derivative agreements related to interest rate hedging in place 
noninterest income the following table presents the components of noninterest income and the variance or percentage change vs

we continue to be focused on hiring experienced mortgage originators and investment advisors to enhance our earnings from these two important lines of business 
income earned on bank owned life insurance also increased due to new policies purchased at the end of and again in noninterest income for the year ended december  decreased by  or as compared to the year ended december  the decrease when comparing to is attributable to the in gains on the sale of afs securities realized in as compared to million realized in absent these gains  non interest income increased  or as compared to for  non interest income increased in all other categories from 
table of contents year to year  however the most notable increases were in mortgage banking related fees and brokerage fee income due to a greater emphasis on growing our noninterest income 
noninterest expense the following table presents the components of noninterest expense and the variance or percentage change vs 
in thousands compensation expense occupancy and equipment expense data processing expense advertising and marketing expense insurance expense professional fees state franchise taxes foreclosed asset expenses  net other operating expenses total noninterest expense the increase when comparing to was mainly attributable to the following factors compensation expenses increased year over year due to increased profit sharing awards and performance bonuses awarded as a result of the company s exceptional performance measured against budget  increased retirement expenses  and merit  equity and promotional increases for all employees  insurance fees increased year over year due primarily to fdic adjustments made in the first quarter of and an increase in the assessment rate in the first half of the year  professional fees increased year over year primarily due to litigation costs incurred  and foreclosed asset expenses increased dramatically year over year due to the high level of foreclosed assets held throughout the year 
our noninterest expenses for included over million in extraordinary expenses for litigation and fdic insurance adjustments 
we expect to see significant savings from these two line items in due to the settlement of the litigation and a reduced assessment rate for fdic insurance 
we also anticipate a decline in the level of foreclosed asset expense for although we understand it will continue to be a large expense item until we are completely out of this recessionary environment 
taking these items into consideration  the gains realized on the sale of securities and these extraordinary expense items essentially offset each other when analyzing performance 
noninterest expense for the year ended december  increased by a total of million or over the same period in  from million to million 
the majority of the increase was in compensation related items due to a number of factors including annual merit increases for all employees  a reduction of salary deferrals related to loan originations  growth in our mortgage banking division  and profit sharing awards earned by all employees for exceptional performance measured against budget 
we also experienced an increase in our fdic insurance due primarily to our phenomenal deposit growth during income taxes for the year ended december   the company recorded million of expense resulting in an effective tax rate of compared to an income tax expense of million or in the tax preference items such as tax exempt interest income and income from boli are relatively comparable for and these preference items have the effect of reducing income tax expense during a year in which income is recognized  which reduces income tax expense in relation to pretax earnings  thus reducing the effective rate 

table of contents asset quality summary of allowance for loan losses we establish the allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings through a provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries of losses previously charged against the allowance are credited to the allowance 
the allowance represents an amount that  in our judgment  will be appropriate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
some of the factors we consider in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses are as follows an evaluation of the current loan portfolio  identified loan problems  loan volume outstanding  past loss experience  present and expected industry and economic conditions and  in particular  how such conditions relate to our market area  problem loan trends over a year historical time period  and loan growth trends over a year historical time period the general component of the reserve covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors 
an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect our estimate of probable losses 
it also reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management 
on a quarterly basis  we perform a detailed analysis of the allowance for loan losses to verify the adequacy and appropriateness of the allowance in meeting probable losses in the loan portfolio 
we use generally accepted accounting standards related to receivables and contingencies when segregating our portfolio into loans classified as impaired and non impaired loan pools and in analyzing our current portfolio to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
included in our potentially impaired loan category are our current watch list credits plus any additional credits which have been past due three or more times within the past month period 
we individually review these potentially impaired loans based on generally accepted accounting standards related to receivables and make a determination if the loan in fact is impaired 
we consider a loan impaired when we determine that is probable that we will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
we do not consider a loan impaired during a period of delay in payment if we expect the ultimate collection of all amounts due 
if it is found to be impaired  an allowance is established when the collateral value  discounted cash flows  or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
we recognize any impairment by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses or by adjusting an existing valuation allowance for the impaired loan with a corresponding charge or credit to bad debt expense 
the valuation allowance becomes our specific reserve for the specific loan 
we take the balance of our portfolio and add back to it any loans that were included in the potentially impaired loan category but that were found not to be impaired 
we then segregate the remaining portfolio into specific categories based on type of loan and review the groups of loans to estimate loss under generally accepted accounting standards based on contingencies 
we apply a specific loss factor to each category based upon our historical loss experience for each category of loans for the previous eight quarters 
the loss factor is multiplied by the outstanding balance in the loan category to estimate potential loss for our allowance for loan losses 
we then evaluate certain environmental and qualitative factors that are relevant to our portfolio and make a risk assessment of low  medium  or high for each factor 
an additional loss factor is assigned to the portfolio according to the risk assessment 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  because it requires estimates that may be significantly revised as more information becomes available 
bank regulators also periodically review the loan portfolio and other assets to assess their quality  and we employ independent  third party loan reviewers as well 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be significantly revised as more information becomes available 

table of contents loans are assigned to our watch list based upon our internal risk rating system 
there are three levels of accountability in the risk rating process 
the primary responsibility for risk identification lies with the account officer 
it is the account officer s responsibility for the initial and ongoing risk rating of all notes and commitments in his or her portfolio 
on a monthly basis  each account officer signs a credit risk rating certification attesting to the accuracy of the credit risk ratings for the loans in his or her loan portfolio 
the chief credit officer is responsible for periodically reviewing the risk rating process employed by the lending officers 
the chief credit officer is responsible for the accuracy and timeliness of account officer risk ratings and has the authority to override account officer risk ratings and initiate rating changes  if warranted 
finally  the bank has a loan review program to provide an independent validation of portfolio quality 
this independent review is intended to assess adherence to underwriting guidelines  proper credit analysis and documentation 
in addition  the loan review process is required to test the integrity  accuracy and timeliness of account officer risk ratings and to test the effectiveness of the credit administration s controls over the risk identification process 
risk management reports its findings to the board of directors 
we regularly review asset quality and re evaluate the allowance for loan losses 
however  no assurance can be given that unforeseen adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased provisions in the future 
our current market environment  with a nationwide recession  makes this risk even higher 
additionally  regulatory examiners may require us to recognize additions or reductions to the allowance based upon their judgment about the loan portfolio and other information available to them at the time of their examinations 
on a quarterly basis  the directors loan committee will review all loans on our watch list to determine proper action and reporting of any loans identified as substandard by the credit quality review 
additionally  the directors loan committee and the audit committee meet jointly at the end of each quarter to review in detail management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we believe that the allocated reserves are adequate for the impaired loans in our portfolio based upon a detailed review of the quality and pledged collateral of each individual loan considered impaired at each of the above referenced periods 
the allowance for loan losses was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding was approximately at december   which compares to approximately of total loans at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are primarily based on our historical loss experience  portfolio concentrations  evaluation of individual loans and economic conditions 
a total of million in specific reserves was included in the balance of the allowance for loan losses as of december  for impaired loans  which compares to a total of million as of december  we believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for expected losses in the loan portfolio  but there are no assurances that it will be

the company experienced a decrease in total loans of million during the company s concentration in acquisition and development credits as a percentage of capital decreased from at december  to at december  additionally  the company s total non owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio as a percentage of capital decreased from to year over year 
the company reduced its risk assessment from high to medium for real estate devaluation factors due to the fact that our appraisals of real estate are not revealing the significant declines in value as seen in and early the balance in the allowance and the allowance as a percentage of loans decreased during when compared to due to the following a reduction in specific reserves required on our impaired loan portfolio 
the company s specific reserve balance decreased from million at december  to million at december  due to charge offs taken during the year as well as the reversal of certain reserves not needed due to the successful resolution of problem credits during the year 
likewise  we experienced a reduction of million in our impaired loan category year over year 

table of contents the company experienced a decrease in total loans of million during the company experienced a million or reduction in its acquisition and development portfolio 
over million or of the charge offs taken during the last two years have been in this portfolio 
therefore the loss factor applied to the portfolio has increased  but it has increased on a declining balance  thereby producing a lower reserve requirement 
the company experienced a million reduction in its level of classified loans from to as the company has worked through the problem loans during through successful resolution  charge offs  and foreclosures  we have not experienced a significant number of new relationships downgraded to classified 
this is a primary indication of the stabilization of our portfolio

a loan will be placed on nonaccrual status when collection of all principal or interest is deemed unlikely 
a loan will be placed on nonaccrual status automatically when principal or interest is past due days or more  unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of being collected 
in this case  the loan will continue to accrue interest despite its past due status 
a restructured loan is a loan in which the original contract terms have been modified due to a borrower s financial condition or there has been a transfer of assets in full or partial satisfaction of the loan 
a modification of original contractual terms is generally a concession to a borrower that a lending institution would not normally consider 
based on generally accepted accounting standards for receivables  a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is likely that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts  including both principal and interest  due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement

table of contents deposits our major source of funds and liquidity is our deposit base 
deposits provide funding for our investment in loans and securities 
our primary objective is to increase core deposits as a means to fund asset growth at a lower cost 
interest paid for deposits must be managed carefully to control the level of interest expense 
we offer individuals and small to medium sized businesses a variety of deposit accounts  including checking  savings  money market and certificates of deposits 
the levels and mix of deposits are influenced by such factors as customer service  interest rates paid  service charges and the convenience of banking locations 
competition for deposits is intense from other depository institutions and money market funds  some of which offer interest rates higher than we pay 
we attempt to identify and implement pricing and marketing strategies designed to control the overall cost of deposits and to maintain a stable deposit mix

the commercial sweep program involves balances subject to repurchase agreements which are reported as short term borrowings rather than deposits since they are not fdic insured 
the program consists of a demand deposit account from which we invest available balances daily in securities on an overnight basis subject to repurchase 
on the following business day  we repurchase from the customer the securities for an amount equal to the amount of available balances invested in the securities 
interest is calculated daily at the rate applicable for each overnight period  however  it is posted to the customer accounts only once per month 
fhlb borrowings federal home loan bank advances are relatively cost effective funding sources and provide the company with the flexibility to structure borrowings in a manner that aids in the management of interest rate risk and liquidity

financial instruments with off balance sheet risk the bank is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments may involve  to varying degrees  credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets 
the contract amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement the bank has in particular classes of financial instruments 
credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because the other parties to a financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract 
the bank s maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
the bank requires collateral to support financial instruments when it is deemed necessary 
the bank evaluates customers creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer

table of contents capital adequacy the management of capital in a regulated financial services industry must properly balance return on equity to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital levels and related risk based capital ratios to satisfy regulatory requirements 
the company s capital management strategies have been developed to provide attractive rates of returns to shareholders  while maintaining its well capitalized position at the banking subsidiary 
the primary source of additional capital to the company is earnings retention  which represents net income less dividends declared 
following the company s entrance into a written agreement with the reserve bank on september   any decision by the board of directors to pay dividends on the series a preferred stock  interest on the preferred stock  or dividends on common stock will require the approval of the reserve bank

failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company and the subsidiary bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia  the company and its banking subsidiary must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and reclassifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company and its banking subsidiary to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to average assets 
as of december  and  the company and the subsidiary bank met all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and are categorized as well capitalized 
these capital amounts and ratios are incorporated by reference to note of the consolidated financial statements herein 
liquidity one of the principal goals of the bank s asset and liability management strategy is to maintain adequate liquidity 
liquidity measures our ability to meet our maturing obligations and existing commitments  to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels  to fund our operations and to provide for customers credit needs 
liquidity represents a financial institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds from alternative funding sources 
we sell excess funds overnight to provide an 
table of contents immediate source of liquidity and as of december  we had a total of million in overnight funds at the reserve bank 
liquid assets maintained in interest bearing accounts averaged million in compared to an average of million during the company also maintains approved lines of credit with correspondent banks as backup liquidity sources 
the secondary liquidity source for both short term and long term borrowings consists of a secured line of credit from the fhlb 
at december   the line of credit had million outstanding under a total available line of million 
borrowings from the fhlb are secured by a blanket collateral agreement on a pledged portion of the bank s family residential real estate loans  multifamily mortgage loans  and commercial mortgage collateral 
additionally  we have an established line of credit with the reserve bank s discount window that had no outstanding balance under a total available line of million at december  borrowings from the frb discount window are secured by a collateral agreement on a pledged portion of the bank s commercial and real estate construction collateral 
the company maintains a liquidity policy as a means to manage liquidity and the associated risk 
the policy includes a liquidity contingency plan the liquidity plan that is designed as a tool for the company to detect liquidity issues in order to protect depositors  creditors and shareholders 
the liquidity plan includes monitoring various internal and external indicators such as changes in core deposits and changes in market conditions 
it provides for timely responses to a wide variety of funding scenarios ranging from changes in loan demand to a decline in the company s quarterly earnings to a decline in market price of the company s stock 
the liquidity plan calls for specific responses designed to meet a wide range of liquidity needs based upon assessments that are performed on a recurring basis by the company and its board of directors 
as a result of our management of liquid assets and our ability to generate liquidity through alternative funding sources  we believe we maintain overall liquidity sufficient to meet our depositors requirements and satisfy our customers credit needs 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company and the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as do the prices of goods and services 
management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation
