our revenues included approximately million related to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates 
additionally  we recognized additional revenues of approximately million during as a result of our january  adoption of new revenue recognition guidance 
see our critical accounting policy disclosure and updated policy for revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges found in this item under the heading critical accounting policies and estimates for a further discussion of the impact of adoption of this guidance 
the changes in revenues are discussed in further detail in the section titled results of operations below 
the following table sets forth the percentage of our net revenues attributable to geographic regions for  and for the year ended december  americas europe  middle east and africa asia pacific the following table sets forth the percentage of our net revenues sold through indirect and direct sales channels for  and for the year ended december  indirect direct in  an increase in media enterprise revenues was a significant driver in the increased sales through direct channels  as compared to our gross margin percentage for the year ended december  improved to  compared to for this change was driven by an increase in products gross margin percentage to in  compared to in  and a slight increase in services gross margin percentage to in  compared to in the increase in products gross margin percentage for was the result of a decrease in products costs in  primarily due to shifts in product mix  and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates 
the slight increase in services gross margin percentage was largely the result of the increase of services revenues  partially offset by increased professional services costs  including loss provisions recorded in related to professional services contracts assumed as part of a acquisition 
for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million  compared to a net loss of million for the reduction in net loss was largely a result of our continuing focus on the management of both costs of revenues and operating expenses 
the net loss for included charges of million for acquisition related intangible asset amortization  restructuring costs of million  a loss from the sales of assets of million  and million for legal settlements and acquisition related costs 
the net loss for included charges of million for restructuring and other costs  million for acquisition related intangible asset amortization  million for a legal settlement and million related to acquisition activities  partially offset by a gain of million resulting from certain asset sales 
we continue to identify and implement changes across the company to help improve our operational performance 
throughout  we worked to develop an integrated planning process as a way to help us better predict business performance  make timely and impactful business decisions  and measure the business more effectively 
in the fourth quarter  we implemented the first phase of the process  sales inventory and operations planning  or siop 
we have also made progress in simplifying other areas of our business 
during  we moved to a more common hardware platform supporting multiple software product offerings  reduced the variations of product offerings to our creative enthusiast customers and began the implementation of unified licensing and software activation card programs as a way to improve our delivery capabilities and increase customer satisfaction 
during october  we committed to a restructuring plan intended to improve operational efficiencies 
actions under the plan included a reduction in force of approximately employees and the closure of our facility in irwindale  ca 
these actions were intended to allow us to continue to invest in our core businesses  as well as shift some resources into areas of the business that we believe offer us better revenue growth potential 
under the plan  we expect to incur total expenses related to termination benefits and facility costs of million to million 
during the year ended december   we recorded charges of million related to severance charges and million related to the irwindale closure 
as a result of the actions taken under the plan  we expect to realize annualized cost savings of between million and million 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report for risk factors that may cause our future results to differ materially from our current expectations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly reevaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the following revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges  stock based compensation  goodwill and intangible assets  the valuation of business combinations  income tax assets and liabilities  and restructuring charges and accruals 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  an amendment to accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  revenue recognition  and asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  an amendment to asc subtopic  software revenue recognition  or the updates 
as a result  our critical accounting policy for revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges has been updated to reflect adoption of this guidance 
asu no 
requires the allocation of revenue to each unit of accounting using the relative selling price of each deliverable for multiple element arrangements 
asu no 
also amends the accounting for multiple element arrangements to provide guidance on how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated and eliminates the use of the residual method by establishing a hierarchy of evidence to determine the stand alone selling price of a deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  third party evidence  or tpe  and the best estimate of selling price  or esp 
if vsoe is available  it is used to determine the selling price of a deliverable 
if vsoe is not available  the entity must determine whether tpe is available 
if so  tpe would be used to determine the selling price 
if tpe is not available  then the entity is required to determine an esp 
asu no 
amends asc subtopic to exclude from the scope of software revenue recognition requirements sales of tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver the essential functionality of the tangible products 
the updates also include new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
the updates must be adopted in the same period using the same transition method and are effective prospectively  with retrospective adoption permitted 
we adopted the updates prospectively for new and materially modified arrangements originating after december  prior to adoption of the updates  we generally recognized revenues using the revenue recognition criteria of asc subtopic  software revenue recognition 
as a result of adoption of asu no 
on january   we will now typically recognize revenue using the criteria of asc topic  revenue recognition 
historically  we were generally able to establish vsoe for undelivered elements in multiple element arrangements as allowed by asc subtopic and  therefore  could typically recognize revenues for each element of multiple element arrangements as the element was delivered 
under the new guidance our recognition of revenues may be recognized in an earlier period for a limited number of multiple element arrangements for which vsoe could not be established for all undelivered elements under the previous guidance 
for those arrangements  we will now determine a relative selling price for the undelivered elements through the use of tpe or esp  and the recognition of certain revenues that would have been deferred under the previous guidance will typically be recognized at the time of delivery under the new guidance  provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
adoption of the updates resulted in an increase in our consolidated net revenues of approximately million during we cannot reasonably estimate the effect of the adoption of these standards on future financial periods as the impact will vary depending on the nature and volume of new or materially modified arrangements in any given period 
we believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and involve our most difficult and subjective estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenues we report 
for example  we often receive multiple purchase orders or contracts from a single customer or a group of related parties that are evaluated to determine if they are  in effect  parts of a single arrangement 
if they are determined to be parts of a single arrangement  revenues are recorded as if a single multiple element arrangement exists 
generally  the products we sell do not require significant production  modification or customization of software 
installation of the products is generally routine  consists of implementation and configuration and does not have to be performed by avid 
however  certain transactions for our video products  typically complex solution sales that include a significant number of products and may involve multiple customer sites  require us to perform an installation effort that we may deem to be complex  non routine and essential to the functionality of the products delivered 
in these situations  we do not recognize revenues for either the products shipped or services performed until the essential services have been completed 
in addition  if these orders include a customer acceptance provision  no revenues are recognized until the customer s formal acceptance of the products and services has been received 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  an amendment to asc topic  revenue recognition  and asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  an amendment to asc subtopic  software revenue recognition 
asu no 
requires the allocation of revenue  based on the relative selling price of each deliverable  to each unit of accounting for multiple element arrangements 
it also changes the level of evidence of standalone selling price required to separate deliverables by allowing a best estimate of the standalone selling price of deliverables when more objective evidence of fair value  such as vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence  is not available 
asu no 
amends asc subtopic to exclude sales of tangible products containing both software and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality from the scope of revenue recognition requirements for software arrangements 
we adopted this accounting guidance prospectively and applied its provisions to arrangements entered into or materially modified after december  we recognize revenue from the sale of non software products  including software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware  under the general revenue recognition accounting guidance of asc topic  revenue recognition and asc subtopic revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with asc subtopic  software revenue recognition for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products and related upgrades and ii sales of software elements bundled with non software elements  when the software elements are not essential to the functionality of the non software elements 
for and future periods  pursuant to the guidance of asu no 
 when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as non software products  software products  customer support services  and or professional services  we allocate revenue to each element based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy 
revenue is allocated to the non software deliverables as a group and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy 
if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable  the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then recognized using the guidance for recognizing software revenue  as amended 
the process for determining our esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe involves management s judgment 
we generally determine esp based on the following 
we utilize a pricing model for our products to capture the right value given the product and market context 
the model considers such factors as i competitive reference prices for products that are similar but not functionally equivalent  ii differential value based on specific feature sets  iii geographic regions where the products are sold  iv customer price sensitivity  v price cost volume tradeoffs  and vi volume based pricing 
management approval ensures that all of our selling prices are consistent and within an acceptable range for use with the relative selling price method 
while the pricing model currently in use captures all critical variables  unforeseen changes due to external market forces may result in the revision of some of our inputs 
these modifications may result in consideration allocation in future periods that differs from the one presently in use 
absent a significant change in the pricing inputs  future changes in the pricing model are not expected to materially impact our allocation of arrangement consideration 
from time to time  we offer certain customers free upgrades or specified future products or enhancements 
for software products  if elements are undelivered at the time of product shipment and provided that we have vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements  we defer the fair value of the specified upgrade  product or enhancement and recognize those revenues only upon later delivery or at the time at which the remaining contractual terms relating to the elements have been satisfied 
if we cannot establish vsoe for each undelivered element  all revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered  we establish vsoe or the remaining contractual terms relating to the undelivered elements have been satisfied 
for non software products  if elements are undelivered at the time of product shipment  we defer the relative selling price of the specified upgrade  product or enhancement and recognize those revenues only upon later delivery or at the time at which the remaining contractual terms relating to the elements have been satisfied 
approximately of our revenues were derived from indirect sales channels  including authorized resellers and distributors 
certain channel partners are offered limited rights of return  stock rotation and price protection 
for these partners  we record a provision for estimated returns and other allowances as a reduction of revenues in the same period that related revenues are recorded in accordance with asc subtopic  revenue recognition products 
management estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing and maintaining a sales allowance for expected returns and other credits 
in making these estimates  we analyze historical returns and credits and the amounts of products held by major resellers and consider the impact of new product introductions  changes in customer demand  current economic conditions and other known factors 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
the amount and timing of our revenues for any period may be affected if actual product returns or other reseller credits prove to be materially different from our estimates 
a portion of our revenues from sales of consumer video editing and audio products is derived from transactions with channel partners who have unlimited return rights and from whom payment is contingent upon the product being sold through to their customers 
accordingly  revenues for these channel partners are recognized when the products are sold through to the customer instead of being recognized at the time products are shipped to the channel partners 
at the time of a sales transaction  we make an assessment of the collectability of the amount due from the customer 
revenues are recognized only if it is probable that collection will occur in a timely manner 
in making this assessment  we consider customer credit worthiness and historical payment experience 
if it is determined from the outset of the arrangement that collection is not probable based on our credit review process  revenues are recognized on a cash collected basis to the extent that the other criteria of asc topic  asc subtopic and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
are satisfied 
at the outset of the arrangement  we assess whether the fee associated with the order is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties 
in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable  we consider the payment terms of the transaction  our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions  and our involvement  if any  in third party financing transactions  among other factors 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenues are recognized only as payments become due from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are generally days  but can be up to days  after the invoice date  we evaluate whether we have sufficient history of successfully collecting past transactions with similar terms 
if that collection history is sufficient  revenues are recognized upon delivery of the products  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
if we were to change any of these assumptions and judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue reported in a particular period 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation  which requires the application of a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
during  we granted both stock options and restricted stock units as part of our key performer stock based compensation program  as well as stock options and restricted stock units to newly hired employees 
in prior years  we have also issued restricted stock  and we refer to restricted stock and restricted stock units collectively as restricted stock awards 
the vesting of stock options and restricted stock awards may be based on time  performance  market conditions  or a combination of performance and market conditions 
in the future  we may grant stock awards  options  or other equity based instruments allowed by our stock based compensation plans  or a combination thereof  as part of our overall compensation strategy 
the fair values of restricted stock awards with time based vesting  including restricted stock and restricted stock units  are generally based on the intrinsic values of the awards at the date of grant 
as permitted under asc topic  we generally use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants 
the black scholes model relies on a number of key assumptions to calculate estimated fair values 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on recent six month trailing implied volatility calculations 
these calculations are performed on exchange traded options of our common stock based on the implied volatility of long term to month term exchange traded options 
we believe that using a forward looking market driven volatility assumption will result in the best estimate of expected volatility 
the assumed risk free interest rate is the us treasury security rate with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
the assumed expected life is based on company specific historical experience 
with regard to the estimate of the expected life  we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises 
we also issue stock option grants or restricted stock unit awards with vesting based on market conditions  specifically avid s stock price  or a combination of performance  generally our return on equity  or market conditions 
the fair values and derived service periods for all grants that have vesting based on market conditions are estimated using the monte carlo valuation method 
for stock option grants with vesting based on a combination of performance or market conditions  the fair values are also estimated using the black scholes valuation method  and compensation costs for these grants are recorded based on the higher estimated fair value for each vesting tranche and factored for the estimated probability of achieving the performance goals 
for restricted stock unit awards with vesting based on a combination of performance or market conditions  the fair values are also estimated based on the intrinsic values of the awards at the date of grant  and compensation costs for these grants are also recorded based on the higher estimated fair value for each vesting tranche and factored for the estimated probability of achieving the performance goals 
for each stock option grant and restricted stock award with vesting based on a combination of performance or market conditions where vesting will occur if either condition is met  the related compensation costs are recognized over the shorter of the derived service period or implicit service period 
we estimate forfeiture rates at the time awards are made based on historical and estimated future turnover rates and apply these rates in the calculation of estimated compensation cost 
the estimation of forfeiture rates includes a quarterly review of historical turnover rates and an update of the estimated forfeiture rates to be applied to employee classes for the calculation of stock based compensation 
for  forfeiture rates for the calculation of stock based compensation were estimated and applied based on three classes non employee directors  executive management staff and other employees 
at december   our annualized estimated forfeiture rates were for non employee director awards and for both executive management staff and other employee awards 
then current estimated forfeiture rates are also applied quarterly to all outstanding stock options and non vested restricted stock awards  which may result in a revised estimate of compensation costs related to these stock based grants 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  including changes in the probability of achieving performance conditions  or we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense recognized in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see notes b and n to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding stock based compensation 
goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or component thereof will be sold or otherwise disposed of  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  a reduction of our market capitalization relative to our net book value and other similar circumstances 
in accordance with asc subtopic  intangibles goodwill and others goodwill  we do not amortize goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test prescribed by asc requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units at the date we test for impairment 
our organizational structure in was based on a single reporting unit 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year 
in accordance with asc subtopic  intangibles goodwill and others goodwill  a two step process is used to test for goodwill impairment 
the first step determines if there is an indication of impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our single reporting unit to its carrying value including existing goodwill 
upon an indication of impairment from the first step  a second step is performed to determine if goodwill impairment exists 
to estimate the fair value of our single reporting unit for step one  we utilize a combination of market and income approaches 
since we have one reporting unit  we believe that the direct market capitalization approach  which considers our market capitalization including an implied control premium  is the most relevant measure and is weighted most heavily 
we also use other market approaches including the guideline public company market approach  under which we identify similar public companies and derive estimated market multiples of revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  or ebitda  and apply those multiples to our historical and forecasted results to estimate the fair value of our single reporting unit  and the guideline transaction market approach  under which we identify recent sale transactions involving similar companies and derive estimated transaction multiples of revenue and ebitda and apply those multiples to our historical and forecasted results to estimate the fair value of our single reporting unit 
the income approaches  specifically discounted cash flow methodologies  include assumptions for  among others  forecasted revenues  gross profit margins  operating profit margins  working capital cash flows  capital expenditures  growth rates  income tax rates  expected tax benefits  terminal values and long term discount rates  all of which require significant judgments by management 
goodwill is also tested for impairment when events and circumstances occur that indicate that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
at september   as a result of a decline in our stock price since our fourth quarter goodwill impairment testing  lower than expected year to date revenues and operating results  and a reduction in forecasted results  we performed an interim step one goodwill impairment test 
the interim step one test at september  indicated that the estimated fair value of our single reporting unit approximately million exceeded the carrying value of million by approximately 
therefore  no goodwill impairment existed at september   and we were not required to perform step two 
in connection with our interim goodwill step one impairment test at september   we weighted the direct market capitalization approach at  the income approaches at  the guideline public company market approaches at  and the guideline transaction market approaches at 
the estimated fair value under the direct market capitalization approach was calculated by applying control premiums of approximately to our market capitalization 
our market capitalization was calculated using the average stock price of our common stock for the trading days prior to september  per share 
if we had used the closing stock price of our common stock on september  per share in the direct market capitalization approach described above and applied similar weightings  the estimated fair value of our single reporting would have exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of determined that no goodwill impairment existed at december  at that date  we performed a step one test using the same approach weightings as were used for the september  interim impairment test 
the step one test at december  indicated that the estimated fair value of our single reporting unit approximately million exceeded the carrying value of million by approximately 
therefore  no goodwill impairment existed at december   and we were not required to perform step two 
the estimated fair value under the direct market capitalization approach was calculated by applying control premiums of approximately to our market capitalization 
our market capitalization was calculated using the average stock price of our common stock for the trading days prior to december  per share 
if we had used the closing stock price of our common stock on december  per share in the direct market capitalization approach described above and applied similar weightings  the estimated fair value of our single reporting would have exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
at december   our market capitalization based on the closing stock price of per share at that date was approximately million  compared to the carrying value of the our single reporting unit of million 
this implied a control premium of approximately 
subsequent to december   the volatility of the price of our stock has continued 
on february   the closing price of our common stock was per share 
identifiable intangible assets are also tested for impairment in accordance with asc section  property  plant and equipment overall subsequent measurement  if events or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the fair value of each asset is compared to its carrying value  and if the asset s carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value 
the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
changes in business conditions or our assumptions could require that we record impairment charges related to our identifiable intangible assets 
assumptions  judgments and estimates of future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or forecasts 
although we believe our past assumptions  judgments and estimates used in calculating fair values for goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment testing are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
valuation of business combinations when we acquire new businesses  we allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets  including intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values  with any amount in excess of such allocations designated as goodwill 
significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  particularly acquired intangible assets 
for example  it is necessary to estimate the portion of development efforts that are associated with technology that is in process and has no alternative future use 
the valuation of purchased intangible assets is based on estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business  discount rates  tax rates and other assumptions 
the use of different assumptions could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations 
income tax assets and liabilities we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes compared to the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability with consideration for such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
asc topic  income taxes  requires us to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on our level of deferred tax assets at december  and our level of historical us losses  we have determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the need for a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets 
we have also determined that a valuation allowance is warranted on a portion of our foreign deferred tax assets 
our assessment of the valuation allowance on our us and foreign deferred tax assets could change in the future based on our levels of pre tax income and other tax related adjustments 
reversal of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a non cash reduction in income tax expense during the period of reversal 
to the extent some or all of our valuation allowance is reversed  future financial statements would reflect an increase in non cash income tax expense until such time as our deferred tax assets are fully utilized 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file 
we have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws 
there can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of applicable law and assess us with additional taxes 
should we be assessed with additional taxes  it could have a negative impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
asc topic requires that a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained before being recognized in the financial statements 
it also requires the accrual of interest and penalties as applicable on our unrecognized tax positions 
at december  and  we had gross unrecognized tax benefits  including interest  of million and million  respectively 
if these benefits had been recognized  million and million  respectively  would have resulted in a reduction of our effective tax rates at december  and restructuring charges and accruals we record facility related restructuring charges in accordance with asc topic  liabilities exit or disposal cost obligations 
based on our policies for the calculation and payment of severance benefits  we account for employee related restructuring charges as an ongoing benefit arrangement in accordance with asc topic  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits 
we recognize charges for the consolidation of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises 
the decision to vacate excess facilities results in charges for future commitments to pay lease and other ongoing facility related expenses  net of estimated future sublease income  fixed asset write offs  and lease termination costs  if applicable 
we estimate the fair value of such liabilities using an income approach based on observable inputs  including the remaining payments required under the existing lease agreements  utilities costs based on recent invoice amounts  and potential sublease receipts based on quoted market prices for similar sublease arrangements 
the liabilities are discounted to net present value based on our current borrowing rate 
severance related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred  which is when the expected severance payments are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
restructuring charges and accruals require significant estimates and assumptions  including sub lease income and severance period assumptions 
our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control  including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates 
the estimates and assumptions are monitored on at least a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances and any corresponding adjustments to the accrual are recorded in our statement of operations in the period when such changes are known 
if actual results differ significantly from our current estimates  we may be required to adjust our restructuring accruals in the future 
results of operations net revenues our net revenues are derived mainly from sales of computer based digital  nonlinear media editing and finishing systems and related peripherals  including shared storage systems  software licenses  and related professional services and maintenance contracts 
we expect to have low single digit percentage revenue growth in  compared to net revenues for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands change net revenues net revenues video products revenues audio products revenues products revenues services revenues total net revenues net revenues for the year ended december  and dollars in thousands change net revenues net revenues video products revenues audio products revenues products revenues services revenues total net revenues the million decrease in our total revenues for  compared to  consisted of a million decrease in our video products revenues and a million decrease in our audio products revenues  partially offset by a million increase in our services revenues 
the decrease in total net revenues included approximately million for the favorable impact of currency exchange rates 
during  we recognized million in products revenues as a result of our january  adoption of new revenue recognition guidance 
see our critical accounting policy disclosure and updated policy for revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges found previously in this item under the heading critical accounting policies and estimates for a further discussion of the impact of adoption of this guidance 
the million increase in our total revenues for  compared to  consisted of a million increase in our audio products revenues and a million increase in our video products revenues  partially offset by a million decrease in our services revenues 
the increase in total net revenues  which was primarily the result of higher sales volumes for many of our product lines  included a million increase resulting from our acquisitions and a million decrease for the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates 
video products revenues the decrease in our video products revenues for  compared to  was primarily the result of decreased revenues from our professional video editing and  to a lesser extent  consumer video editing product lines 
these decreases were partially offset by increased revenues from our shared storage and interplay product lines 
avid media composer software had strong unit sales  largely driven by version upgrades and promotions during the periods designed to encourage users of certain competitive products to switch to avid media composer  but professional video editing revenues were down due to decreased revenues from our hardware based video editing solutions  driven largely by a shift from hardware based to software only solutions 
the decrease in revenues from our consumer video editing offerings was also largely driven by a shift in mix to software only products 
video products revenues increased in europe and decreased in the americas and asia pacific regions during  compared to the increase in our video products revenues for  compared to  was primarily the result of increased revenues from sales of our isis shared storage systems and professional editors  as well as increased revenues from our interplay production and media asset management products and our broadcast newsroom product lines 
the increase in our isis shared storage revenues was driven by increases in both volume and average selling price  while the increased revenues for professional editors and interplay products were the result of increased volumes 
the release of a new version of media composer during the second quarter of was a significant factor in the increased professional editor volumes 
the increase for our broadcast newsroom product lines was driven by an increase in average selling price 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from our consumer editor product lines on lower sales volumes  which was due to overall weakness in that market and our lack of new product introductions 
video products revenues increased in the americas and asia pacific regions during  compared to  but decreased in europe where our revenues were impacted by unfavorable currency exchange rates 
audio products revenues the decrease in our audio products revenues for  compared to  was largely the result of decreased revenues from our higher end audio systems  including the discontinuation of certain older product lines  partially offset by increases in revenues from our audio control surfaces  venue live sound consoles and speaker product lines in the period 
the audio control surfaces revenues benefited from an increase in revenues attributable to our april acquisition of euphonix 
the decrease in revenues from our higher end audio systems was largely due to slower than anticipated market adoption of some of our pro tools hd hardware products launched in the fourth quarter of  as well as a shift in mix to pro tools software only products  which experienced strong first quarter sales following the pro tools introduction 
audio products revenues for the first half of last year also benefited from successful upgrade promotions  not present in the period  for high end professional audio products 
audio products revenues decreased in all regions during  compared to the increase in our audio products revenues for  compared to  included revenues of million related to our april acquisition of euphonix 
while this accounted for of the increase  revenues from our professional audio products and venue live sound product lines were higher in on increased sales volumes 
the increased volumes for our professional audio products was due to increased sales volumes resulting from sales promotions offered during the first six months of and the introduction of pro tools during the fourth quarter of audio product revenues increased in all geographic regions during  compared to  despite the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates on our revenues in europe 
services revenues services revenues are derived primarily from maintenance contracts  as well as professional and integration services and training 
the increase in services revenues for  compared to  was primarily the result of increased maintenance revenues  driven by new maintenance contracts and improved renewal rates for existing contracts  as well as increased revenues from professional services and training 
during  we began to include a one year of maintenance contract with certain product sales 
while this has had a slightly positive effect on maintenance revenues  the effect on future maintenance revenues will depend on the level of renewal rates on these contracts 
services revenues increased in the americas and europe during  compared to  while asia pacific revenues decreased due to lower professional services revenues in that region 
the decrease in services revenues for  compared to  was the result of decreases in maintenance and training revenues  partially offset by an increase in professional and integration services revenues  and included an increase of million resulting from our acquisitions 
the decrease in maintenance revenues was largely the result of declining renewal rates for previously discontinued product lines 
services revenues decreased in the americas and europe and increased in the asia pacific region during  compared to cost of revenues  gross profit and gross margin percentage cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the procurement of components  the assembly  testing and distribution of finished products  warehousing  customer support costs related to maintenance contract revenues and other services  royalties for third party software and hardware included in our products amortization of technology  and providing professional services and training

the products gross margin percentage for also benefited from favorable currency exchange rates  but was negatively impacted by certain unusual charges recorded in  including a charge related to a change in our third party logistics provider in north america 
increased products costs resulted in a slight decrease in products gross margin percentage in  compared to increased freight costs resulting from increased shipment volumes  including the increased use of more expensive air freight to support new product introductions and meet increased demand for certain products  was a significant factor in the increased product costs 
additionally  the unfavorable impact on revenues of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was also a factor in our products gross margin percentage decrease in the slight increase in services gross margin percentage for  compared to  was the result of increased services revenues  partially offset by the impact of increased costs to provide professional services in the professional services costs for included loss provisions related to professional services contracts assumed as part of a acquisition

during  we recorded million related to severance costs and million for the closure of the irwindale facility  which included non cash amounts totaling million for fixed asset write offs 
under the plan  we expect to incur total expenses related to termination benefits and facility costs of million to million  most of which represents cash expenditures 
we expect to complete all actions under the plan prior to june  restructuring plans in december  we initiated a worldwide restructuring plan  or the plan  designed to better align financial and human resources in accordance with its strategic plans for the fiscal year 
in connection with the restructuring  we eliminated positions that were in lower growth geographies and markets and reinvested in more strategic areas with greater opportunity for growth 
the plan also called for streamlining internal operations while making key investments in organizational efficiencies and to close portions of certain office facilities 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to severance costs for the elimination of positions and million for the partial closure of a facility 
during  we revised its previously recorded estimates of severance costs resulting in a restructuring benefit of million and recorded a restructuring charge of million resulting from the revised estimate of the costs associated with the partial facility closure 
the severance revisions primarily resulted from the final severance negotiations for certain european employees  as well as the transferring of certain employees into alternative positions at avid 
during  we also recorded facilities restructuring charges of approximately million related to the closure of a facility in germany  which included non cash amounts totaling million for fixed asset write offs 
to date  total restructuring charges of approximately million have been recorded under the plan  and no further restructuring actions are anticipated under this plan 
during  we also initiated acquisition related restructuring actions that resulted in restructuring charges of million for the severance costs for former euphonix employees and the closure of three euphonix facilities 
during  we recorded additional restructuring charges of approximately million  primarily resulting from revised estimates for the write off of fixed assets related to the facilities closures 
no further restructuring actions are anticipated under this plan 
restructuring plan in october  we initiated a company wide restructuring plan  or the plan  that included a reduction in force of approximately positions  including employees related to product line divestitures  and the closure of all or parts of some facilities worldwide 
the plan is intended to improve operational efficiencies and bring costs in line with expected revenues 
in connection with the plan  during the fourth quarter of we recorded restructuring charges of million related to employee termination costs and million for the closure of three small facilities

the charges resulting from the reduction in force of additional employees were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of and were primarily the result of the expanded use of offshore development resources for r d projects and our desire to better align our cost structure with revenue expectations

the net tax provision of million for reflected a current tax provision of million and a deferred tax benefit of million  mostly related to the foreign amortization of nondeductible acquisition related intangible assets and the release of valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
the net tax benefit of million for reflected a current tax benefit of million and a deferred tax benefit of million mostly related to the foreign amortization of non deductible acquisition related intangible assets and the release of a valuation allowance on a portion of the deferred tax assets in our canadian entity 
our effective tax rate  which represents our tax provision benefit as a percentage of profit or loss before taxes  was  and  respectively  for  and although we reported worldwide pre tax losses for  and  we generated taxable profits in certain foreign jurisdictions  and our tax provision is primarily attributable to taxes payable on the income earned by these profitable foreign subsidiaries 
the increases in both our tax provision and effective tax rate for  compared to  were primarily the result of changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings and fewer favorable discrete tax benefits during  compared to our provision for benefit from income taxes and effective tax rate both changed from net benefits in to net provisions in these changes were the result of significant favorable discrete tax benefits in that exceeded the favorable discrete tax benefits in  partially offset by a reduction in tax in from refinements in the way profit gets allocated among legal entities 
we generally recognize no significant us tax benefit from acquisition related amortization 
the tax rate in each year is affected by net changes in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate would have been  and  respectively  for the years  and these rates differ from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the mix of income and losses in foreign jurisdictions  which have tax rates that differ from the statutory rate  non deductible acquisition related expenses and other discrete items 
we file in multiple tax jurisdictions and from time to time are subject to audit in certain tax jurisdictions  but we believe that we are adequately reserved for these exposures 
see note p to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report for additional income tax disclosures for the years ended december   and liquidity and capital resources liquidity and sources of cash we have generally funded our operations in recent years through the use of existing cash balances  which we have supplemented since the fourth quarter of with borrowings under our credit facilities 
at december  and  our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million  respectively  and available borrowings under our credit facilities as discussed below 
at december   the cash available in our foreign subsidiaries totaled million 
we do not have any plans to repatriate these earnings because the underlying cash is required to fund the ongoing foreign operations 
the additional taxes that might be payable upon repatriation of foreign earnings are not significant 
on october   we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo capital finance llc  or wells fargo  which established two revolving credit facilities with combined maximum availability of up to million for borrowings or letter of credit guarantees 
the actual amount of credit available to us will vary depending upon changes in the level of the respective accounts receivable and inventory  and is subject to other terms and conditions which are more specifically described in the credit agreement 
the credit facilities have a maturity date of october   at which time wells fargo s commitments to provide additional credit will terminate and all outstanding borrowings must be repaid 
prior to the maturity of the credit facilities  any amounts borrowed may be repaid and  subject to the terms and conditions of the credit agreement  reborrowed in whole or in part without penalty 
the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties  covenants  mandatory prepayments  and events of default under which our payment obligations may be accelerated  including guarantees and liens on substantially all of our assets to secure their obligations under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement requires that avid technology  inc  our parent company  maintain liquidity comprised of unused availability under its portion of the credit facilities plus certain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million  at least million of which must be from unused availability under its portion of the credit facilities  and our subsidiary  avid technology international bv  or avid europe  is required to maintain liquidity comprised of unused availability under the avid europe portion of the credit facilities plus certain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million  at least million of which must be from unused availability under the avid europe portion of the credit facilities 
interest accrues on outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities at a rate of either libor plus or a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus  at the option of avid technology  inc or avid europe  as applicable 
we must also pay wells fargo a monthly unused line fee at a rate of per annum 
we incur certain loan fees and costs associated with our credit facilities 
such costs are capitalized as deferred borrowing costs and amortized as interest expense on a straight line basis over the term of the credit agreement 
at december   the balance of our deferred borrowing costs was million  net of accumulated amortization costs of million 
during the first quarter of  our us operations borrowed million against the credit facilities to meet certain short term cash requirements  all of which was repaid during the first quarter of during the second quarter of  our us operations borrowed million against the credit facilities to meet certain short term cash requirements  all of which had been repaid as of december  at december   avid technology  inc and avid europe had letters of credit guaranteed under the credit facilities of million and million  respectively 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt agreement covenants  and avid technology  inc and avid europe had available borrowings under the credit facilities of approximately million and million  respectively  after taking into consideration the outstanding letters of credit and related liquidity covenant 
subsequent to december  but prior to the issuance of the financial statements included in this report  we borrowed and repaid million under the credit line 
we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities as of the date of issuance of the financial statements 
although we expect our net cash balance to increase during  we may borrow against the line of credit above the current outstanding borrowings to cover cash requirements as may be required to meet the short term funding needs of the business 
our cash requirements vary depending on factors such as the growth of our business  changes in working capital  capital expenditures  our acquisition of businesses or technologies and obligations under restructuring programs 
we believe that we have sufficient cash  cash equivalents  funds generated from operations and funds available under the credit facilities to meet our operational and strategic objectives for at least the next twelve months 
the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected the positive impact of our net loss after adjustment for non cash items  in particular depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense 
this was partially offset by changes in working capital items  in particular a decrease in accrued liabilities 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities primarily reflected changes in working capital items  in particular increases in inventories and accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
these changes were also partially offset by the positive impact of our net loss after adjustment for non cash items  in particular depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities primarily reflected our net loss adjusted for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense  as well as changes in working capital items  in particular decreases in deferred revenues and accrued liabilities  partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory 
accounts receivable increased by million to million at december  from million at december  these balances are net of allowances for sales returns  bad debts and customer rebates  all of which we estimate and record based primarily on historical experience 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable  or dso  was days at december   compared to days at december  our accounts receivable aging at december  is within historical ranges  and we believe the increase in our dso is the result of the timing of revenue recognition and customer receipts  as well as the impact of foreign currency translation on our accounts receivables balances 
inventories increased by million to million at december  from million at december  these balances included stockroom  spares and demonstration equipment inventories at various locations  as well as inventory at customer sites related to shipments for which we had not yet recognized revenue 
the increase in inventories at december  was the result of increased stocking levels during the first half of related to lower than expected revenues  as well as a buildup of inventory related to new product introductions 
during parts of  we experienced certain supply chain shortages that impacted our ability to meet the demand for certain of our products 
based on our current product forecasts  we believe we will be able to meet product demand for based on our current inventory levels and anticipated component purchases 
our inventories decreased during the fourth quarter of  and we expect the levels to decrease modestly during as we continue to work to better optimize our supply chain 
we review all inventory balances regularly for excess quantities or potential obsolescence and make appropriate adjustments as needed to write down the inventories to reflect their estimated realizable value 
we source inventory products and components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
accounts payable decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  this decrease is primarily the result of decreased purchases and the associated timing of cash payments to our vendors 
accrued liabilities  including accrued payroll and benefits  decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was largely the result of decreased accruals for payroll and other compensation  primarily due to the payment in of bonuses accrued at december   and payment in for restructuring related obligations incurred in connection with restructuring activities during and prior periods 
at december   we had restructuring accruals of million and million related to severance and lease obligations  respectively  including million in lease obligations recorded as long term liabilities 
our future cash obligations for leases for which we have vacated the underlying facilities totaled approximately million at december  the lease accruals represent the present value of the excess of our lease commitments on the vacated space over expected payments to be received on subleases of the relevant facilities 
the lease payments will be made over the remaining terms of the leases  which have varying expiration dates through  unless we are able to negotiate earlier terminations 
the severance payments will be made during the next twelve months 
cash payments resulting from restructuring obligations totaled approximately million during all payments related to restructuring actions are expected to be funded through working capital 
see note q of our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for the activity in the restructuring and other costs accrual during deferred revenues  including long term amounts  increased by million to million at december   from million at december  this increase was largely the result of an increase in deferrals related to maintenance obligations  resulting from an increase in new maintenance contracts  improved renewal rates for existing contracts and the timing of contract renewals  as well as deferrals for other maintenance obligations 
cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december   the net cash flow used in investing activities primarily reflected million used for the purchase of property and equipment and a million increase in other long term assets 
for the year ended december   the net cash flow used in investing activities primarily reflected million used for the purchase of property and equipment and million paid to acquire blue order and euphonix  partially offset by net proceeds of million resulting from the timing of the sale and purchase of marketable securities and the release of escrow holdings totaling million related to the sale of our softimage d animation product line 
for the year ended december   the net cash flow used in investing activities primarily reflected million used for the purchase of property and equipment  a million facility related escrow deposit into a long term asset account and million paid for our acquisition of maxt  partially offset by net proceeds of million resulting from the timing of the sale and purchase of marketable securities and the release of escrow holdings totaling million also related to the sale of our softimage d animation product line 
the million facility related escrow deposit in was related to our leases for new headquarters facilities in burlington  massachusetts 
while our purchases of property and equipment typically consist of computer hardware and software to support our r d activities and information systems  the significant decrease in property and equipment purchases in the period primarily reflected our increased costs in  which were not present in  for leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment associated with the relocation of our corporate offices to burlington  massachusetts in june during  leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment related to this relocation were placed in service and resulted in fixed asset additions of approximately million  of which million represented cash expenditures during the period 
during the same period  we wrote off fixed assets with gross book values and net book values of approximately million and million  respectively  that were related to the closure of our former headquarters facility 
we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than those for cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december   the net cash flow provided by financing activities reflected proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by costs associated with tax withholding obligations related to the issuance of common stock under the plans 
during  our us operations borrowed funds under our revolving credit facilities to meet certain short term cash requirements  none of which was outstanding at december  at december   we were in compliance with all debt agreement covenants  and avid technology  inc and avid europe had available borrowings under the credit facilities of approximately million and million  respectively  after taking into consideration outstanding letters of credit and the related liquidity covenant

also during  our us operations borrowed and repaid million against our revolving credit facilities to meet certain short term cash requirements 
for the year ended december   the net cash flow provided by financing activities in reflected proceeds from the issuance of stock related to the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by costs associated with tax withholding obligations resulting from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and million used to repurchase stock options during the second quarter of fair value measurements we value our cash and investment instruments using quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency

contractual and commercial obligations the following table sets forth future payments that we were obligated to make at december  under existing lease agreements and commitments to purchase inventory and other goods and services in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other contractual arrangements or unrecognized tax positions that may result in cash payments consisted of the following at december  in thousands total less than year years years after years other a transactions with recourse unrecognized tax positions and related interest stand by letters of credit a at december   liability related to unrecognized tax positions and related interest was million  of which million would result in cash payments 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the liability in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of the positions 
our transactions with recourse are related to lease financing options  which we have historically offered to our customers through a third party lessor 
this program was terminated by mutual agreement among the parties in late  however  balances outstanding as of the termination date continue to be collected by the third party lessors as they become due 
during the terms of these financing arrangements  which were generally for three years  we may remain liable for a portion of the unpaid principal balance in the event of a default on the lease by the end user  but our liability is limited in the aggregate based on a percentage of initial amounts funded or  in certain cases  amounts of unpaid balances 
at december   our maximum exposure under these programs was approximately million 
we have three letters of credit at a bank that are used as security deposits in connection with our leased burlington  massachusetts headquarters office space 
in the event of default on the underlying leases  the landlords would  at december   be eligible to draw against the letters of credit to a maximum of approximately million in the aggregate 
the letters of credit are subject to aggregate reductions of approximately million at the end of each of the second  third and fifth years  provided that we are not in default of the underlying leases and meet certain financial performance conditions 
in no case will the letters of credit amounts be reduced to below million in the aggregate throughout the lease periods  all of which extend to may at december   we were not in default of any of the underlying leases 
we also have a stand by letter of credit at a bank that is used as a security deposit in connection with our daly city  california office space lease 
in the event of a default on this lease  the landlord would be eligible to draw against this letter of credit to a maximum  at december   of million 
the letter of credit will remain in effect at this amount throughout the remaining lease period  which runs through september at december   we were not in default of this lease 
in addition  we have letters of credit totaling approximately million that support our ongoing operations 
these letters of credit have various terms and expire during and some of the letters of credit may automatically renew based on the terms of the underlying agreements 
we operate our business globally and  consequently  our results from operations are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into forward exchange contracts  which generally have one month maturities  to reduce exposures associated with the foreign exchange risks of certain forecasted third party and intercompany receivables  payables and cash balances 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional value of million  denominated in the euro  british pound  japanese yen  canadian dollar  singapore dollar and danish kroner  as a hedge against forecasted foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances

if  after assessing the totality of such events or circumstances  an entity determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the entity will be required to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test will not be required

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we have significant international operations and  therefore  our revenues  earnings  cash flows and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables  payables  sales transactions and net investments in foreign operations 
we derive more than half of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risks that changes in foreign currency could adversely affect our revenues  net income and cash flow 
we may use derivatives in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to manage certain short term exposures to fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates that exist as part of our ongoing international business operations 
we do not enter into any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the success of our hedging programs depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies and contract rates versus financial statement rates 
to the extent these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
as required by fasb asc topic  derivatives and hedging  we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative  whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting  and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting 
derivatives designated and qualifying as hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives designated and qualifying as hedges of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation 
hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge 
we may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risks  even though we elect not to apply hedge accounting under asc topic from time to time  we may execute foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange currency risk associated with certain forecasted euro denominated sales transactions 
these contracts are designated and intended to qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria of asc topic the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity and subsequently reclassified into revenues at the time the hedged transactions affect earnings 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recognized directly into earnings 
to date  no amounts have been recorded as a result of hedging ineffectiveness 
during the year ended december   we did not execute foreign currency forward contracts as a hedge against forecasted euro denominated sales transactions  and we did not have any such contracts outstanding at either december  or for the year ended december   net losses of million resulting from such forward contracts were included in our revenues 
in an effort to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances  we enter into short term foreign currency forward contracts 
there are two objectives of this foreign currency forward contract program to offset any foreign exchange currency risk associated with cash receipts expected to be received from our customers and cash payments expected to be made to our vendors over the next day period and to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange on our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity 
these forward contracts typically mature within days of execution 
we record gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on these contracts in results of operations  offsetting gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional value of million  denominated in the euro  british pound  japanese yen  canadian dollar  singapore dollar and danish kroner  as a hedge against actual and forecasted foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances 
at december   the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts was million  representing a net unrealized loss consisting of a net unrealized loss of million from contracts that matured on  but were unsettled at  december   and an immaterial mark to market net unrealized gain from contracts with maturity dates after december  for the year ended december   net losses of million resulting from forward contracts and million of net transaction and remeasurement gains on the related assets and liabilities were included in our marketing and selling expenses 
as it relates to our use of foreign currency forward contracts  a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows  assuming the above mentioned forecasts of foreign currency exposure are accurate  because the impact on the forward contracts as a result of a change would at least partially offset the impact on the revenues and asset and liability positions of our foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk at december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents 
due to the short maturities on any instruments held  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in  we established revolving credit facilities that allow us to borrow up to million 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates paid on outstanding borrowings under the credit line would not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
