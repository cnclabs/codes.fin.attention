item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive level overview carbo ceramics inc generates revenue primarily through the sale of products and services to the oil and gas industry 
the company s principal business consists of manufacturing and selling ceramic proppant and resin coated sand for use primarily in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells 
the company also provides the industry s most popular hydraulic fracture simulation software fracpro  as well as hydraulic fracture design  consulting and geotechnical monitoring services 
in october  falcon technologies  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  purchased substantially all of the assets of bbl falcon industries  ltd  a supplier of spill prevention  containment and countermeasure systems for the oil and gas industry 
the acquisition was made for the purpose of expanding the company s product and service offerings to its existing client base 
falcon technologies uses proprietary technology to provide products that are designed to enable its clients to extend the life of their storage assets  reduce the potential for hydrocarbon spills and provide containment of stored materials 
during  the company began production of resin coated ceramic carbobond lite and resin coated sand carbobond rcs proppants 
the introduction of carbobond lite addresses a market in which oil and natural gas wells are subject to a high risk of proppant flow back 
the adhesive property of the resin allows the ceramic proppant pack to adhere in place and therefore reduce the risk of proppant flow back 
in the case of carbobond rcs  the company made the strategic decision to offer a lower cost  lower conductivity alternative to its ceramic proppants thereby broadening its proppant suite of products 
management of the company believes that this is a natural extension of our core business and enhances our highly conductive proppant offering 
the company s products and services help oil and gas producers increase production and recovery rates from their wells  thereby lowering overall reservoir development costs 
as a result  the company s business is dependent to a large extent on the level of drilling activity in the oil and gas industry worldwide 
although the company s ceramic proppants are more expensive than alternative non ceramic proppants  the company has been able to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of its products to numerous operators of oil and gas wells through increased technical marketing activity 
the company believes its future prospects benefit from both an increase in drilling activity worldwide and the desire of industry participants to improve production results and lower their overall development costs 
the company believes international sales will continue to represent an important role in its business 
international revenues represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
management believes the addition of new manufacturing capacity is critical to the company s ability to continue its long term growth in sales volume and revenue for ceramic proppant  resin coated ceramic proppant and resin coated sand 
in regards to expansion  the company has recently completed the construction of a fourth production line at its toomsboro facility which increases ceramic proppant production capacity by million pounds annually and brings the company s total ceramic proppant stated capacity to billion pounds per year 
with respect to resin coating capacity expansion  the second production line in new iberia  louisiana was completed during the first quarter of and a million pound per year resin coating facility is under construction in marshfield  wisconsin 
raw sand processing facilities at this location are expected to be completed during the first half of  and resin coating facilities are expected to be completed near the end of additionally  the company has purchased a site and submitted environment permit applications for a new plant in the millen  georgia area 
this plant is targeted with initial production capacity of up to million pounds of ceramic proppant annually and a manufacturing line that represents a portion of this initial capacity could commence production before the end of although the company has operated near or at full capacity at times during the previous ten years  the addition of significant new capacity  as well as the addition of resin coating capacity  could adversely impact operating profit margins if the timing of this new capacity does not 
table of contents match increases in demand for the company s products 
in addition  the ability to construct new capacity will be contingent upon the receipt of all needed environmental emission permits 
see item business and item a risk factors operating profit margin for the company s ceramic proppant business is principally impacted by manufacturing costs  sales price and the company s production levels as a percentage of its capacity 
although most direct production expenses have been relatively stable or predictable over time  the company has experienced volatility in the cost of natural gas  which is used in production by the company s domestic manufacturing facilities  and bauxite  which is the primary raw material for production of the company s high strength ceramic proppant 
the cost of natural gas has been a significant component of total monthly domestic direct production expense over the last four years 
in an effort to mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas purchases and reduce exposure to short term spikes in the price of this commodity  the company contracts in advance for portions of its future natural gas requirements 
despite the efforts to reduce exposure to changes in natural gas prices  it is possible that  given the significant portion of manufacturing costs represented by this item  gross margins as a percentage of sales may decline and changes in net income may not directly correlate to changes in revenue 
with regard to resin coating and sand operations  the company recently completed a second resin coating line at its new iberia  louisiana facility and is adding additional resin coating capacity as well as raw sand processing facilities in marshfield  wisconsin 
the company also continues to work towards purchasing and developing its own northern white sand reserves 
the production of resin coated sand is a different process than the manufacture of ceramic proppant  and profit margins associated with resin coated sand are not anticipated to be as high as those historically received for the company s manufactured ceramic proppant 
as the company has expanded its operations in both domestic and international markets  there has been an increase in activities and expenses related to marketing  distribution  research and development  and finance and administration 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses have increased in recent years 
in the future  the company expects to continue to actively pursue new business opportunities by increasing marketing activities globally  improving and expanding its distribution capabilities  and focusing on new product development 
the company expects that these activities will generate increased revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses  however  may continue to increase in from levels as the company continues to expand its operations 
general business conditions the company s proppant business is impacted by the number of natural gas and oil wells drilled in north america  and the need to hydraulically fracture these wells 
in markets outside north america  sales of the company s products are also influenced by the overall level of drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity 
furthermore  because the decision to use ceramic proppant is based on comparing the higher initial costs to the future value derived from increased production and recovery rates  the company s business is influenced by the current and expected prices of natural gas and oil 
worldwide oil and natural gas prices and related drilling activity levels remained very strong from until the second half of during the second half of  oil and natural gas prices as well as active drilling rigs in north america declined significantly in connection with declines in many of the world s economies 
during the second half of  the north american drilling rig count improved and stabilized during late in  a severe decline in natural gas prices led certain customers to reduce drilling activities and capital 
table of contents spending in natural gas basins and increase these items in liquids rich basins 
as a result  the company experienced a reduction in sales volumes in natural gas fields  including certain shale plays 
however  this reduction was offset in part by increased sales volumes in liquids rich areas 
the company remains cautious with respect to the near term outlook for natural gas  given the current situation 
while natural gas fundamentals recently weakened  the continued strength in oilfield activity by the company s clients in oily  liquids rich plays is encouraging and the company expects demand for ceramic proppant to remain strong during since many of these liquids rich plays are located in areas of the country that do not have well developed infrastructure systems  the company and others in the industry experienced distribution challenges late in while the company believes these distribution issues will improve during the first half of  they may continue to be a factor in future operations 
overall  the company believes its operating results for will continue to be influenced by the level of oil and natural gas drilling in north america  but expects its ability to demonstrate the value of ceramic proppant relative to alternatives will allow it to continue to generate new sales opportunities  especially in oily  liquids rich plays 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer generally upon delivery of products or at the time services are performed 
the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
in addition  the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to two major customers  both of which are in the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
as of december   approximately of the balance in trade accounts receivable was attributable to those two customers 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of collectability risk and periodically evaluates the allowance based on a review of trade accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are periodically reviewed for collectability based on customers past credit history and current financial condition  and the allowance is adjusted  if necessary 
if a prolonged economic downturn in the petroleum pressure pumping industry were to occur or  for some other reason  any of the company s primary customers were to experience significant adverse conditions  the company s estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be reduced by a material amount and the allowance for doubtful accounts could be increased by a material amount 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million 
the company values inventory using the weighted average cost method 
assessing the ultimate realization of inventories requires judgments about future demand and market conditions 
the company regularly reviews inventories to determine if the carrying value of the inventory exceeds market value and the company records an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to market value  as necessary 
future changes in demand and market conditions could cause the company to be exposed to additional obsolescence or slow moving inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  lower of cost or market adjustments may be required 
income taxes are provided for in accordance with asc topic  income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires the company to make certain estimates about its future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in the company s financial condition  could affect these estimates 

table of contents long lived assets  which include net property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangibles and other long term assets  comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying values of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period

the company believes its operating results for will continue to be influenced by the level of oil and natural gas drilling in north america 
a severe decline in natural gas prices in the us in late led businesses engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas to reduce drilling activity and capital spending in natural gas basins  including shale plays  and to increase capital spending towards oily  liquids rich basins 
from the company s perspective  the industry s response to the reallocation of proppant supply and demand and adjustments to the increased supply and decreased prices for natural gas will take some time to work out  and the exact timing of this response is not certain 
see general business conditions above 
while natural gas prices remain low  the continuing shift in oilfield activity by the company s clients to oily  liquids rich plays is encouraging  and the company believes that demand for high conductivity ceramic proppant will continue to increase 
the company expects to support demand increases with additions to its production capacity 
the recently completed fourth production line at its toomsboro  georgia facility increases ceramic proppant production capacity by million pounds annually and brings the company s total ceramic proppant capacity to billion pounds per year 
with respect to resin coating capacity expansion  the second production line in new iberia  louisiana was completed during the first quarter of and increased the company s annual resin coating capacity to million pounds 
a million pound per year resin coating facility is under construction in marshfield  wisconsin 
raw sand processing facilities at this location are expected to be completed during the first half of  and resin coating facilities are expected to be completed near the end of additionally  the company has completed the due diligence process for a new ceramic proppant manufacturing site and has moved forward with the purchase of a site in georgia 
this plant is targeted with initial production capacity of up to million pounds annually and a manufacturing line that represents a portion of this initial capacity could commence production before the end of additionally  during periods of high demand and typically at the request of its customers  the company may also continue to engage in the sale of ceramic proppant that meets api iso standards manufactured on an outsourced basis
