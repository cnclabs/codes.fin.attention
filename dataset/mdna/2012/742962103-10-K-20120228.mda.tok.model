source of strength 
under a longstanding policy of the frb  a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its banking subsidiaries and to commit resources to support them 
the frb takes the position that in implementing this policy  it may require a bank holding company to provide financial support to its subsidiaries at times it deems appropriate 
acquisitions and activities 
the bhc act requires prior frb approval for  among other things  the acquisition by a bank holding company of direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank  or for a merger or consolidation of a bank holding company with another bank holding company 
with limited exceptions  the bhc act prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in any activity other than banking or managing or controlling banks or performing services for its authorized subsidiaries 
a bank holding company may  however  engage in or acquire an interest in a company that engages in activities that the frb has determined  by regulation or order  to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto  such as owning and operating a savings association  performing functions or activities that may be performed by a trust company  owning a mortgage company  or acting as an investment or financial advisor 
the frb  as a matter of policy  may require a bank holding company to be well capitalized at the time of filing an acquisition application and upon consummation of the acquisition 

table of contents the gramm leach bliley act allows bank holding companies that are in compliance with certain requirements to elect to become financial holding companies 
financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of activities than is otherwise permitted for bank holding companies 
at this time  privatebancorp has not elected to become a financial holding company 
redemptions 
under the bhc act  bank holding companies are required to provide the frb with prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of their outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption  when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months is equal to or more of their consolidated net worth 
the frb may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law  regulation  frb order  or any condition imposed by or written agreement with the frb 
this prior notice requirement does not apply to any bank holding company that meets certain well capitalized and well managed standards and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues 
under provisions of the treasury s capital purchase program cpp as more fully discussed below under emergency economic stabilization act  bank holding companies which sold equity securities to the treasury under the cpp are generally prohibited  provided that such securities remain outstanding  from acquiring or redeeming their common  preferred or trust preferred securities for three years  without the consent of the treasury 
pursuant to our participation in the cpp  as discussed below  our ability to repurchase equity securities without prior treasury approval was restricted until january  this cpp restriction on stock repurchases is no longer applicable to the company  however  the company continues to be subject to the limitation on stock repurchases described in the preceding paragraph 
tie in arrangements 
under the bhc act and frb regulations  we are prohibited from engaging in tie in arrangements in connection with an extension of credit  lease  or sale of property or furnishing of services 
accordingly  we may not condition a client s purchase of one of our services on the purchase of another service  except with respect to traditional banking products 
interstate banking and branching legislation 
under the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate banking act  bank holding companies that are well capitalized and managed are allowed to acquire banks across state lines subject to certain limitations 
states may prohibit interstate acquisitions of banks that have not been in existence for at least five years 
the frb is prohibited from approving an application for acquisition if the applicant controls more than of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide 
in addition  interstate acquisitions may also be subject to statewide concentration limits 
furthermore  under the interstate banking act  banks are permitted  under some circumstances  to merge with one another across state lines and thereby create a main bank with branches in separate states 
approval of interstate bank mergers is subject to certain conditions  including well capitalized and well managed standards  cra compliance and deposit concentration limits  compliance with federal and state antitrust laws and compliance with applicable state consumer protection laws 
after establishing branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction  a bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where any bank involved in the interstate merger could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal and state law 
in addition  the interstate banking act  as amended by the dodd frank act  also now permits a bank  with the approval of the appropriate federal and state bank regulatory agencies  to establish a de novo branch in a state other than the bank s home state if the law of the state in which the branch is to be located would permit establishment of the branch if the out of state bank were a state bank chartered by such state 
ownership limitations 
under the federal change in bank control act  a person may be required to obtain the prior regulatory approval of the frb before acquiring the power to directly or indirectly control the management  operations or policies of privatebancorp or before acquiring control of or more of any class of our outstanding voting stock 
under the illinois banking act  any acquisition of privatebancorp stock that results in a change in control may require prior approval of the illinois department of financial and professional regulation 
dividends 
the frb has issued an updated policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies 
in the policy statement  the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company should inform the frb and should eliminate  defer or severely limit the payment of dividends if i the bank holding company s net income for the past four quarters is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends  ii the bank holding company s prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition  or iii the bank holding company will not meet  or is in danger of not meeting  its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios 
the policy statement also provides that the frb should be informed in advance prior to declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period eg  quarter for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the organization s capital structure 
additionally  the frb possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations 
among these powers is the ability to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends 
we provide notice to and obtain approval from the frb before declaring or paying any dividends 

table of contents in addition to the restrictions on dividends imposed by the frb  delaware law also places limitations on the ability of a corporation to pay dividends 
corporations may only pay dividends out of surplus or net profits in accordance with delaware law 
the ability of a holding company to pay dividends may also depend on the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries 
during  and  we did not receive any dividends from our banking subsidiaries and we were dependent upon the capital maintained at the holding company level to pay dividends 
bank regulation our subsidiary bank  the bank  is subject to extensive supervision and regulation by various federal and state authorities 
additionally  as an affiliate of the bank  privatebancorp is also subject  to some extent  to regulation by the bank s supervisory and regulatory authorities 
the bank is an illinois state chartered bank and as such  is subject to supervision and examination by the illinois department of financial and professional regulation and  as a frb non member bank  its primary federal regulator  the fdic 
regulatory approvals and enforcement 
federal and state laws require banks to seek approval by the appropriate federal or state banking agency or agencies for any merger and or consolidation by or with another depository institution  as well as for the establishment or relocation of any bank or branch office and  in some cases to engage in new activities or form subsidiaries 
federal and state statutes and regulations provide the appropriate bank regulatory agencies with great flexibility and powers to undertake enforcement actions against financial institutions  holding companies or persons regarded as institution affiliated parties 
possible enforcement actions range from the imposition of a capital plan and capital directive to a cease and desist order  civil money penalties  receivership  conservatorship or the termination of deposit insurance 
transactions with affiliates 
federal and state statutes place certain restrictions and limitations on transactions between banks and their affiliates  which include holding companies 
among other provisions  these laws place restrictions upon extensions of credit by an insured financial institution to the bank holding company and any non banking affiliates  the purchase by an insured financial institution of assets from affiliates  the issuance by an insured financial institution of guarantees  acceptances or letters of credit on behalf of affiliates  and investments by an insured financial institution in stock or other securities issued by affiliates or acceptance thereof as collateral for an extension of credit 
permissible activities  investments and other restrictions 
federal and state laws provide extensive limitations on the types of activities in which our subsidiary bank may engage and the types of investments it may make 
for example  banks are subject to restrictions with respect to engaging in securities activities  real estate development activities and insurance activities and may invest only in certain types and amounts of securities and may invest only up to certain dollar amount thresholds in their premises 
monetary policy 
the bank is affected by the credit policies of the frb  which regulate the national supply of bank credit 
such regulation influences overall growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and may also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the frb s monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and this trend is likely to continue in the future 
dividends 
federal and state laws restrict and limit the dividends the bank may pay 
under the illinois banking act  the bank  while continuing to operate a banking business  may not pay dividends of an amount greater than its current net profits after deducting losses and bad debts 
for the purpose of determining the amount of dividends that an illinois bank may pay  bad debts are defined as debts upon which interest is past due and unpaid for a period of six months or more unless such debts are well secured and in the process of collection 
in addition to the foregoing  the ability of our subsidiary bank to pay dividends may be affected by the various minimum capital requirements and the capital and non capital standards established under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvements act of fdicia  as described below 
reserve requirements 
our subsidiary bank is subject to frb regulations requiring depository institutions to maintain non interest earning reserves against its transaction accounts 
for net transaction accounts in  the first million of a bank s transaction accounts subject to adjustments by the frb are exempt from the reserve requirements 
the frb regulations generally require 
table of contents reserves on a bank s transaction accounts totaling between million and million 
for transaction accounts totaling over million  frb regulations require reserves of million plus of the amount over million 
cross guaranty 
under the federal deposit insurance act fdi act  an insured institution that is commonly controlled with another insured institution shall generally be liable for losses incurred  or reasonably anticipated to be incurred  by the fdic in connection with the default of such commonly controlled insured institution  or for any assistance provided by the fdic to such commonly controlled institution  which is in danger of default 
standards for safety and soundness 
the fdi act  as amended by fdicia and the riegle community development and regulatory improvement act of  requires the fdic  together with the other federal bank regulatory agencies  to prescribe standards of safety and soundness  by regulations or guidelines  relating generally to operations and management  asset growth  asset quality  earnings  stock valuation and compensation 
the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted a set of guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards pursuant to fdicia 
the guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  and compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer  employee  director or principal stockholder 
in addition  the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted regulations that authorize  but do not require  the agencies to order an institution that has been given notice that it is not satisfying the safety and soundness guidelines to submit a compliance plan 
if  after being so notified  an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan  the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
if an institution fails to comply with such an order  the agency may seek to enforce its order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 
the federal bank regulatory agencies have also adopted guidelines for asset quality and earning standards 
state chartered banks may also be subject to state statutes  regulations and guidelines relating to safety and soundness  in addition the federal requirements 
capital requirements and prompt corrective action 
fdicia defines five capital levels well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
fdicia requires the federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that fall below minimum capital standards and prohibits any depository institution from making any capital distribution that would cause it to be undercapitalized 
institutions that are not adequately capitalized may be subject to a variety of supervisory actions  including restrictions on growth  investment activities  capital distributions and affiliate transactions  and will be required to submit a capital restoration plan which  to be accepted by the regulators  must be guaranteed in part by any company having control of the institution for example  the company or a stockholder controlling the company 
in other respects  fdicia provides for enhanced supervisory authority  including greater authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for critically undercapitalized institutions 
the capital based prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia and its implementing regulations apply to fdic insured depository institutions 
however  federal banking agencies have indicated that  in regulating bank holding companies  the agencies may take appropriate action at the holding company level based on their assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary insured depository institutions pursuant to the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
state chartered banks may also be subject to similar supervisory actions by their respective state banking agencies 
insurance of deposit accounts 
under fdicia  as a fdic insured institution  the bank is required to pay deposit insurance premiums based on the risk it poses to the deposit insurance fund dif 
the fdic has authority to raise or lower assessment rates on insured deposits in order to achieve required ratios in the insurance fund and to impose special additional assessments 
to determine an institution s assessment rate  each insured institution is placed in a risk category using a two step process based on capital and supervisory information 
each insured institution is assigned to one of the following three capital groups well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized 
each insured institution is then assigned one of three supervisory ratings a institutions with few minor weaknesses  b institutions which demonstrate weaknesses which  if not corrected  could result in significant deterioration of the institution and increased risk of loss to dif or c institutions that pose a substantial probability of loss to dif unless effective corrective action is taken 
insured institutions classified as strongest by the fdic are subject to the lowest insurance rate  insured institutions classified as weakest by the fdic are subject to the highest insurance assessment rate 
in october  the fdic published a restoration plan to reestablish the dif to the statutory required minimum percentage of deposits  and has amended the plan from time to time thereafter 
as part of the restoration plan  the fdic increased risk based assessment rates 
in november  the fdic approved a final rule that required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and the prepaid assessments were 
table of contents recorded as a prepaid expense against which future quarterly assessments are applied 
in we paid million in deposit insurance prepayments through depending on our performance  any growth and other factors  this prepayment may be more or less than the aggregate insurance assessments through in february  the fdic approved final rules amending the deposit insurance assessment regulations 
the rules implement a provision in the dodd frank act that broadens the assessment base from one based on domestic deposits to one based on total assets less average tangible equity 
in addition to broadening the assessment base  the rules establish a separate risk based assessment system for large institutions with more than billion in assets and for other large  highly complex institutions 
prior to the rules taking effect  the rate for insured institutions are assessed based primarily on capital and supervisory information  including examination ratings and certain other factors as described above 
the rules eliminate the existing risk categories for large institutions and make the assessment rate a function of examination ratings  a performance component  which is designed to assess the institution s financial performance and ability to withstand stress  a loss severity component  which is designed to assess the level of potential loss in a failure scenario  and other factors and considerations 
under the rules  large institutions are subject to different minimum and maximum total assessment rate ranges 
the ranges are subject to certain adjustments by the fdic without further rulemaking 
the fdic intends for the new large bank pricing system to result in higher assessments for banks with high risk asset concentrations  less stable balance sheet liquidity  or potentially higher loss severity in the event of failure 
the rules took effect april  and impacted assessments in the second quarter of pursuant to the emergency economic stabilization act and the american recovery and reinvestment act of each as described more fully below  the maximum deposit insurance on qualifying accounts was increased from  to  until december  the dodd frank act permanently increased the maximum deposit insurance on qualifying accounts to  deposit insurance may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
such terminations can only occur  if contested  following judicial review through the federal courts 
we do not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance for the bank 
the dodd frank act also raised the minimum reserve ratio of the dif from to of estimated insured deposits  which ratio is required to be attained by september   eliminated the size limit of the dif  and directed the fdic to issue a rule establishing a new designated reserve ratio 
pursuant to this directive  the fdic recently issued a rule setting a designated reserve ratio at of insured deposits 
these policies may result in increased assessments on certain institutions with more than billion in assets 
see the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act below for additional information regarding the dodd frank act 
community reinvestment 
under the community reinvestment act cra  a financial institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions  or limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community 
however  institutions are rated on their performance in meeting the needs of their communities 
performance is tested in three areas a lending  to evaluate the institution s lending performance  particularly to low and moderate income individuals and neighborhoods and small businesses in its assessment areas  b investment  to evaluate the institution s record of investing in community development projects  affordable housing  and programs benefiting low income or moderate income individuals and small businesses  and c service  to evaluate the institution s delivery of products and services through its branches  and automated teller machines as well as its service to the community 
the cra requires each federal banking agency  in connection with its examination of a financial institution  to assess and assign one of four ratings to the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the institution  including applications for charters  branches and other deposit facilities  relocations  mergers  consolidations  acquisitions of assets or assumptions of liabilities  and savings and loan holding company acquisitions 
the cra also requires that all institutions make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
the bank was assigned a satisfactory rating at its most recent cra examinations 
anti money laundering ofac sanctions programs 
the bank secrecy act bsa  as amended by the usa patriot act of  imposes significant obligations on financial institutions to detect and deter money laundering and terrorist financing 
financial institutions are required to establish programs designed to implement bsa requirements that include verifying customer identification  reporting certain large cash transactions  responding to requests for information by law enforcement agencies  and monitoring  investigating and reporting suspicious transactions or activity 
the treasury s office of foreign assets control ofac enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against entities such as targeted foreign countries  terrorists  international narcotics traffickers  and those engaged in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
we are subject to these rules and have implemented policies  procedures and controls to comply with the anti money laundering regulations and the ofac sanctions programs 

table of contents compliance with consumer protection laws 
our bank is subject to many state and federal statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers  such as  cra  the truth in lending act regulation z  the truth in savings act regulation dd  the equal credit opportunity act regulation b  the fair housing act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the home mortgage disclosure act regulation c and the fair and accurate credit transactions act 
among other things  these statutes and regulations require lenders to disclose credit terms in meaningful and consistent ways  prohibit discrimination against an applicant in any consumer or business credit transaction  prohibit discrimination in housing related lending activities  require certain lenders to collect and report applicant and borrower data regarding loans for home purchases or improvement projects  require lenders to provide borrowers with information regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements  prohibit certain lending practices and limit escrow account amounts with respect to real estate transactions  require financial institutions to implement identity theft prevention programs and measures to protect the confidentiality of consumer financial information  and prescribe possible penalties for violations of the requirements of consumer protection statutes and regulations 
as a result of the dodd frank act  the newly established consumer financial protection bureau the bureau now has authority for amending existing federal consumer compliance regulations and implementing new such regulations 
in addition  the bureau has responsibility for examining the compliance of financial institutions with assets in excess of billion  such as the bank  with these consumer protection rules 
real estate lending concentrations 
the fdic  frb and the office of the comptroller of the currency have issued guidance on concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
the guidance reinforces and enhances existing regulations and guidelines for safe and sound real estate lending 
the guidance provides supervisory criteria  including numerical indicators to assist in identifying institutions with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny 
the guidance focuses on institutions properly identifying whether they have a commercial real estate concentration and  if so  instituting the appropriate risk management procedures and increasing capital so that it is commensurate with the risk of having such a concentration 
allowance for loan and lease losses 
in december  the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interagency policy statement revising their previous policy on the allowance for loan and lease losses alll  which was issued in the policy statement was updated to ensure consistency with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and post supervisory guidance 
according to the revised policy statement  the alll represents one of the most significant estimates in an institution s financial statements and regulatory reports 
because of its significance  each institution has a responsibility for developing  maintaining and documenting a comprehensive  systematic  and consistently applied process appropriate to its size and the nature  scope  and risk of its lending activities for determining the amounts of the alll and the provision for loan and lease losses 
the policy statement provides that to fulfill this responsibility  each institution should ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the alll in accordance with us gaap  the institution s stated policies and procedures  management s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance 
consistent with long standing supervisory guidance  the policy states that institutions must maintain an alll at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio 
estimates of credit losses should reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectability of loans in the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
arriving at an appropriate allowance involves a high degree of management judgment and results in a range of estimated losses 
emergency economic stabilization act on october   the us congress enacted the emergency economic stabilization act eesa 
eesa authorized the secretary of the treasury to purchase up to billion in troubled assets from qualifying financial institutions pursuant to the tarp 
on october   the treasury  pursuant to its authority under eesa  announced the cpp 
pursuant to the cpp  qualifying public financial institutions could issue senior preferred stock to the treasury in an amount not less than of risk weighted assets and not more than of risk weighted assets or billion  whichever is less 
the proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock are included in the financial institution s tier capital 
the senior preferred stock pays a dividend per annum until the fifth year of the investment and per annum thereafter 
in addition to the senior preferred stock  participating public financial institutions must issue a warrant to the treasury for the purchase of common stock in an amount equal to of the preferred stock investment 
the treasury will not exercise any voting rights with respect to the common shares acquired through the exercise of the warrants 
financial institutions participating in the cpp must agree and comply with certain restrictions  including restrictions on redemption  
table of contents dividends  repurchases and executive compensation  as discussed below 
finally  the treasury may unilaterally amend any provision of the cpp to comply with changes in applicable federal statutes 
redemption 
the terms of the cpp contained restrictions on the redemption of the treasury s preferred stock investment 
these restrictions on redemptions were modified on february   in connection with enactment of the american recovery and reinvestment act of the recovery act discussed below 
dividends 
prior to the third anniversary of the investment or the date on which the treasury s senior preferred stock investment has been fully redeemed or transferred  the financial institution may not increase common dividends beyond certain levels without the treasury s consent 
as noted above  as of january   the foregoing restriction is no longer applicable to privatebancorp 
in addition  the financial institution may not pay dividends on common stock unless the financial institution has paid dividends on the preferred stock 
if the financial institution does not pay dividends on the senior preferred stock for six dividend periods  the treasury will have the right to elect two members to the board of directors 
repurchases 
prior to the third anniversary of the investment or the date on which the treasury s senior preferred stock investment has been fully redeemed or transferred  the financial institution may not repurchase other equity securities or trust preferred securities without the treasury s consent  except repurchases in the ordinary course related to employee benefit plans in a manner consistent with past practice  certain market making and related transactions by a broker dealer subsidiary of the financial institution  certain custodian or trustee transactions for another beneficial owner  or certain agreements pre dating participation in the cpp 
as noted above  as of january   the foregoing restriction is no longer applicable to privatebancorp 
executive compensation 
participating financial institutions must modify certain senior executive compensation agreements consistent with eesa  which generally prohibits incentive compensation agreements that encourage senior executive officers to take unnecessary and excessive risks 
in addition  incentive compensation paid to senior executive officers must be recovered if such payments are subsequently determined to be based upon materially inaccurate financial results ie  a clawback provision 
participating financial institutions are prohibited from making golden parachute payments to senior executive officers and are required to limit the federal tax deduction for compensation paid to senior executive officers to  for this purpose  senior executive officer means an individual who is one of the executives whose compensation is required to be disclosed pursuant to the exchange act 
as discussed below  these executive compensation restrictions were further expanded by the recovery act 
on january   privatebancorp closed a transaction with the treasury in order to participate in the cpp 
privatebancorp issued preferred stock to the treasury equal to million and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of 
as a result of the completion of two qualified equity offerings in  pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds in excess of million  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant was reduced by from  to  shares 
pursuant to its participation in the cpp  privatebancorp is subject to the provisions therein 
american recovery and reinvestment act of on february   the recovery act was signed into law 
included among the many provisions of the recovery act are restrictions affecting financial institutions who are participants in the tarp  which are set forth in the form of amendments to the eesa 
these amendments provide that during the period in which any obligation under the tarp remains outstanding other than obligations relating to outstanding warrants  tarp recipients are subject to appropriate standards for executive compensation and corporate governance which were set forth in an interim final rule regarding tarp standards for compensation and corporate governance  issued by the treasury and effective on june  interim final rule

table of contents a requirement that the company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer provide in annual securities filings  a written certification of compliance with the executive compensation and corporate governance provisions of the interim final rule  an obligation for the compensation committee of the board of directors to evaluate with the company s chief risk officer certain compensation plans to ensure that such plans do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risks or the manipulation of reported earnings  a requirement that companies adopt a company wide policy regarding excessive or luxury expenditures  a requirement that companies permit a separate  non binding shareholder vote to approve the compensation of executives  and a provision that allows the treasury to review compensation paid prior to enactment of the recovery act to senior executive officers and the next most highly compensated employees to determine whether any payments were inconsistent with the executive compensation restrictions of the eesa  as amended  tarp or otherwise contrary to the public interest 
in addition  companies who have issued preferred stock to the treasury under tarp are now permitted to redeem such investments at any time  subject to consultation with banking regulators 
upon such redemption  the warrants may be immediately liquidated by the treasury 
fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program in october  the fdic announced the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system 
the program was comprised of two voluntary components the transaction account guarantee program tagp and the debt guarantee program dgp 
transaction account guarantee program 
pursuant to the tagp  the fdic fully insured  without limit  qualifying transaction accounts held at qualifying depository institutions through december  qualifying transaction accounts included non interest bearing transaction accounts  interest on lawyers trust accounts ioltas and negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts with interest rates less than 
the fdic assessed a fee equal to basis points on transaction account deposit balances in excess of the  insured limit  which was subsequently increased to to basis points depending upon an institution s deposit insurance assessment risk category 
as provided by the dodd frank act  as discussed below  the fdic will insure the full balance of non interest bearing transaction accounts  including ioltas but not now accounts  through december   replacing the tagp at the end of beginning on january   non interest bearing transaction accounts will be insured under the fdic s general deposit insurance coverage rules 
debt guarantee program 
pursuant to the dgp  eligible entities were permitted to issue fdic guaranteed senior unsecured debt in an amount up to of the entity s senior unsecured debt outstanding as of september  privatebancorp has not issued any guaranteed debt under the dgp 
dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank act which has already significantly changed the financial regulatory landscape and will continue to affect the operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies  as well as others 
although many of the details of the dodd frank act  and the full impact it will have on financial institutions and their holding companies  are uncertain at this point  in part because many of the provisions require the adoption of implementing rules and regulations  changes mandated by the dodd frank act and the expected burden of compliance with the new law and its rules and regulations could increase operating costs and reduce revenues of financial institutions and their holding companies 
in addition to the dodd frank act provisions discussed above  the dodd frank act also includes provisions that  among other things direct the federal bank regulatory agencies to review and propose new capital requirements applicable to banking institutions such new capital standards applicable to the bank have not yet been established by the regulatory agencies 
the regulations are required to be  at a minimum  as stringent as current capital and leverage requirements and may limit the use of subordinated debt or similar instruments to meet capital requirements 
provide that any trust preferred securities and certain hybrid securities issued on or after may  will be considered tier and not tier capital 
any trust preferred securities issued prior to may  by banks with assets of less than billion as of december  will continue to qualify as tier capital 
any trust preferred securities issued prior to may  by banks with assets greater than billion as of december  will continue to qualify as tier capital until january  at that time  the treatment of the trust preferred securities as tier capital will be phased out over a three year period ending in january our currently outstanding trust preferred securities are grandfathered for tier eligibility 

table of contents require regulatory agencies to make capital requirements for bank holding companies countercyclical  so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction 
require financial institutions  with more than billion in assets  such as the bank  to conduct annual stress tests in accordance with regulations to be issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies 
on january   the fdic issued a proposed rule  subject to public comment the proposed rule requiring state nonmember banks and savings associations  with total consolidated assets of more than billion  to conduct three annual stress tests based on baseline  adverse and severely adverse scenarios 
the proposed rule requires each covered institution to calculate  based on specific scenarios to be developed by the fdic and provided to the covered institution  the impact on each institution s potential losses  pre provision revenues  loan loss reserves  and pro forma capital positions  including the impact on capital levels and ratios  during the specified time period 
in addition  the proposed rule requires covered institutions to disclose the results of their stress tests to the fdic and a summary of such results to the public 
the proposed rule s public comment period ends on march  increase the regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions 
the regulations are expected to impose additional reporting and monitoring requirements  require higher capital and margin requirements and require that certain trades be executed through clearinghouses 
centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency  the bureau  responsible for implementing  examining  and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws 
the bureau will have broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
among other things  it is anticipated that the bureau may consider significant reforms in the mortgage industry 
create the financial stability oversight council that will recommend to the frb increasingly strict rules for capital  leverage  liquidity  risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity 
include mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer s ability to repay and making more loans subject to restrictions applicable to higher cost loans and new disclosures 
in addition  certain compensation for mortgage brokers based on certain loan terms has been prohibited eg compensation based on yield spread premiums 
require financial institutions to make a reasonable and good faith determination that borrowers have the ability to repay loans for which they apply 
if a financial institution fails to make such a determination  a borrower can assert this failure as a defense to foreclosure

basel committee on banking supervision 
although its impact on the implementing rules and regulations of the dodd frank act remains unclear  the us federal banking agencies have expressed support for recently issued proposals by the basel committee on banking supervision  commonly referred to as basel iii  that provide for heightened bank capital  leverage and liquidity requirements that would be phased in over a multi year period 
basel iii provides for a minimum common equity risk based capital requirement  a tier risk based capital requirement  an total risk based capital requirement  an additional common equity capital conservation buffer and a periodic countercyclical capital buffer 
the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses in periods of financial and economic distress 
the countercyclical buffer would be implemented according to national circumstances 
the basel iii proposals also include a non risk based leverage ratio  as a supplement to the capital requirements  and liquidity requirements 
the extent to which regulators in the united states adopt or incorporate provisions of basel iii in future legislation  including the implementing rules and regulations of the dodd frank act  remains unclear

item a 
risk factors our business  financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks  including those discussed below  which may affect the value of our securities 
the risks discussed below are those that we believe are the most significant risks affecting us and our business  although additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant may also adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  perhaps materially 
before making a decision to invest in our securities  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report 
risks related to our business our business has been  and will continue to be  affected by the stress in the commercial real estate market 
the real estate market continues to experience a variety of difficulties and challenging economic conditions 
in particular  market conditions in the chicago metropolitan area remain stressed 
if the economy generally  or the real estate market specifically  does not improve or experiences further deterioration  we could suffer losses against commercial real estate and construction loans in excess of what we have provided for in the allowance for loan losses 
since the beginning of  when our commercial real estate and construction loans totaled billion  we have recorded million in charge offs to those portions of the loan portfolio 
at december   our commercial real estate and construction loans totaled billion  and included million in special mention and potential problem loans  and million in non performing loans 
at december   we allocated million in general reserves and million in specific reserves to the commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios 
our commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios include loans with large principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful leasing or sale of the property  the successful operation of the business occupying the property  the cost and time frame of constructing or improving a property and the availability of permanent financing 
the repayment of these loans is particularly influenced by general conditions in the real estate markets or in the local economy where the property is located 
many commercial real estate and construction loans do not fully amortize the balance over the loan period  but have balloon payments due at maturity 
the borrower s ability to make a balloon payment may depend on their ability to either refinance the loan or complete a timely sale of the underlying property 
the borrower s inability to use funds generated by a project to service a loan until a project is completed  and the more pronounced risk to interest rate movements and the real estate market that these borrowers face while a project is being completed or seeking a buyer  can also make construction loans more vulnerable to risk of default 
on a non owner occupied commercial property  if the cash flow from a borrower s project is reduced due to leases not being obtained or renewed  that borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
we depend on a liquid market in order to sell property that we acquire through foreclosure oreo in a cost effective and timely manner 
if the real estate market continues to experience difficulties and challenging economic conditions  we may have difficulty selling foreclosed property at values we consider reasonable  particularly land  which may result in increased losses and carrying costs 
at december   oreo totaled million 
our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans  many of which include larger credit relationships  and the repayment of which is largely dependent upon the financial success and viability of the borrower and the state of the economy 
our loan portfolio is significantly comprised of commercial and industrial loans  many of which involve larger credit relationships that expose us to significant concentration of credit risk 
at december  and consistent with  we had unique obligors with credit commitments of million or more totaling billion 
over of such commitments at december  are secured by collateral 
of this total commitment  billion  or of our loan portfolio  has been used 
the 
table of contents remaining billion relates to unused or partially drawn commitments 
approximately of these large obligors are commercial and industrial businesses  the remaining exposure is related to commercial real estate loans 
of our largest commitments  five individual obligors had commitments of million or more at december   totaling million of which million has been drawn  compared to million at december  of which million was drawn 
depending on collateral values  success of a workout strategy or the ability of a borrower to return to performing status  the unexpected occurrence of an event or development adversely impacting one or more of our large clients could materially affect our results of operation and financial condition 
the repayment of the loans in our commercial and industrial portfolio is dependent upon the financial success and viability of the borrower 
if the economy remains weak for a prolonged period or experiences further deterioration or if the industry or market in which the borrower operates weakens  our borrowers may experience depressed or dramatic and sudden decreases in revenues that could hinder their ability to repay their loans 
our commercial and industrial loan portfolio  which includes owner occupied commercial real estate  totaled billion  or of our total loan portfolio  at december   compared to billion  or of our total loan portfolio  at december  many of our commercial and industrial loans are secured by different types of collateral related to the underlying business  such as accounts receivable  inventory and equipment  which fluctuate in value 
should a commercial and industrial loan default require us to foreclose on underlying collateral  we may not recover the principal amount of the loan and the unique nature of certain collateral may make it more difficult and costly to liquidate 
within our commercial lending business  we have a specialized niche in the nursing and residential care segment of the healthcare industry 
at december   of the commercial loan portfolio or billion was composed of loans within the healthcare industry  primarily loans in which the facilities securing the loans are dependent  in part  on the receipt of payments and reimbursements under government contracts for services provided 
our clients and their ability to service debt may be adversely impacted by the health of state or federal budgets and the ability of such governments  many of which have experienced budgetary stress in the recent economic environment  to make payments for services previously provided 
as of december   of the healthcare portfolio was secured by facilities in five states  with illinois representing the highest percentage of facilities at 
our allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio 
lending money is a substantial part of our business 
every loan we make carries a certain risk of non payment 
this risk is affected by  among other things the credit risks posed by the particular borrower and loan type  changes in economic and industry conditions  the duration of the loan  in the case of a collateralized loan  the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral  and the ability to identify potential repayment issues in loans at an early stage 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents an accounting estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information at that time 
the allowance is not a prediction of our actual credit losses going forward 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships that are considered to be impaired  as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified  which is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors applied to segments of our loan portfolio and management s judgment 
the calculation of the allowance involves a great deal of judgment and uncertainty particularly given the state of the overall economy  the continuing stress in the real estate market  and negative events or circumstances that might impact an individual borrower 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not incur losses on loans greater than what we have provided for in the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   compared to million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was at december   compared to at december  our allowance as a percentage of total loans reflects a level based on management s analysis of the risk inherent in our loan portfolio 
although we believe our loan loss allowance is adequate to absorb probable and reasonably estimable losses in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date  the allowance may not be adequate especially if economic conditions worsen or the factors used to calculate the allowance change 
our regulators also review the adequacy of our allowance and although they have never done so  do have authority to compel us to increase our allowance in current or future periods 
a large portion of our loan portfolio was originated since when we initiated a strategic plan to transform the bank into a leading middle market commercial bank 
the behavior of a portfolio of more mature loans may be more predictable based on past performance history than a newer portfolio  such as ours 
in calculating the allowance  we use historical default and loss information 

table of contents for those segments of our portfolio that are less seasoned  such as our commercial and industrial portfolio  the available historical default and loss data is more limited  making it more difficult to estimate the probable losses inherent in those portfolios 
as a result  the current level of delinquencies and defaults may not be representative of the level that will occur when the newer portion of the portfolio becomes more seasoned  which may be higher than current levels 
in the event we are required to increase our allowance for loan losses  our credit losses exceed our allowance or we are required to take higher than anticipated charge offs in future periods  our earnings and our capital will be adversely affected 
we may experience variability in our quarterly loan loss provision expense and charge offs if larger credits default  which may impact credit quality trends 
we may be required to hold higher capital levels 
under applicable regulatory guidelines  we are subject to minimum capital requirements adopted and administered by the federal banking agencies 
the current economic environment and the challenges facing many financial institutions  however  have resulted in heightened capital expectations from the federal banking agencies  particularly with respect to financial institutions experiencing credit challenges in their loan portfolios 
rulemaking proposals under dodd frank act and basel iii could ultimately impose capital requirements that are more stringent than current requirements and expectations and may limit the use of subordinated debt or similar instruments to meet capital requirements 
future issuances of trust preferred securities have been disallowed as tier qualifying capital under dodd frank act  although our currently outstanding trust preferred securities have been grandfathered for tier eligibility 
the dodd frank act and basel iii also require regulatory agencies to seek to make capital requirements for bank holding companies countercyclical  so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction 
because many of the implementing rules have not yet been finalized or even proposed  there is continuing uncertainty surrounding the rulemaking and interpretations under the dodd frank act and basel iii and the level of capital that will be deemed adequate for our risk profile  as well as market expectations regarding adequate capital levels we currently manage our balance sheet to maintain capital ratios at levels above the minimum regulatory guidelines that we deem adequate for our risk profile and expect to manage growth within our existing capital base 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to maintain capital at these levels or at levels required or expected by our regulators or future laws and regulations  especially considering the uncertainty surrounding such future laws and interpretations 
our capital position may be affected by credit losses and credit deterioration  potential asset impairment  significant draws on our unfunded commitments  or unexpected asset growth 
we may be required to raise capital to maintain capital at appropriate levels 
the terms on which we are able to raise capital  such as capital costs and dilutive impact on shareholders  will be dependent upon our access to the capital markets and will be influenced by events  circumstances and risks that are specific to us and the banking industry 
the success of our business is dependent on ongoing access to sufficient and cost effective sources of liquidity 
we depend on access to a variety of funding sources to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our lending commitments and business needs and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients  including funding new loans and client draws on unused lines of credit 
as of december   we had a total of billion of unfunded commitments to extend credit 
currently  our primary sources of liquidity are client deposits  large institutional deposits  and wholesale market based borrowings  including brokered deposits 
in addition to on balance sheet liquidity and funding  we maintain access to various external sources of funding 
these external sources of funding include federal fund counterparty lines  repurchase agreements  the discount window at the federal reserve bank  federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings and the brokered deposit market 
our ability to access these external sources depends on availability in the market place and a number of factors such as counterparty relationship strength in the case of federal fund counterparty lines and repurchase agreements or the availability of loans eligible under the federal reserve s and the fhlb s criteria eg  stipulations of documentation requirements  credit quality  payment status and other criteria 
if our primary sources of liquidity are insufficient and we are unable to adequately access external sources  we may be required to increase our on balance sheet liquidity and funding by accessing the capital markets  which may not be cost effective or may have a dilutive effect on our shareholders 
since  we have experienced a significant increase in client deposits 
this has allowed us to reduce our reliance on wholesale funding sources 
however  there can be no assurance that this level of client deposit growth will continue or remain at current levels or that we will be able to maintain the lower reliance on wholesale deposits 
as returns in the equity markets improve  when the economy improves  interest rates rise or if the current eligibility for unlimited fdic insurance coverage is eliminated  some of our client deposits may move to other investment options  which may lead to increased reliance on wholesale or other funding sources 

table of contents in addition  because our deposit base is relatively concentrated given our core commercial banking strategy  the loss of large client relationships could negatively impact our liquidity 
at december   we had client relationships with greater than million in deposit balances and our ten largest depositor accounts totaled billion  or of total deposits 
we are highly dependent upon the current cash position of the holding company to meet holding company liquidity needs and to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock for the foreseeable future 
at december   the holding company had cash and liquid investments totaling million 
the loss of key managing directors may adversely affect our operations 
we are a relationship driven organization 
our growth and development during the past four years can be attributed in large part to the efforts of our managing directors who have primary contact with our clients and who are extremely important in maintaining personalized relationships with our client base  which is a key aspect of our business strategy 
the loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations if we are unable to replace these employees or we are unable to successfully retain the client relationships of a departing managing director 
to the extent weak financial performance  restrictions on compensation due to our participation in the tarp capital purchase program  limitations on available equity awards  or regulatory guidance impact our ability to offer competitive pay programs  we may not be successful in motivating and retaining key employees 
our business could be significantly impacted if we suffer failure or disruptions of our information systems 
we rely heavily on communications  data processing and other information processing systems to conduct our business and support our day to day banking  investment  and trust activities  many of which are provided through third parties 
although we take ongoing protective monitoring  detection  and prevention measures and perform penetration testing and risk assessments at least annually  our computer systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  loss or destruction of data including confidential client information  account takeovers  unavailability of service  computer viruses or other malicious code  or cyberattacks beyond what we can reasonably anticipate and such events could result in material loss 
we could suffer disruptions to our systems or damage to our network infrastructure from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  such as electrical or telecommunications outages  natural disasters  widespread health emergencies or pandemics  or events arising from local or larger scale political events  including terrorist acts 
we outsource data processing and other functions to third parties 
if our third party providers encounter difficulties or become the source of an attack on or breach of operational systems  data or infrastructure  or if we have difficulty communicating with any such third party system  our business operations could suffer 
any failure or disruption to our systems  or those of a third party provider  could impede our service delivery  customer relationship management  data processing  financial reporting or risk management 
there can be no assurance that our policies  procedures and protective measures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure  interruption or security breach will be effective  and if significant failure  interruption or security breaches does occur  we could suffer damage to our reputation  a loss of customer business  additional regulatory scrutiny  or exposure to civil litigation  additional costs and possible financial liability 
if we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure  systems  controls and personnel relative to our size and products and services  our ability to effectively operate our business may be impaired and our business could be adversely affected 
our participation in the us treasury s capital purchase program subjects us to certain restrictions 
on january   we issued approximately million of our senior preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to the treasury under the tarp cpp 
based on our participation in the cpp  we agreed to comply with its terms and conditions  which subjects us to certain restrictions  oversight  costs and compliance and reputational risks 
for example  we may not  without the consent of the treasury  increase our dividend  currently per share per quarter  above a rate of per quarter or  subject to certain exceptions  engage in repurchases of our common stock or trust preferred securities until january  or  if earlier  the date on which all preferred stock issued to the treasury has been redeemed or transferred by the treasury 
our participation in the cpp also subjects us to additional executive compensation and other restrictions  which may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified senior executive officers and other employees  particularly in light of the fact that some of the financial institutions with which we compete are not subject to the restrictions imposed by the cpp 
furthermore  under the terms of the securities purchase agreement we entered into with the treasury  the treasury will be able to unilaterally amend the agreement to make it consistent with any subsequent statutory provisions implemented by congress 
if we fail to comply with the terms and conditions of the program or the securities purchase agreement  including any restrictions upon our use of the cpp proceeds  we could become subject to a regulatory enforcement action or legal proceedings brought by the us government  which  in turn  would present significant reputational risks for us that could affect our ability to retain or attract new clients or investors if and when we determine to raise additional capital or both 

table of contents we have counterparty risk  the creditworthiness of other financial institutions could expose us to losses on contracts we have with these institutions and could adversely affect our ability to provide services to our clients  specifically products and services relating to foreign exchange  derivatives and letters of credit 
our ability to provide certain products and service could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other banks 
banks are interrelated as a result of lending  clearing  correspondent  counterparty and other relationships 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more banks  or the banking industry generally  have in the past led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
many of the transactions engaged in by us in the ordinary course of business  particularly in our capital markets group  expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or customer 
in such instances  the collateral we hold may be insufficient to mitigate our losses  as we may be unable to realize or liquidate at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of our exposure 
such losses could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our capital markets group offers an extensive range of over the counter interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives products 
although we do not engage in any proprietary trading and we structure these client generated trading activities to mitigate our exposure to market risk  we remain exposed to various risks  the most significant of which include credit risk of our counterparties  operational risk and settlement risk  which may be most significant in foreign exchange transactions where timing differences between settlement centers can result in us paying our client and or counterparty before actually receiving the funds 
the exposure of our counterparties requires active monitoring as well as liquidity management to ensure timely and cost efficient posting of collateral 
operational risk includes errors in execution of internal bank procedures and controls  which could expose us to financial and or reputation loss 
a lapse or breakdown of these procedures or controls could significantly increase our exposure to counterparty credit risk and operational risk  which could result in a material loss to us 
risks related to our operating environment weak economic conditions could continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
various segments of the us economy have been in a prolonged and deep slowdown over the past four years  and there is continuing uncertainty  volatility and stress in the us economy and the local economies in each of our markets 
continued and sustained periods of uncertainty  prolonged periods of unemployment  volatility or further deterioration in the international  national or local business or economic conditions could result in  among other things  a further deterioration of credit quality  including a resultant effect on our loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses  and a reduced demand for credit 
in addition  higher corporate taxes in the state of illinois may contribute to an adverse climate for doing business in the state 
continued sustained weakness and uncertainty in business and economic conditions generally  or in our markets specifically  could adversely impact our business through more clients and counterparties becoming delinquent  filing for protection under bankruptcy laws or defaulting on their loans or other obligations to us  a decrease in the value of the collateral underlying loans  requiring paydowns by our borrowers to remain in loan to value compliance  restricting borrower access to liquidity as defined by borrowing arrangements or  alternatively  resulting in a default  a decrease in the value of any loans that we may hold for sale or property acquired upon default  lengthy holding periods required to liquidate property acquired upon default or loans held for sale  thereby increasing carrying costs and potentially impacting market values  and sluggish demand for loans and other products and services offered by us 
an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults in future periods could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets  net charge offs  provision for loan and covered asset losses  and valuation adjustments on any loans held for sale  which would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes 
our operating results are largely dependent on our net interest income 
fluctuations in interest rates may significantly affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on earning assets  usually loans and investment securities  and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings 
we are unable to predict fluctuations in interest rates  which are affected by factors including monetary policy of the frb  actual inflation or deflation or expectations regarding the same  recession  unemployment rates  money supply  domestic and foreign events  and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets 
the timing of any frb action to curtail or eliminate various stimulus related programs  as a result of inflation concerns or otherwise  could have an impact on interest rates in general and our net interest margin in particular 

table of contents our investment portfolio also contains interest rate sensitive instruments that may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates or spreads caused by governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  issuer or insurer credit deterioration and other factors beyond our control 
a rise in interest rates or spread widening would reduce the net unrealized gains currently reflected in our investment portfolio and slowdown prepayment  offset by our ability to earn higher rates of return on funds reinvested 
demand for the products or services of our capital markets group could be negatively impacted by interest rate changes and a decrease in sales volumes from this group could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
global economic uncertainty and the potential for a deterioration in the european sovereign debt crisis may adversely affect the financial services industry and could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
continuing uncertainty in the economic  political and financial markets and the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in europe could impact our customers and could negatively affect our credit portfolio and liquidity position 
there have been recent periods of extreme volatility in the global financial markets and the financial turmoil and uncertainty with respect to the euro zone crisis could threaten the stability of the global banking system and the company s financial condition 
continuing uncertainty and volatility or a disruption in the global financial markets could impact the company s financial condition to the extent it causes stress on the united states financial services industry 
the company also faces risks related to our counterparties who may have exposure in european sovereign debt holdings  particularly those countries experiencing significant economic  fiscal or political strains 
although we had no direct funded or non funded exposure to european sovereign or non sovereign entities in either our held to maturity or available for sale portfolios as of december   we conduct business with european financial institutions headquartered in the united kingdom  switzerland  france  and germany  related to repurchase agreements  interest rate swaps  balance sheet hedging  foreign exchange transactions and letter of credit issuance 
as is common market practice  certain of our interest rate derivatives and letter of credit transactions with such european financial institutions are collateralized with investment securities that we have been required to pledge to the counterparty institution 
should one of these counterparties experience significant financial distress  those securities could become so called trapped collateral pending resolution of any applicable proceedings 
in addition  although we primarily lend to us commercial clients  the operations  and therefore financial stability  of some of those clients may be affected by disruption or volatility in europe 
further  the company may have direct and or indirect exposure to foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of us domiciled commercial clients 
such subsidiaries and affiliates may be co borrowers or guarantors of the us client s credit facilities 
in some cases  assets or stock of such subsidiaries or affiliates may be pledged to secure payment and performance of certain credit facilities 
at this time  we cannot predict the impact this may have on our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to the financial services industry we are highly regulated and may be adversely affected by changes in banking laws  regulations  and regulatory practices 
we are subject to extensive supervision  regulation and examination 
this regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing consumer credit  and anti money laundering and anti terrorism laws  but also capital adequacy  asset quality and risk  management ability and performance  earnings  liquidity  and various other factors 
as part of this regulatory structure  we are subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to capital levels  the timing and amount of dividend payments  the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
under this structure the regulatory agencies have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations if they determine  among other things  that our operations are unsafe or unsound  fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies 
this supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct  growth and profitability of our operations 
any failure on our part to comply with current laws  regulations  other regulatory requirements or expectations or safe and sound banking practices or concerns about our financial condition  or any related regulatory sanctions or adverse actions against us  could increase our costs or restrict our ability to expand our business and result in damage to our reputation 
changes in laws  regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting the financial services industry  and the effects of such changes  are difficult to predict and may have unintended consequences 
new regulations or changes in the regulatory environment could limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
these changes also can adversely affect borrowers  potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans 
the impact of the recently enacted dodd frank act is still uncertain  is expected to increase our regulatory compliance burden and costs of doing business and could result in enhanced capital and leverage requirements and restrictions on certain products and services we offer 
in july  president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act which significantly changes the financial regulatory landscape and will affect the operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies as well as others 
although many of the details of the dodd frank act and the full impact it will have on our business or revenues are 
table of contents uncertain at this point  in part because many of the provisions require the adoption of implementing rules and regulations  the burden of compliance with the new law and its rules and regulations will increase operating costs and may reduce revenue 
in addition to capital requirements as previously discussed  the dodd frank act also increases the regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions 
this is expected to impact our capital markets group which offers an extensive range of over the counter interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives products to our clients 
the regulations are expected to impose additional reporting and monitoring requirements  require higher capital and margin requirements and require that certain trades be executed through clearinghouses  all of which would likely result in added costs of doing business 
depending on the outcome of regulatory implementation including  but not limited to  the definition of swap dealers and related compliance rules  the prospects for our capital markets business  the demand for its products and the types of products it may cost effectively offer may be diminished 
the dodd frank act repealed the prohibition on banks payment of interest on demand deposit accounts of commercial clients beginning one year from the date of enactment  and the market impact of this change at this stage has not been meaningful 
however  under different market and economic conditions  it may have an impact on the level and cost of liquidity 
another significant aspect of the dodd frank act that will affect us is the creation of a new bureau of consumer financial protection the bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the bureau will have broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
among other things  it is anticipated that the bureau may consider significant reforms in the mortgage industry that could have an adverse affect on our mortgage business 
no assurance can be given as to the ultimate effect that the dodd frank act or any of its provisions will have on our business  financial condition and results of operations  the financial services industry or the economy 
our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry 
we face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors 
our future success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment 
we compete for loans  deposits  wealth management and other financial services in our geographic markets with other commercial banks  financial companies  thrifts  credit unions and brokerage firms operating in the markets we serve 
many of our competitors offer products and services that we do not or have greater resources and economies of scale to offer products and services that we offer more cost effectively 
certain of our competitors may have better name recognition and market presence that could benefit them in attracting business 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do or offer more favorable terms 
to be competitive  we will need to continue to invest in technology  infrastructure and human resources 
this investment is directed at enhancing our risk management function and generating new products and services  and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of our clients and regulators 
falling behind our competitors  who may have more extensive resources to invest  in any of these areas  could adversely affect our business

when we use the term the bank  we are referring to our wholly owned banking subsidiary  the privatebank brand 
the following discussion is designed to provide stockholders with a comprehensive review of our operating results and financial condition and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes thereto  and other financial information presented in this form k 
unless otherwise stated  all earnings per share data included in this section and through the remainder of this discussion are presented on a diluted basis 
overview we reported net income available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  an improvement from a net loss of million  or per diluted share in the financial performance of the company in reflected our focused efforts on executing our relationship based commercial middle market strategy and improving asset quality 
this is reflected in billion in new client relationships added during the year  million growth in our higher yielding commercial and industrial loan portfolio an increase from the prior year  the majority of which came from new client relationships and improved loan mix with the commercial and industrial portfolio representing of total loans at year end compared to at year end we also saw meaningful improvement in our asset quality metrics across the board  with nonperforming loans and assets declining and  respectively  from year end as a result of problem asset dispositions of million during  movement of million of nonperforming loans to other real estate owned oreo during  and moderating nonperforming loan inflows resulting from a reduction in early stage problem loans which declined by million  or  at december  compared to the prior year levels 
with credit quality improving  the provision for loans losses  excluding covered assets  declined million from levels and we reduced our allowance for loan losses by million from the prior year end 
total deposits were billion at the end of  relatively flat compared to year end noninterest bearing deposits  however  made up of total deposits at the end of  compared to at the end of  reflecting a increase in such deposits from december  the increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits is due in part to the current interest rate environment and client desires for greater liquidity 
the shift in the loan mix  improving credit quality  deposit repricing and higher demand deposits helped contribute to a net interest margin of for  up basis points from during  non interest income and net revenue benefited from successful cross selling efforts of our fee based products such as capital markets  treasury management and other credit related services to both the new and existing client base 
although expenses continue to be impacted by higher net foreclosed property costs due mostly to a higher volume of asset dispositions in and a increase in the oreo balance at the end of compared to the prior year resulting from continued asset workout efforts and higher compensation expense  total non interest expenses for remained relatively flat at million compared to the prior year reflecting management s ongoing cost control efforts 
operating profit totaled million  up from prior year  and was favorably impacted by higher net revenue and relatively unchanged expense levels 
excluding net securities gains  operating profit increased million  or  from please refer to the remaining sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for greater discussion of the various components of our performance  statement of condition and liquidity 
results of operations the profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income  provision for loan and covered loan losses  non interest income  and non interest expense 
net interest income is dependent on the amount of and yields earned on interest earning assets as compared to the amount of and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset liability management strategy 
the provision for loan and covered loan losses is primarily affected by changes in the loan portfolio s composition and performance  the identification of nonperforming loans  management s 
table of contents assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio  and loss experience  as well as economic and market factors 
non interest income consists primarily of fee revenue from trust and investments  mortgage banking  capital markets products  treasury management  loan and credit related fees  and other services charges and fees 
net securities gains losses  if any  are also included in non interest income 
net interest income net interest income equals the excess of interest income including discount accretion on covered loans plus fees earned on interest earning assets over interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities impact net interest income 
interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income 
interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities that fund those assets 
the net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average interest earning assets 
the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest bearing sources of funds  principally noninterest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity  also support interest earning assets 
the accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income on loans  securities  and other interest earning assets are included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
our accounting and reporting policies conform to us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and general practice within the financial services industry 
for purposes of this discussion  net interest income and any ratios or metrics that include net interest income as a component  such as for example  net interest margin  have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax exempt securities to those on taxable interest earning assets 
although we believe that these non us gaap financial measures enhance investors understanding of our business and performance  these non us gaap financial measures should not be considered an alternative to us gaap 
the reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income is presented in the following table 
table effect of tax equivalent adjustment dollars in thousands years ended december  change net interest income us gaap tax equivalent adjustment tax equivalent net interest income table summarizes the changes in our average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as the average interest rates earned and paid on these assets and liabilities  respectively  for the three years ended december  the table also presents the trend in net interest margin on a quarterly basis for and  including the tax equivalent yields on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities

compared to for  net interest margin was  an increase of basis points from for the improvement results from a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits and an increase in noninterest bearing deposits  offset partially by a decrease in the yield on the investment portfolio as discussed below 
also  the shift in the mix of the loan portfolio toward higher yielding commercial loans and some large non recurring loan fees increased the average interest rate earned on loans by two basis points 
along with the shift in the mix of the loan portfolio to higher yielding commercial loans  the level of average nonperforming loans year over year was reduced by million  mitigating any pricing compression seen within the commercial loan portfolio as well as the million reduction in interest income on covered assets from the prior year 
the lower interest rate environment negatively impacted the yield on the investment portfolio  resulting in a year over year reduction in interest income on a tax equivalent basis of million  despite the million increase in the average balance of total securities 
we do not anticipate significant continued benefit to net interest margin in future periods from downward repricing of deposits 
heightened competition  in the face of limited middle market loan demand  could also pressure loan pricing and loan growth in the near term  although year to date we have been successful in maintaining overall yield on our commercial loan portfolio 
this reflects 
table of contents higher lending yields in specialized areas that we have pursued  lower levels of nonperforming loans  and some large nonrecurring loans fees 
the reshaping of our loan mix  increases in short term interest rates  and further reduction in nonperforming loans may help to mitigate the impact of loan pricing compression on net interest margin in future periods 
in  we initiated the use of interest rate derivatives as part of our asset liability management strategy to hedge interest rate risk in our primarily floating rate loan portfolio and  depending on market conditions  including the slope of the yield curve  we intend to enter into additional interest rate swaps 
a description and analysis of our market risk and interest rate sensitivity profile and management policies is included in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  of this form k 
compared to for  net interest margin was  an increase of basis points from in a higher volume of interest earning assets positively impacted interest income by million  while a decline in the average rate earned on covered assets and securities had a negative impact of million 
despite an increase of million on average nonaccrual loans from to  the yield on loans  excluding covered assets  improved six basis points from the increase in loan yields reflects a change in loan mix more heavily weighted to higher yielding commercial loans than lower yielding commercial real estate loans 
lower short term interest rates and deposit repricing initiatives decreased interest expense by million  offset in part by higher interest rates paid on borrowings 
while total average interest bearing liabilities increased during  a favorable shift in the mix lowered the amount of higher cost funding and led to a million reduction in interest expense due to volume 
increases in net interest margin and interest income for include the benefit of a full year of higher interest earning covered assets from the mid fdic assisted acquisition 
covered asset accretion positively impacted net interest margin by and basis points for the years ended december  and  respectively

table of contents non interest income non interest income is derived from a number of sources related to our banking activities  including loan and credit related fees  the sale of derivative products to clients through our capital markets group  treasury management services  and fees from our trust and investments business 
the following table presents a break out of these multiple sources of revenue for the years ended december   and table non interest income analysis dollars in thousands years ended december  change trust and investments mortgage banking capital markets products treasury management loan and credit related fees other income  service charges  and fees   n m subtotal fee revenue net securities gains early extinguishment of debt n m total non interest income n m not meaningful compared to non interest income for was million  an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year period  with all major categories  excluding mortgage banking and trust and investments  contributing to the year over year growth 
excluding securities gains  non interest income increased by million or to million for  compared to million for trust and investments fee revenue declined slightly  by  from levels 
during  we gained momentum in carrying out our strategic initiative to retool and enhance our wealth management business and services through the addition and expansion of new and existing clients 
however  trust and investments fee revenue for was impacted by certain nonrecurring larger estate fees recognized in the prior year period  lower retail tax preparation fees  lower fees from our land trust business  which was sold in early and some client attrition 
also  due to the implementation of a new strategic approach to servicing our client s investment portfolios which creates a greater reliance on pooled investment vehicles  such as mutual funds and etfs  and a reduction in using third party account managers  fees were negatively impacted with a commensurate reduction to investment expenses 
in addition  trust and investment fee revenue is largely dependent on the composition and valuation of assets under management and administration auma  and for  there were lower comparative values of auma on the date of fee measurement as compared to the prior year 
for approximately of the auma portfolio whose fees are generated off the value of the assets as of december   the billing date is the last date of the preceding quarter or month creating fluctuations in the fees recognized during the period which may differ from fluctuations in period end auma 
auma includes assets held in trusts where we serve as trustee  accounts where we make investment decisions on behalf of clients  and non managed assets we hold in custody for clients or for which we receive fees for advisory or brokerage services 
excluding million in deposits included in auma  we do not include these assets on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
revenue from our mortgage banking business was lower by million  or  from  as the prior year experienced an extended period of lower mortgage interest rates and higher refinancing activity as compared to the current year 
unlike the prior year  in  significant refinancing application volume did not begin until the drop in interest rates in august 
application volume remained strong until the end of  and as such  we anticipate this positive trend will continue through the first quarter of capital markets products income increased million from and included a  negative credit valuation adjustment cva compared to a negative cva of million for the cva represents the credit component of fair value with regard to both client based derivatives and the related matched derivatives with interbank dealer counterparties 
exclusive of cva  capital markets income increased to million in compared to million in  and was primarily attributable to increased 
table of contents client interest rate swap fees resulting from both loan originations and renewals  larger margin transactions in the current year  and higher foreign exchange revenue from increased transactions as part of our clients ongoing business activities  a small number of large transactions and increased volatility in foreign exchange markets 
approximately of the increase in capital markets revenues came from an increased penetration of our client base 
there can be no assurances such increased penetration will continue 
our treasury management group offers a full range of receivables and payables services in addition to online banking and reporting 
these products and services include remote capture  liquidity management and lockbox services which are often linked to non interest and interest bearing deposits 
treasury management income increased million  or  from revenue growth is closely correlated with acquisition of new middle market lending clients with loan growth  though subject to a three to six month lag of implementation 
the current year increase reflects ongoing success in cross selling treasury management services to new and existing commercial clients as well as the full year impact of new clients added during in addition  during  our earnings credit rate the rate applied to balances maintained in the client s deposit account to offset activity charges remained in line with market and deposit interest rates  declining slightly during the year and providing a small contribution to the overall increase in fees 
loan and credit related fees include income generated from letters of credit  unused commitments  loan syndications and various non yield loan fees 
loan and credit related fees increased million  or  from the prior year and is principally due to a higher volume of syndication revenue driven by increased lead agency credits as we leveraged our reputation for execution and expended distribution network 
letter of credit and unused commitment fees were also higher in the current year 
certain fee revenue is earned contemporaneously with or shortly after successfully generating new client relationships and related loans 
however  we also expect additional fee revenue from those new clients over time as we penetrate deeper within those relationships and execute upon our cross sell strategy 
given the more than billion in new client relationships during  as well as the mix of our loan portfolio being predominately commercial of our total loans as of december  were commercial  which we believe provides the most cross sell opportunity  we may see additional fee revenues from these new clients in the future 
other income  service charges  and fees increased million  or  from the increase was primarily due to  in gains on various asset dispositions in  including the sale of our land trust business earlier in the year  as well as  in losses in the prior year on loans held for sale 
net securities gains totaled million for  compared to million for the prior year 
during  we sold million of securities  which included million of collateralized mortgage obligations  million of residential mortgage backed securities  million in us agencies  and million of state and municipal securities 
the sales assisted in managing prepayment risk and provided a measure of benefit to our capital position 
we frequently evaluate our securities and from time to time may take advantage of what we perceive to be pricing opportunities in the market for specific investments 
compared to total non interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million in  reflecting continued success in penetrating and cross selling targeted middle market commercial relationships 
our total fee revenue for was million  an increase of million  or  from million in treasury management income increased million  or  from this increase was attributable to improved capabilities in offering a broader suite of products and services to new and existing clients and increasing penetration in our clients transaction based activities 
trust and investments income increased million  or  from and was attributable to increases in the value of auma  in part due to improved equity and fixed income market performance 
total auma totaled billion  increasing by million  or  from december  to billion at december  mortgage banking income increased million  or  from  reflecting the broader industry trend of increased refinancing based on the low interest rate environment that prevailed during capital markets income decreased million  or  from of the million decrease  million represents changes in the credit valuation adjustment  with an  positive cva in and a negative million cva in exclusive of cva adjustments  capital markets income decreased year over year  reflecting the reduced client demand for interest rate derivatives  offset by a million increase in foreign exchange revenues  resulting from our implementation of enhanced client interface tools to improve our foreign exchange product offering

this increase was partially offset by the favorable impact on current year incentive compensation expense and accruals of the implementation of a new plan feature requiring a portion of the current year bonus for certain employees to be deferred over a future defined service period 
technology and related costs increased million  or  from due to various systems upgrades occurring during including our items processing platform and our data network 
professional services expense  which includes fees paid for legal  accounting  and consulting services  decreased million  or  from the decrease is primarily due to higher prior year costs relating to risk management consultants  system conversion fees in connection with the integration of the fdic assisted acquisition of the former founders bank  and audit fees 
net foreclosed property expense  which includes write downs on foreclosed properties  gains and losses on sales of foreclosed properties  taxes  and other expenses associated with the maintenance of oreo  increased million  or  from the increase in net foreclosed property expenses is primarily due to higher net losses on the sale of oreo resulting from the accelerated pace of sales  as well as the million increase in oreo balances during due to the rate of nonperforming loan workouts surpassing asset dispositions and higher valuation write downs resulting from updated appraisals during as compared to in  we incurred million in net losses on sale of oreo compared to million in also  oreo write downs totaled million for compared to million for the prior year 
while the balance of nonperforming loans has steadily decreased throughout  they were million at year end 
as a result of this and current oreo balances  we expect net foreclosed property expense to remain at elevated levels as we actively resolve problem loans and liquidate oreo 
in evaluating to sell oreo  we seek to maximize our ultimate net recovery 
the timing of dispositions will depend on a number of factors  including the pace and timing of the overall recovery of the economy  activity and pricing levels in the real estate market and real estate inventory coming onto the market for sale 
insurance expense decreased million  or  from  primarily due to lower deposit insurance assessments as a result of the change in fdic insurance assessment methodology 
in february  the fdic adopted final rules amending the deposit insurance assessment regulations  modifying  among other provisions  the assessment base from one based on domestic deposits to one based on total assets less average tangible equity 
the final rules took effect april   impacting assessments beginning in the second quarter loan and collection expense  which consists of certain non reimbursable costs associated with performing loan activities and loan remediation costs of problem and nonperforming loans  decreased million  or  from largely due to a lower level of performing loan costs largely attributable to reduced refinance volumes on a comparative basis 
overall levels remain elevated given the magnitude of problem asset remediation expense 
other expenses decreased million  or  from the prior year 
other expenses include various categories such as bank charges  costs associated with the cdars product offering  education related costs  subscriptions  provisions for unfunded commitments and miscellaneous losses and expenses 
the decrease was primarily due to an  reduction of the reserve for unfunded commitments in  compared to a provision for unfunded commitments of million recorded in  as the clients average credit quality has improved  while at the same time the level of propensity to fund was also lower in the current economic environment 
in addition  decreased volume and rates reduced cdars servicing fees by  from the prior year 
compared to non interest expense increased million  or  from the increase was primarily due to higher compensation expense  an increase in net foreclosed property and loan and collection expenses related to credit deterioration  and a higher provision for unfunded commitments as compared to the prior year 
compensation expense increased million  or  from and is largely attributable to higher annual incentive compensation  a higher level of average ftes as a result of the fdic assisted transaction in mid  and increases in commission based compensation 
incentive compensation expense was higher in  as the prior year did not include any significant level of bonus expense due to the loss from continuing operations reported in 
table of contents net occupancy expense increased million  or  from the increase in net occupancy expense from the prior year reflects  in additional facility rental expense  million in increased depreciation expense  and  in increased maintenance contract expense related to additional offices acquired in the fdic assisted transaction  as well as our increased office space 
professional services  which includes fees paid for legal  accounting  and consulting services  decreased million  or  from the decrease from the prior year relates in part to non recurring expenses incurred in in connection with the fdic assisted transaction and subsequent integration activities 
net foreclosed property expense  which includes write downs on foreclosed properties  gains and losses on sales of foreclosed properties  and other expenses associated with the foreclosure process and maintenance of oreo  increased million from the increase in net foreclosed property expense is primarily due to maintenance and administration associated with a higher volume of oreo properties  coupled with higher valuation write downs in as compared to the prior year 
insurance expense increased million  or  from excluding the million fdic special assessment in  deposit insurance premiums increased in due to the combined effect of a higher deposit base upon which fees are assessed  higher fee rates  and the additional basis point assessment paid on covered transaction accounts exceeding  under the transaction account guarantee program 
loan and collection expense increased million  or  from due to a higher volume of appraisals and legal costs incurred in connection with credit remediation efforts on our nonperforming loans 
other expenses increased million  or  from the increase was attributable to a million increase in the provision for unfunded commitments offset by a million decrease in restructuring charges primarily relating to income taxes our provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income tax expense 
an analysis of the provision for income taxes and the effective income tax rates for the periods through are presented in the following table 
table income tax provision analysis dollars in thousands years ended december  income loss before income tax provision income tax expense benefit effective income tax benefit rate n m n m not meaningful generally  our effective income tax rate varies from the statutory federal income tax rate of federal income tax benefit rate for principally due to state income taxes  the effects of tax exempt earnings from municipal securities and bank owned life insurance  non deductible compensation and business expenses and tax credits 
for  the effective tax rate was also impacted by a million tax benefit associated with the repricing of our deferred tax asset due to a change in the illinois corporate income tax rate that became effective during the first quarter 
excluding this one time benefit in  our effective income tax rate would have been 
the impact of the illinois tax rate increase on pre tax earnings increased our effective tax rate by approximately 
we expect our effective income tax rate in to be modestly higher than this adjusted rate due primarily to share price valuation and its impact on the tax benefits related to stock based compensation  as discussed below 
the effective tax rate in was not meaningful because the small amount of pre tax income caused the permanent differences described above to disproportionately impact the effective tax rate compared to what would have normally been expected 
realization of deferred tax assets net deferred tax assets are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition 

table of contents during the first three quarterly periods of  we were in a cumulative pre tax loss position for financial statement purposes  measured on a trailing three year period basis 
under current accounting guidance  this represents significant negative evidence in the assessment of whether deferred tax assets will be realized 
at december   we are no longer in a cumulative book loss position 
we have concluded that based on the weight provided by certain positive evidence discussed below  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
taxable income in prior years and reversing deferred taxable income amounts provide sources from which deferred tax assets may be absorbed 
most significantly  however  we have relied on our ability to generate future federal taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences  as the primary source from which deferred tax assets will be absorbed 
in making the determination at december  that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized  we considered the positive evidence associated with a taxable income generated in and  b reversing taxable temporary differences in future periods  c our emergence from a cumulative book loss position in  d continued improvement in pre tax  pre loan loss provision earnings results during  a core source for future taxable income  e our reporting of pre tax profits during most of and  f the concentration of credit losses in certain segments and vintages of our loan portfolio during the past three years and the relative moderation of credit trends in recent quarters  g our excess capital position relative to well capitalized regulatory standards and other industry benchmarks  and h no history of federal net operating loss carryforwards and the availability of the year federal net operating loss carryforward period 
we considered negative evidence associated with the continuing challenging economic conditions as well as both positive and negative evidence associated with a our accuracy in forecasting operating income and credit costs  and b the estimated timing of reversals of deferred deductible and deferred taxable items and the level of such net reversal amounts relative to earnings run rate assumptions in future periods 
certain of the factors noted above support our expectation of generating pre tax book earnings in future periods 
we believe this in turn should give rise to taxable income levels exclusive of reversing temporary differences that more likely than not would be sufficient to absorb the deferred tax assets 
at december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets that relate to equity compensation awards  including both unexercised stock options and unvested restricted shares 
in both cases  the deferred tax assets may not be fully realized in future periods primarily due to stock price valuation 
currently  most of our stock options are out of the money with an exercise price above our current stock price 
depending in part on changes in our stock price  we could incur tax charges at the expiration date of the options or prior to that time if employees terminate and out of the money options expire  or in certain instances  when employees exercise options 
in the case of restricted shares  the tax benefits will not be fully realized if the fair market value of the awards on the vesting release date is less than the value of the awards on the grant modification date 
in such circumstances where there is a shortfall in tax benefits on the exercise  vesting or expiration of an equity award  such shortfall amounts are charged to stockholders equity if there is a sufficient level of excess tax benefits accumulated from prior years 
during and  such shortfall amounts charged to stockholders equity totaled million and million  respectively 
in addition  during  we charged  of such shortfall tax benefits to income tax expense because the balance of cumulative prior year excess tax benefits was reduced to this resulted in an increase in the effective tax rate in based on our current stock price level  scheduled vesting of restricted shares and anticipated option expirations  we expect to incur additional shortfall tax charges in which will put upward pressure on our effective income tax rate as described above 
the amount of such shortfall charges in and in future periods is dependent on changes in our stock price as well as the impact of employee terminations  option exercise decisions and other factors 
operating segments results we have three primary business segments banking  trust and investments  and holding company activities 
banking the profitability of our banking segment is dependent on net interest income  provision for loan losses  non interest income  and non interest expense 
the net income for the banking segment for was million  a million increase from net income of million for the increase in net income for the banking segment was primarily due to a million in lower provision for loan losses offset by million in higher non interest expense in as compared to the prior year

recurring operating expenses consist primarily of share based compensation and professional fees 
the holding company activities segment reported a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the same period in and a net loss of million for the reduction is due to lower interest expense on certain junior subordinated debt securities which have repriced downward  as well as reduced professional fees

investments are comprised of debt securities and non marketable equity investments 
our debt securities portfolio is primarily comprised of residential mortgage backed pools  collateralized mortgage obligations  us treasury and agency securities  and state and municipal bonds 
debt securities that are classified as available for sale are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of our asset liability management strategy in response to changes in interest rates  liquidity needs or significant prepayment risk

this balance sheet component will fluctuate as current market interest rates and conditions change  which changes affect the aggregate fair value of the portfolio 
in periods of significant market volatility  we may experience significant changes in accumulated other comprehensive income 
accumulated other comprehensive income is not included in the calculation of regulatory capital 
debt securities that are classified as held to maturity are securities we have the ability and intent to hold until maturity and are accounted for using historical cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts

within our commercial lending business  we have a specialized niche in the assisted living  nursing and residential care segment of the healthcare industry 
at december   of the commercial loan portfolio had been extended primarily to operators in this segment to finance the working capital needs and cost of facilities providing such services 
these loans tend to be larger extensions of credit and are primarily to for profit businesses 
to date  this portfolio segment has experienced minimal defaults and losses 
commercial real estate decreased million from december  due to a combination of problem loan dispositions  fewer new originations although we experienced some increased activity during the second half of  and transitional financing being repaid or refinanced as expected in the secondary market for long term permanent financing or by other external sources 
the collateral underlying our commercial real estate portfolio is principally located in and around our core markets and is significantly concentrated in the chicago metropolitan area 
declines of million in the construction portfolio from december  are partially due to projects reaching completion at which point they are reclassified into the commercial real estate category  as well as problem loan dispositions  payoffs or paydowns  and movements to oreo

delinquent loans  special mention and potential problem loans  and nonperforming assets loans are reported delinquent if the required principal and interest payments have not been received within days of the date such payment is due 
delinquency can be driven by either failure of the borrower to make payments within the term of the loan or failure to make the final payment at maturity 
the majority of our loans are not fully amortizing over the term 
as a result  a sizeable final repayment is often required at maturity 
if a borrower lacks refinancing options or the ability to pay  the loan may become delinquent at maturity 
of total commercial real estate and construction loans outstanding at december   million are scheduled to mature in the first quarter of  of which all but were performing at december  loans considered special mention are performing in accordance with the contractual terms but demonstrate potential weakness that if left unresolved  may result in deterioration in the company s credit position and or the repayment prospects for the credit 
borrowers rated special mention may exhibit adverse operating trends  high leverage  tight liquidity  or other credit concerns 
potential problem loans are loans that we have identified as performing in accordance with contractual terms  but for which management has some level of concern greater than that of special mention loans about the ability of the borrowers to meet existing repayment terms in future periods 
these loans continue to accrue interest but the ultimate collection of these loans is questionable due to the same conditions that characterize a special mention credit 
these credits may also be considered inadequately protected by the current net worth and or paying capacity of the obligor or guarantors or the collateral pledged 
these loans generally have a well defined weakness or weaknesses that may jeopardize collection of the debt and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not resolved 
although these loans are generally identified as potential problem loans and require additional attention by management  they may never become nonperforming 
special mention and potential problem loans as of december  and are presented in table nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and real estate that has been acquired primarily through foreclosure proceedings and are awaiting disposition and are presented in table nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans  including restructured loans that remain on nonaccrual 
we specifically exclude certain restructured loans that accrue interest from our definition of nonperforming loans if the borrower has demonstrated the ability to meet the new terms of the restructuring as evidenced by a 
table of contents minimum of at least six months of performance in compliance with the restructured terms or if the borrower s performance prior to the restructuring or other significant events at the time of the restructuring supports returning or maintaining the loan on accrual status 
all loans are placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest payments become days past due or earlier if management deems the collectability of the principal or interest to be in question rather than waiting until the loans become days past due 
when interest accruals are discontinued  accrued but uncollected interest is reversed reducing interest income 
subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded in the financial statements as a reduction of principal  and interest income is only recorded on a cash basis after principal recovery is reasonably assured 
classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not necessarily preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal and or interest 
nonperforming loans are presented in tables    and foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans secured by a mortgage on real property 
foreclosed assets are recorded at the lesser of current carrying value or estimated fair value  less estimated selling costs at the time of foreclosure 
write downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
on a periodic basis  the carrying values of these properties are adjusted based upon new appraisals and or market indications 
write downs are recorded for subsequent declines in net realizable value and are included in non interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties 
additional information on our oreo is presented in tables through as part of our ongoing risk management practices and in certain circumstances  we may extend or modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties 
the modification may consist of concessionary reduction in interest rate  extension of the maturity date  reduction in the principal balance  or other action intended to minimize potential losses that would otherwise not be considered in order to improve the chance of a successful recovery on the loan 
such concessions as part of a modification are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings tdrs 
restructured loans can involve loans remaining on nonaccrual  moving to nonaccrual  or continuing on accrual status  depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower 
we may utilize a multiple note structure as a workout alternative for certain loans 
the multiple note structure typically bifurcates a troubled loan into two separate notes  where the first note is reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to the modified terms  and the second note of the troubled loan that is not reasonably assured of repayment is charged off 
tdrs accrue interest as long as the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has historically demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms  otherwise  the restructured loan will be classified as nonaccrual 
restructured loans accruing interest were million at december   compared to million at december  of total restructured loans accruing interest modified during the year ended december   were modified to extend the maturity date and were from commercial loan relationships 
the composition of our restructured loans accruing interest by loan category and our recorded investment is presented in tables and during  million in loans that were previously classified as a restructured loans accruing interest were subsequently re underwritten as pass rated credits which is evidence that the borrower would no longer be considered troubled  and as such  the tdr classification was removed 
total nonperforming assets declined to million at december  from million at december   reflecting strong progress in improving the overall asset quality of the portfolio and reducing problem assets 
nonperforming assets were of total assets at december   compared to at december  during the year  total nonperforming loans declined by million  or  due to disposition activity  moderating nonperforming loan inflows  and movement of nonperforming loans to oreo 
oreo increased million  or  from december   as problem loans continue to progress through the workout process 
disposition activity and ongoing workout efforts drove a reduction in special mention and potential problem loans 
loans in these early stage problem loan categories were down million  or  from december  to million at december  disposition activity in included the sale of million in problem loans  including million in nonperforming loans  and million in oreo at a net incremental charge based on the carrying value net of specific reserves at the time of disposition 
in  we will continue to assess the market for the best disposition strategy and approach 
as we work through the remainder of the portfolio  we may see some fluctuations in disposition prices 
nonperforming loans were million at december   down from million at december  the amount of nonperforming loan inflows  which is primarily composed of potential problem loans moving through the workout process ie  moving from potential problem to nonperforming status  were million for compared to million for inflows to nonperforming loans were more than offset by problem loan resolutions including transfers to oreo  dispositions  and charge offs during as shown in table providing nonperforming loan stratification by size  twelve nonperforming loans in excess of million comprised of our total nonperforming loans at december  commercial real estate and construction loans were of our total nonperforming loans at december   reflecting the stress in the sector 
as discussed above  our focused asset management activities led to declines in special mention and potential problem loans year over year as we have worked to improve overall credit quality 
since the majority of inflows to nonperforming loans have been migrating from the special mention or potential problem loan categories  we expect that future nonperforming loan inflows will likely continue to moderate 
however  because many of our potential problem loans are commercial real estate related  a highly stressed loan sector  
table of contents and because the potential problem loan population contains some larger sized credits  our total nonperforming loans may fluctuate over the next several quarters as we continue to execute remediation plans and work through the credit cycle 
in addition  credit quality trends may also be impacted by the uncertainty in global economic conditions and market turmoil that could disrupt workout plans  adversely affect clients  or negatively impact collateral valuations 
further  net nonperforming asset levels could fluctuate depending on the timing of dispositions or other remediation actions 
our efforts to continue to dispose of nonperforming and problem assets in future quarters may be impacted by a number of factors  including but not limited to  the pace and timing of the overall recovery of the economy  activity levels in the real estate market  real estate inventory coming into the market for sale and collateral asset class 
oreo is likely to remain elevated as nonperforming commercial real estate loans continue to move through the collection process

table of contents foreclosed real estate oreo totaled million at december   compared to million at december   and is comprised of properties 
the increase in oreo properties from year end reflects our efforts to move problem loans through the credit management collection process by means of foreclosure or other resolution strategy to gain control of the real estate collateral for ultimate sale 
given current economic conditions and the difficult real estate market  the time required to sell these properties in an orderly fashion has increased  and oreo is likely to remain elevated as nonperforming commercial real estate loans continue to move through the collection process 
oreo is recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan at the time of acquisition or the fair value  determined on the basis of current appraisals  comparable sales  and other estimates of value obtained principally from independent sources  adjusted for estimated selling costs 
updated appraisals on oreo are typically obtained every twelve months and evaluated internally at least every six months

credit quality management and allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents an accounting estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information at that time 
the allowance is not a prediction of our actual credit losses going forward based on current and available information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships that are considered to be impaired the specific component of the allowance  as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified the general allocated component of the allowance  which is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors and management judgment applied to defined segments of our loan portfolio 
the specific component of the allowance relates to impaired loans 
impaired loans consist of nonaccrual loans which include nonaccrual tdrs and loans classified as accruing tdrs 
a loan is considered nonaccrual when  based on current information and events  management believes that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due both principal and interest according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement 
all loans that are over days past due in principal or interest are by definition considered impaired and placed on nonaccrual status 
management may also place some loans on nonaccrual status before they are days past due if they meet the above definition of impaired 
once a loan is determined to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the loan s observable fair value  the fair value of the underlying collateral less selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent  or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
impaired loans exceeding  are evaluated individually while smaller loans are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience as well as management s loss expectations for the respective asset class and product type 
if the estimated fair value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan including accrued interest  net of deferred loan fees and costs and unamortized premium or discount  impairment is recognized by creating a specific reserve as a component of the allowance for loan losses 
the recognition of any reserve required on new impaired loans is recorded in the same quarter in which the transfer of the loan to nonaccrual status occurred 
all impaired loans are reviewed quarterly for any changes that would affect the specific reserve 
any impaired loan in which a determination has been made that the economic value is permanently reduced is charged off against the allowance for loan losses to reflect its current economic value in the period in which the determination has been made 

table of contents when collateral dependent real estate loans are determined to be impaired  updated appraisals are typically obtained every twelve months and evaluated internally at least every six months 
in addition  both borrower and market specific factors are taken into consideration  which may result in obtaining more frequent appraisal updates or internal assessments 
appraisals are conducted by third party independent appraisers under internal direction and engagement 
any appraisal with a value in excess of  is subject to a compliance review 
appraisals received with a value in excess of million are subject to a technical review 
appraisals are either reviewed internally or sent to an outside technical firm if appropriate 
both levels of review involve a scope appropriate for the complexity and risk associated with the loan and its collateral 
we consider other factors or recent developments which could adjust the valuations indicated in the appraisals or internal reviews 
as of december   the average appraisal age used in the impaired loan valuation process was approximately days 
the amount of impaired assets which  by policy  requires an independent appraisal  but does not have a current external appraisal at year end due to the timing of the receipt of the appraisal is not material to the overall reserve 
in situations such as this  we establish a probable impairment reserve for the account based on our experience in the related asset class and type 
the general allocated component of the allowance is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors applied to segments of our loan portfolio 
the methodology takes into account at a product level the originating line of business and vintage transformational or legacy  the origination year  the risk rating migration of the note  and historical default and loss history of similar products 
using this information  the methodology produces a range of possible reserve amounts by product type 
we consider the appropriate balance of the general allocated component of the reserve within these ranges based on a variety of internal and external quantitative and qualitative factors to reflect data or timeframes not captured by the model as well as market and economic data and management judgment 
in certain instances  these additional factors and judgments may lead to management s conclusion that the appropriate level of the reserve is outside the range determined through the framework 
in our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance at december   we considered a number of factors for each product that included  but were not limited to  the following for the commercial portfolio  the pace of growth in the commercial loan sector  the existence of larger individual credits and specialized industry concentrations  and general macroeconomic indicators such as gdp employment trends  and manufacturing activity  which overall show some signs of improvement in recent months  but still are susceptible to sustainability risk and possible negative ramifications from the european debt crisis  for the commercial real estate portfolio  the potential impact of general commercial real estate trends  particularly occupancy and leasing rate trends  charge off severity and collateral value changes  for the construction portfolio  construction employment  industry experience on construction loan losses  and construction spending rates  and for the residential  home equity  and personal portfolios  home price indices and sales volume  vacancy rates  delinquency rates and general economic conditions and interest rate trends which impact these products 
the bank has limited exposure with a related junior collateral position in any product type with the exception of home equity lines of credit helocs 
this product is by definition usually secured in the junior position to the first mortgage on the related property 
the bank evaluates the allowance for loan losses for helocs as one of our six primary  segregated product types 
default rates on our heloc portfolio have historically been below industry averages and our allowance reflects the performance and loss history unique to our portfolio 
the establishment of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment and includes an inherent level of imprecision given the difficulty of identifying all the factors impacting loan repayment and the timing of when losses actually occur 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control  including  but not limited to  client performance  the economy  changes in interest rates and property values  and the interpretation by regulatory authorities of loan classifications 
although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately and consider this process to be an important credit management tool  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and reviews the allowance for loan losses and the underlying methodology with the audit committee of the board of directors quarterly 
as of december   management concluded the allowance for loan losses was adequate ie  sufficient to absorb losses that are inherent in the portfolio at that date  including those not yet identifiable 
as an integral part of their examination process  various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the accounting policies underlying the establishment and maintenance of the allowance for loan losses through provisions charged to operating expense are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

also  the portfolio is becoming more weighted in transformational and commercial loans  where our historical credit performance has been better  and less weighted in legacy and commercial real estate loans  where historical performance has been weaker 
this changing mix positively impacts reserve requirements  based on our historical loss experience to date 
the allocated reserve for our commercial real estate and construction portfolios  which represented of our total allocated reserve at december   declined million  or  from december  the decrease in this allocation is primarily due to a lower balance and improved risk ratings of remaining loans in the commercial real estate and construction sectors at the end of the current year as compared to the prior year 
the combined coverage ratio of the allocated reserve for these portfolios was at december  and at december  specific component of the allowance at december   the specific component of the allowance decreased by million to million from million at december  the specific reserve requirements are primarily influenced by new loan additions to nonperforming status  as well as changes to collateral values 
our impaired loans are primarily collateral dependent with such loans totaling million of the total million in impaired loans at december  reserve for unfunded commitments in addition to the allowance for loan losses  we maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments at a level we believe to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities 
at december   our reserve for unfunded commitments declined  from december  to million as a result of an improved risk profile of the portfolio and a lower propensity to fund 
net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other non interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
unfunded commitments  excluding covered assets  totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 

table of contents covered assets covered assets represent purchased loans and foreclosed loan collateral covered under loss sharing agreements with the fdic as a result of the fdic assisted acquisition of the former founders bank from the fdic 
under the loss share agreements  the fdic generally will assume of the first million of credit losses and of the credit losses in excess of million  in both cases relating to assets existing at the date of acquisition 
the carrying amounts of covered assets as of december  and are presented in the following table table covered assets amounts in thousands december  commercial loans commercial real estate loans residential mortgage loans consumer installment and other loans foreclosed real estate assets in lieu estimated loss reimbursement by the fdic total covered assets allowance for covered loan losses net covered assets total covered assets decreased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  the reduction is primarily attributable to million in principal paydowns  net of advances  as well as the resulting impact of such on the evaluation of expected cash flows and discount accretion levels 
in addition  the estimated loss reimbursement by the fdic the fdic indemnification receivable further contributed to the reduction as a result of loss claims paid by the fdic 
the allowance for covered loan losses increased by million to million at december  from million at december   reflecting a further credit deterioration in expected cash flows on certain pools of covered loans since the date of acquisition 
of the total increase in the allowance for covered loan losses  was offset through the fdic indemnification receivable and the remaining representing the non reimbursable portion of the loss share agreement recognized as a charge to provision for loan and covered loan losses on the consolidated statements of income 
as of december   the fdic had reimbursed the company million in losses under the loss share agreements 
the following table presents covered loan delinquencies and nonperforming covered assets as of december  and and excludes purchased impaired loans which are accounted for on a pool basis 
since each purchased impaired pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows  the past due status of the pools  or that of individual loans within the pools  is not meaningful 
because we are recognizing interest income on each pool of such loans  they are all considered to be performing

table of contents funding and liquidity management we have implemented various policies to manage our liquidity position in order to meet our cash flow requirements and maintain sufficient capacity to meet our clients needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in our business operations as well as unanticipated events 
we also have in place contingency funding plans designed to allow us to operate through a period of stress when access to normal sources of funding may be constrained 
as part of our asset liability management strategy  we utilize a variety of funding sources in an effort to optimize the balance of duration risk  cost  liquidity risk and contingency planning 
the bank s principal sources of funds are client deposits  including large institutional deposits  capital contributions by the parent company  and cash from operations 
the bank s principal uses of funds include funding growth in the core asset portfolios  including loans  and to a lesser extent  our investment portfolio  which is used primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk 
the primary sources of funding for the holding company include dividends when received from its bank subsidiary  intercompany tax reimbursements from the bank  and proceeds from the issuance of senior  subordinated and convertible debt  as well as equity 
primary uses of funds for the parent company include repayment of maturing debt  interest paid to our debt holders  dividends paid to stockholders  and capital contributions to the bank 
we consider client deposits our core funding source 
at december   of our total assets were funded by client deposits  compared to at december  we define client deposits as all deposits other than traditional brokered deposits and non client cdars as described in the footnotes to table below 
while we expect overall liquidity in the banking system to remain high until economic recovery and market factors improve  the level of our client deposits may fluctuate based on client needs  seasonality and other economic or market factors 
if the client deposits fluctuate due to any of these factors  we will utilize other external sources of liquidity  including wholesale funding 
given the commercial focus of our core business strategy  a majority of our deposit base is comprised of corporate accounts which are typically larger than retail accounts 
we have built a suite of deposit and cash management products and services that support our efforts to attract and retain corporate client accounts 
thirteen client relationships  each with greater than million in deposits accounted for billion  or of total deposits at december  a majority of the deposits greater than million are from financial services related businesses  including omnibus accounts from broker dealer and mortgage companies representing underlying accounts of their customers that may be eligible for pass through deposit insurance limits 
thirty two relationships  each with greater than million in deposits  accounted for billion  or or total deposits at december  we take deposit concentration risk into account in managing our liquid asset levels 
liquid assets refer to cash on hand  federal funds sold  unpledged securities  as well as collateral based borrowing 
net liquid assets represent the sum of the liquid asset categories less the amount of assets pledged to secure public funds and certain deposits that require collateral 
net liquid assets at the bank were billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
we maintain liquidity at levels we believe sufficient to meet anticipated client liquidity needs  fund anticipated loan growth  selectively purchase securities and investments and opportunistically pay down wholesale funds 
while we first look toward internally generated deposits as our funding source  we utilize wholesale funding  including brokered deposits  as needed to enhance liquidity and to fund asset growth 
brokered deposits are deposits that are sourced from external and unrelated financial institutions by a third party 
this funding requires advance notification to structure the type of deposit desired by the bank 
brokered deposits can vary in term from one month to several years and have the benefit of being a source of longer term funding 
our asset liability management policy currently limits our use of brokered deposits  excluding reciprocal cdars  to levels no more than of total deposits  and total brokered deposits to levels no more than of total deposits 
at december   brokered deposits exclusive of reciprocal cdars were less than of total deposits while total brokered deposits were of total deposits 
our cash flows are comprised of three classifications cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities  and cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities primarily include results of operations for the year  adjusted for items in net income that did not impact cash 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million from to million for  which was primarily due to an increase in net income from the prior year 
cash flows from investing activities reflect the impact of loans and investments acquired for our interest earning asset portfolios and asset sales 
for  net cash used in investing activities was million  compared to million for the prior year 
this change in cash flows represents larger amounts of cash redeployed towards investments and loans in the prior year than the current year 
cash flows from financing activities include transactions and events whereby cash is obtained from depositors  creditors or investors 
net cash used in financing activities for was million  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the prior year 
this change in cash flows represents the decrease in total deposits in the current year as compared to the prior year 

table of contents deposits middle market commercial client relationships from a diversified industry base in our markets are the primary source of our deposit base 
due to our middle market commercial banking focused business model  our client deposit base provides access to larger deposit balances that result in a concentrated deposit base 
the deposits are held in different deposit products such as interest bearing and noninterest bearing demand deposits  cdars  savings and money market accounts 
the following table provides a comparison of deposits by category over the last three years

these deposits are classified as brokered deposits for regulatory deposit purposes  however  we classify certain of these deposits as client cdars due to the source being our client relationships and are  therefore  not traditional brokered deposits 
we also participate in a non client cdars program that is more like a traditional brokered deposit program 
total deposits  net of traditional brokered deposits and non client cdars 
total deposits at december  decreased by million from year end as money market accounts  non client cdars  and traditional brokered deposits declined  partially offset by increased balances in noninterest bearing deposits 
client deposits increased by million from december  and client deposits as a percentage of total deposits also increased from at december  to almost all deposits at december  we anticipate client deposits to fluctuate in line with client needs and usage of liquidity 
noninterest bearing deposits grew to billion at december   an increase of compared to one year ago 
the increase in noninterest bearing deposits can be attributed to several factors including growth from existing and new commercial client relationships  client focused treasury management product offerings  and deposit movements 
table of contents reflecting our clients desire to hold greater liquidity in this economic environment  as well as temporary unlimited insurance coverage on these types of accounts 
from december  through december   all noninterest bearing deposits  with the exception of negotiable order of withdrawal accounts  are fully insured by the fdic 
in response to the provision of the dodd frank act requiring repeal of the regulatory prohibition on payment of interest on commercial demand deposits effective in july  we began offering an interest bearing checking account for business customers in the third quarter of as anticipated  this change did not have a material effect on our deposit mix or our cost of funds in the low rate environment 
brokered deposits totaled million at december   decreasing million from december  due to a reduced reliance on traditional brokered deposits and non client cdars deposits 
brokered deposits at december  included million in client related cdars 
brokered deposits  excluding client cdars  declined by million from the prior year end and were less than of total deposits at december  compared to at december  consistent with our funding needs  during  we elected not to replace certain maturing non client cdars and traditional brokered deposits as total loans remained relatively flat and we continued to see client deposit inflows 
public balances  denoting the funds held on account for municipalities and other public entities  are included as a part of our total deposits 
we enter into specific agreements with certain public customers to pledge collateral  primarily securities  in support of the balances on account 
these relationships may provide cross sell opportunities with treasury management  as well as other business referral opportunities 
at december   we had public funds on account totaling million  of which less than were collateralized with securities 
year to year changes in balances are influenced by the tax collection activities of the various municipalities as well as the general level of interest rates

table of contents over the past several years in the generally low interest rate environment  our clients have tended to keep the maturities of their deposits short and short term certificates of deposit have generally been renewed on terms and with maturities of similar duration 
in the event that time deposits are not renewed  we expect to replace those deposits with traditional deposits  brokered deposits  or borrowed money sufficient to meet our funding needs 
short term borrowings and long term debt short term borrowings  which at december  consisted solely of fhlb advances that mature in one year or less  totaled million  increasing by million from million at december   due to increases in short term fhlb advances from the prior year 
the year over year increase is attributable to the reclassification from long term debt as advances approach maturity

in addition to on balance sheet funding and other liquid assets such as cash and investment securities  we maintain access to various external sources of funding  which assist in the prudent management of funding costs  interest rate risk  and anticipated funding needs or other considerations 
some sources of funding are accessible same day while others require advance notice 
funds that are immediately accessible include federal fund counterparty lines  which are uncommitted lines of credit from other financial institutions  and the borrowing term is typically overnight 
availability of federal fund lines fluctuate based on market conditions and counterparty relationship strength 
unused overnight fed funds borrowings available for use totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and repurchase agreements repos are also an immediate source of funding in which we pledge assets to a counterparty against which we can borrow with the agreement to repurchase at a specified date in the future 
repos can vary in term  from overnight to longer  but are regarded as short term in nature 
an additional source of overnight funding is the discount window at the frb 
we maintain access to the discount window by pledging loans as collateral to the frb 
funding 
table of contents availability is primarily dictated by the amount of loans pledged  but also impacted by the margin applied to the loans by the frb 
the amount of loans pledged to the frb can fluctuate due to the availability of loans eligible under the frb s criteria which include stipulations of documentation requirements  credit quality  payment status and other criteria 
at december   we had billion in borrowing capacity through the frb discount window s primary credit program compared to million at december  to increase our access to liquidity  during  we became a member of the fhlb chicago  establishing access to additional fhlb borrowing capacity of million at december  refer to notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional details regarding the junior subordinated debentures and subordinated debt facility 
contractual obligations  commitments  off balance sheet risk  and contingent liabilities through our normal course of operations  we have entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments 
such obligations generally relate to the funding of operations through deposits or debt issuances  as well as leases for premises and equipment 
as a financial services provider  we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit 
while contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process as all comparable loans we make 
the following table presents our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and significant commitments as of december  which are expected to come due and payable during the period specified

purchase obligations exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
our operating lease obligations represent short and long term lease and rental payments for facilities  equipment  and certain software or data processing 
purchase obligations at december  reflect the minimum obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional information and disclosure related to uncertain tax positions 
due to the recent uncertainties with regard to european sovereign debt holdings  particularly those countries experiencing significant economic  fiscal or political strains  there are concerns regarding the risks to financial institutions as a result of direct and indirect exposures to european sovereign and non sovereign debt holdings 
as it relates to our investment portfolio  we had no direct funded or non funded exposure to european sovereign or non sovereign entities in either our held to maturity or available for sale portfolios as of december  however  we conduct business with european financial institutions headquartered in the united kingdom  switzerland  france  and germany  related to repurchase agreements  interest rate swaps  balance sheet hedging  foreign exchange transactions and letter of credit issuance 
as is common market practice  certain of our interest rate derivatives and letter of credit transactions with such european financial institutions including their us branches and subsidiaries are collateralized with approximately million of investment securities at december  the interest rate derivative transactions are subject to master netting and collateral support agreements which significantly limit the company s exposure to loss as they generally require daily posting of collateral 
at december   the company was in a net payable position to each of these european banks 
we also maintained cash balances with various european financial institutions in the aforementioned countries to support our foreign exchange business 
as of december   we do not have any outstanding borrowings under lines for repurchase agreements 
the company may have direct or indirect exposure to foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of united states us domiciled commercial clients 
those entities may be co borrowers or guarantors of the us parent s credit facilities with the company  and in some cases collateral consisting of assets or stock of those entities may be pledged to the company to secure payment and performance of those credit facilities 
in most cases however  the underwriting and credit decision is based on the performance of the us alone

capital issuances we did not have any common or preferred stock offerings in either or capital management under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  the company and the bank are subject to various capital requirements adopted and administered by the federal banking agencies 
these guidelines specify minimum capital ratios calculated in accordance with the definitions in the guidelines  including the leverage ratio which is tier capital as a percentage of adjusted average assets  and the tier capital ratio and the total capital ratio each as a percentage of risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items that have been weighted according to broad risk categories 
these minimum ratios are shown in the table below 
to satisfy safety and soundness standards  banking institutions are expected to maintain capital levels in excess of the regulatory minimums depending on the risk inherent in the balance sheet  regulatory expectations and the changing risk profile of business activities and plans 
under our capital planning policy  we target capital ratios at levels we believe are appropriate based on such risk considerations  taking into account the current operating and economic environment  internal risk guidelines  and our strategic objectives as well as regulatory expectations 
at the bank  primarily due to our credit loss experience and recent levels of nonperforming loans  our policy currently calls for minimum capital ratios of tier leverage and total risk based capital 
we have not set a timetable for repaying tarp funds but are continuing to evaluate the best timing and approach for the shareholders and the company

the dividend payout ratio  which represents the percentage of dividends declared to stockholders to earnings per share  was for we have no current plans to seek to raise dividends on our common stock 

table of contents as a result of our participation in the tarp cpp  prior to january   we were subject to various restrictions on our ability to increase the cash dividends we pay on our common stock above the quarterly rate of per share  the rate in effect when our participation in tarp cpp began 
although this restriction is no longer applicable  we still may not pay dividends on our common stock unless we have paid dividends on our outstanding preferred stock  including the cpp preferred stock  and non voting common stock 
in addition  we currently provide notice to and obtain approval from the frb before declaring or paying any dividends

stock repurchase program our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock is subject to the applicable restrictions of the cpp following the sale of the preferred stock to the treasury under the tarp program 
please refer to eesa in supervision and regulation of item of this form k for additional discussion of the cpp and tarp programs 
in connection with restrictions on stock repurchases as part of the cpp  we terminated our repurchase program in february the restrictions on repurchases will not affect our ability to repurchase shares in connection with the administration of our employee benefit plans  as such transactions are in the ordinary course and consistent with our past practice 
during  we repurchased  shares with an average value of per share with all repurchases associated with shares submitted in satisfaction of taxes and or exercise price amounts in connection with the settlement of share based compensation awards 
impact of inflation our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry 
under these principles and practices  we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
for analysis of our sensitivity to changes in interest rates  refer to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section at item a of this form k 
non us gaap financial measures this report contains both us gaap and us gaap based financial measures 
these non us gaap financial measures include net interest income  net interest margin  net revenue  operating profit  and efficiency ratio all on a fully taxable equivalent basis  tier common equity to risk weighted assets  tangible common equity to tangible assets  tangible equity to risk weighted assets  tangible equity to tangible assets  and tangible book value 
we believe that presenting these non us gaap financial measures will provide information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance  our business  and performance trends and facilitates comparisons with the performance of others in the banking industry 
we use net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis in calculating various performance measures by increasing the interest income earned on tax exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments assuming a tax rate 
management believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it enhances comparability to net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources  and accordingly believes that providing this measure may be useful for peer comparison purposes 
in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators  we also consider various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy  including tier common equity to risk weighted assets  tangible common equity to tangible assets  tangible equity to tangible assets  tangible equity to risk weighted assets  and tangible book value 
these calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes 
all of these measures exclude the ending balances of goodwill and other intangibles while certain of these ratios exclude preferred capital components 
because us gaap does not include capital ratio measures  we believe there are no comparable us gaap financial measures to these ratios 
we believe these non us gaap financial measures are relevant because they provide information that is helpful in assessing the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions 
additionally  presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of our capitalization to other companies 
however  because there are no standardized definitions for these ratios  our calculations may not be comparable with other companies  and the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited 

table of contents non us gaap financial measures have inherent limitations  are not required to be uniformly applied  and are not audited 
although these non us gaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company  they have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under us gaap 
as a result  we encourage readers to consider our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure

critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments based on information available at the date of the financial statements that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions  and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
our most significant accounting policies are presented in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the notes to consolidated financial statements of item of this form k 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other consolidated financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that our accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes and fair value 
table of contents measurements are the accounting areas requiring subjective or complex judgments that are most important to our financial position and results of operations  and  as such  are considered to be critical accounting policies  as discussed below 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents an accounting estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information at that time 
the allowance consists of provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships that are individually evaluated for impairment the specific component  as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio that are not specifically identified the general allocated component  which is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors applied to segments of our loan portfolio as well as management s judgment 
the specific component relates to impaired loans 
impaired loans consist of nonaccrual loans which include nonaccrual tdrs and loans classified as accruing tdrs 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  management believes that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due both principal and interest according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement 
once a loan is determined to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the loan s observable fair value  fair value of the underlying collateral less selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent  or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  impairment is recognized by creating a specific valuation reserve as a component of the allowance for loan losses 
impaired loans exceeding  are evaluated individually  while loans less than  are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience  as well as management s loss expectations  for the respective asset class and product type 
impaired loans with specific reserves are reviewed quarterly for any changes that would affect the specific reserve 
any impaired loan for which a determination has been made that the economic value is permanently reduced is charged off against the allowance for loan losses to reflect its current economic value in the period in which the determination has been made 
at the time a collateral dependent loan is initially determined to be impaired  we review the existing collateral appraisal 
if the most recent appraisal is greater than a year old  a new appraisal is obtained on the underlying collateral 
appraisals for loans in excess of  are updated with a new independent appraisal at least annually and are formally reviewed by our internal appraisal department upon receipt of a new appraisal as well as at the six month interval between the independent appraisals 
all impaired loans and their related reserves are reviewed and updated each quarter 
if during the course of the six month review period there is evidence supporting a meaningful decline in the value of collateral  a new appraisal is required to support the value of the impaired loan 
with an immaterial number of exceptions  all appraisals and internal reviews are current under this methodology at december  to determine the general allocated component of the allowance for loan losses  we segregate loans by originating line of business and vintage transformational and legacy for reserve purposes because of observable similarities in the performance experience of loans underwritten by these business units 
in general  loans originated by the business units that existed prior to the strategic changes of the company in are considered legacy loans 
loans originated by a business unit that was established in connection with or following the strategic business transformation plan are considered transformational loans 
renewals or restructurings of legacy loans may continue to be evaluated as legacy loans depending on the structure or defining characteristics of the new transaction 
the company has implemented a line of business model that has reorganized the legacy business units so that after  all new loan originations are considered transformational 
the methodology produces an estimated range of potential loss exposure for the product types within each originating line of business 
we consider the appropriate balance of the general allocated component of the reserve within these ranges based on a variety of internal and external quantitative and qualitative factors to reflect data or timeframes not captured by the basic allowance framework as well as market and economic data and management judgment 
in certain instances  these additional factors and judgments may lead to management s conclusion that the appropriate level of the reserve is outside the range determined through the basic allowance framework 
determination of the allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires significant estimates  including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  risk ratings  product type  and vintage  as well as consideration of current economic trends and portfolio attributes  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses  which is a charge against earnings  is recorded to bring the allowance for 
table of contents loan losses to a level that  in management s judgment  is appropriate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the acquisition method of accounting 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset  or liability 
goodwill is allocated to reporting units at acquisition 
subsequently  goodwill is not amortized but  instead  is tested at the reporting unit level at least an annually for impairment or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
in the event that we conclude that all or a portion of our goodwill may be impaired  a noncash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded in earnings 
such a charge would have no impact on tangible or regulatory capital 
the impairment testing process is conducted by assigning net assets and goodwill to each reporting unit 
in step one  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the recorded book value 
our step one calculation of each reporting unit s fair value is based upon a simple average of two metrics a primary market approach  which measures fair value based upon trading multiples of independent publicly traded financial institutions of comparable size and character to the reporting units  and an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon discounted cash flows dcf and terminal value using the perpetuity growth method 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not considered impaired and step two is not considered necessary 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the impairment test continues step two by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined using the residual approach  where the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit  calculated in step one  is the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
goodwill impairment testing is considered a critical accounting estimate as estimates and assumptions are made about future performance and cash flows  as well as other prevailing market factors 
for our annual impairment testing  we engage an independent valuation firm to assist in the computation of the fair value estimates of each reporting unit as part of its impairment assessment 
in connection with obtaining an independent third party valuation  management provides certain information and assumptions that are utilized in the dcf and implied fair value calculations 
assumptions critical to the process include forecasted cash flows  which are developed for each segment by considering several key business drivers such as historical performance  forward interest rates using forward interest rate curves to forecast future expected interest rates  anticipated loan and deposit growth  and industry and economic trends  discount rates  and credit quality assessments  among other considerations 
we provide the best information available at the time to be used in these estimates and calculations 
in our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of october   the company determined that the trust and investments reporting unit passed the fair value exceeded the carrying amount step one of the goodwill impairment test  while the banking reporting unit failed step one of the impairment test 
as a result of the step one procedures performed  the banking reporting unit s adjusted net book value exceeded its fair value by approximately million 
however  the company determined that no goodwill impairment charge was necessary based on the implied fair value adjustments of the banking reporting unit s assets and liabilities determined in the step two valuation procedures 
as a result of the step two procedures performed  the implied fair value of the banking reporting unit s goodwill exceeded its carrying amount by approximately million 
identified intangible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over that life in a manner that reflects the estimated decline in the economic value of the identified intangible asset and are subject to impairment testing whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
during  there were no events or circumstances to indicate that there may be impairment of intangible assets 
all of the other intangible assets have finite lives which are amortized over varying periods not exceeding years and include core deposit premiums  client relationship  and assembled workforce intangibles  which are amortized on a straight line basis 
income taxes the determination of income tax expense or benefit  and the amounts of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on complex analyses of many factors  including interpretation of federal and state income tax laws  current financial accounting standards  the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities temporary differences  assessments of the likelihood that the reversals of deferred deductible temporary differences will yield tax benefits  and estimates of reserves required for tax uncertainties 
in addition  for interim reporting purposes  management generally determines its income tax provision  exclusive of any discrete items  based on its current best estimate of pre tax income  permanent differences and the resulting effective tax rate expected for the full year 
we are subject to the federal income tax laws of the united states and the tax laws of the states and other jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we periodically undergo examination by various governmental taxing authorities 
such authorities may require that changes in the amount of tax expense be recognized when their interpretations of tax law differ from those of management  based on 
table of contents their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions  new interpretations of existing law or positions by federal or state taxing authorities  will not result in tax liability amounts that differ from our current assessment of such amounts  the impact of which could be significant to future results 
temporary differences may give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities  which are recorded on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods based on weighing both positive and negative evidence and establish a valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets for which recovery is unlikely  based on a standard of more likely than not 
in making this assessment  we must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize these assets through a the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  b future taxable income  c the possible application of future tax planning strategies  and d carryback to taxable income in prior years 
we have not established a valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax assets at december  however  there is no guarantee that the tax benefits associated with these deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
we have concluded  as of december   that it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will be realized 
in the preparation of income tax returns  tax positions are taken based on interpretation of federal and state income tax laws for which the outcome of such positions may not be certain 
we periodically review and evaluate the status of uncertain tax positions and may establish tax reserves for tax benefits that may not be realized 
the amount of any such reserves are based on the standards for determining such reserves as set forth in current accounting guidance and our estimates of amounts that may ultimately be due or owed including interest 
these estimates may change from time to time based on our evaluation of developments subsequent to the filing of the income tax return  such as tax authority audits  court decisions or other tax law interpretations 
there can be no assurance that any tax reserves will be sufficient to cover tax liabilities that may ultimately be determined to be owed 
at december   we had  of tax reserves established relating to uncertain tax positions that would favorably affect the company s effective tax rate if recognized in future periods

fair value measurements certain of the company s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value at each reporting date  including securities available for sale  derivatives  and certain loans held for sale 
additionally  other assets are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates  including goodwill and other intangible assets  assets acquired in business combinations  impaired loans  and oreo 
the company measures fair value in accordance with us gaap  which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
us gaap establishes a fair value hierarchy that categorizes fair value measurements based on the observability of the valuation inputs used in determining fair value 
level valuations are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets 
level valuations are based on quoted prices for similar instruments  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level valuations use at least one significant unobservable input that is supported by little or no market activity 
judgment is required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are included in level or level when making this judgment  we consider all available information  including observable market data  indications of market liquidity and orderliness  and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used 
classification of level or level is based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of the level inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety 
if level inputs are considered significant  the instrument is classified as level judgment is also required when determining the fair value of an asset or liability when either relevant observable inputs do not exist or available observable inputs are in a market that is not active 
when relevant observable inputs are not available  the company must use its own assumptions about future cash flows and appropriately risk adjusted discount rates 
conversely  in some cases observable inputs may require significant adjustments 
for example  in cases where the volume and level of trading activity in an asset or liability have declined significantly  the available prices vary significantly over time or among market participants  or the prices are not current  the observable inputs may not be relevant and could require adjustment 
valuation techniques and models used to measure the fair value of financial instruments on a recurring basis are reviewed and validated by the company on at least a quarterly basis 
the company uses a variety of methods to validate the overall reasonableness of the fair values obtained from external sources  including evaluating pricing service inputs and methodologies  using exception 
table of contents reports based on analytical criteria  comparing prices obtained to prices received from other pricing sources  and reviewing the reasonableness of prices based on company knowledge of market liquidity and other market related conditions 
the company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants 
however  the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs can affect the amount of income or loss recorded for a particular position 
additional information regarding fair value measurements is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a continuing part of our financial strategy and in accordance with our asset liability management policies  we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income 
this effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk  credit risk  liquidity risk and maintenance of yield 
our asset liability management policies also authorize us to enter into derivative instruments as a tool to further manage the interest rate exposure of the bank s balance sheet 
we may manage interest rate risk by structuring the asset and liability characteristics of our balance sheet and or by executing derivatives designated as accounting hedges 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
there are other factors that are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our consolidated statements of income 
in july  we initiated the use of interest rate derivatives as part of our asset liability management strategy to hedge interest rate risk in our primarily floating rate loan portfolio and  depending on market conditions  we may expand this program and enter into additional interest rate swaps 
the majority of our interest earning assets are floating rate instruments 
to manage the interest rate risk of our balance sheet  we have the ability to use a combination of financial instruments  including medium term and short term financings  variable rate debt instruments  fixed rate loans and securities and interest rate swaps 
approximately of the total loan portfolio is indexed to libor  of the total loan portfolio is indexed to the prime rate  and another of the total loan portfolio otherwise adjusts with other reference interest rates 
of the billion in loans maturity after one year with a floating interest rate  are subject to interest rate floors under the terms of the loan agreements  the majority of which are in effect at december  and are reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis below 
changes in market rates and the shape of the yield curve may give us the opportunity to make changes to our investment securities portfolio as part of our asset liability management strategy 
we use a simulation model to estimate the potential impact of various interest rate changes on our income statement and our interest earning asset and interest bearing liability portfolios  assuming the size and nature of these portfolios remain constant throughout the twelve month measurement period 
the simulation assumes that assets and liabilities accrue interest on their current pricing basis 
assets and liabilities then re price based on current terms and assuming instantaneous parallel shifts in the applicable yield curves and remain at that new interest rate through the end of the measurement period 
the model attempts to illustrate the potential change in annual net interest income if the foregoing occurred 
the following table shows the estimated impact of an immediate change in interest rates as of december  and analysis of net interest income sensitivity dollars in thousands immediate change in rates december  dollar change percent change december  dollar change percent change the estimated impact to our net interest income over a one year period is reflected in dollar terms and percentage change 
as an example  this table illustrates that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points on december  
table of contents  net interest income would increase by million  or  over a twelve month period  as compared to a net interest income increase of million  or  if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift of basis points at december  changes in the effect on net interest income at december  compared to december  are due to changes in the composition and nature of the repricing of interest rate sensitive assets relative to rate sensitive liabilities since year end interest rate sensitivity increased during due to several factors  primarily liability compositional changes 
non interest sensitive deposits increased while rate sensitive deposits  such as money market deposits  decreased 
rate sensitive liabilities mitigate rate sensitive assets 
accordingly  as rate sensitive liabilities decrease  less asset sensitivity is offset by the liabilities as a whole 
taken together  the asset composition was more rate sensitive than in the prior year  and less of the asset sensitivity was mitigated by rate sensitive liabilities  producing an overall increase in asset sensitivity 
this effect was partially mitigated by the hedging program established in the preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others 
while our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change
