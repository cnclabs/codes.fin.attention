table of contents part i item business overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the potential further development of our maxy g product candidate  a next generation pegylated  granulocyte colony stimulating factor  or g csf  for the treatment of chemotherapy induced neutropenia and acute radiation syndrome  or ars 
in may  a subsidiary of astellas pharma inc  or astellas  acquired all of our interests in perseid therapeutics llc  or perseid  for million in cash 
perseid  a former majority owned subsidiary  included substantially all of our research and development operations and personnel 
as a result of the acquisition of perseid by astellas  we have no further interests or obligations with respect to the business and operations of perseid  except for the ongoing technology license agreement between the companies entered into as a part of the joint venture arrangement or as otherwise provided under the purchase agreement 
at december   we held approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and remain eligible for a contingent payment of up to million from bayer healthcare llc  or bayer  related to the sale of our hematology assets to bayer in july our strategy the acquisition of perseid by astellas largely completed a multi year strategic process to maximize stockholder value through sales  distributions and other arrangements involving our various assets 
in july  we sold our hematology assets  including maxy vii  our factor viia program  to bayer 
in september  we consummated the joint venture transaction with astellas that resulted in its acquisition of perseid in may in january  we sold our vaccine related assets  including the related government grants to altravax  inc  or altravax  a privately held biopharmaceutical company 
in october  we sold the patents and other intellectual property rights associated with the molecular breeding directed evolution platform to codexis  inc  or codexis 
in december  we distributed substantially all of the shares of codexis  inc common stock we held  together with approximately million in cash  to our stockholders by way of pro rata special distributions that were classified as a return of capital to our stockholders for us federal income tax purposes 
in addition  from december through december   we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
we retain all rights to our maxy g program for development of all therapeutic areas  including the chemotherapy induced neutropenia and ars indications  and our current focus is to create value from this program for our stockholders  either through the potential further development of the product candidate for one or both indications  or through a sale  licensing  partnering or other transaction involving the program 
we also continue to evaluate potential strategic options for our company as a whole  including a strategic business combination  other transaction  or a wind down of the company 
as noted above  we have previously distributed cash and property to our stockholders and have repurchased our common stock under various stock repurchase programs 
we also have a current stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to purchase up to million of our common stock through december  in addition  given that we continue to have large cash reserves  we expect to consider and evaluate additional distributions to our stockholders of a portion of our cash resources in excess of our current and longer term operational requirements  although none are currently contemplated 
such distributions may be accomplished through cash dividends  stock repurchases or other mechanisms and may be fully or partially taxable depending on the circumstances of such distribution 
if appropriate opportunities become available  we may also consider and evaluate using a portion of our cash reserves to acquire additional businesses  assets  technologies  or products 
our plans with respect to any future distributions or acquisitions will be largely 
table of contents dependent upon whether we receive the contingent payment from bayer  any future developments related to our maxy g program  including any potential government funding for the program  and the future financial commitments and longer term operational requirements related to our remaining assets 
we currently have eight employees  all of whom are engaged in general and administrative activities  and we have significantly curtailed our operations and decreased our operating expenses 
however  we expect our operating expenses to increase if we engage in any further development of our maxy g program or pursue any strategic combination or other transactions 
our assets maxy g our maxy g product candidate has been designed to be an improved next generation pegylated  g csf for the treatment of chemotherapy induced neutropenia 
g csf is a natural protein that functions by stimulating the body s bone marrow to produce more white blood cells 
chemotherapy induced neutropenia neutropenia is a severe decrease in neutrophil cell counts in the blood and is a common side effect of chemotherapeutic treatments for many forms of cancer  including breast cancer  lung cancer  lymphomas and leukemias 
neutropenic patients are at increased risk of contracting bacterial infections  some of which can be life threatening 
further  and most importantly  neutropenic patients may receive reduced or delayed chemotherapy treatment  which can result in cancer progression 
neupogen  a first generation g csf product  and neulasta  a second generation pegylated g csf product  currently dominate the market to treat chemotherapy and radiation induced neutropenia 
worldwide sales of neupogen and neulasta were approximately billion in in december  we completed a phase iia clinical trial for our maxy g product candidate for the treatment of chemotherapy induced neutropenia in breast cancer patients in which maxy g was safe and effective in reducing chemotherapy induced neutropenia with no serious adverse events  drug related grade or adverse events or immunogenicity reported in any patient receiving maxy g adverse events were consistent with known side effects of g csf molecules 
in october  we made the decision to delay both phase iii manufacturing activities and the planned phase iib clinical trial of our maxy g program until we could identify a partner who would share these costs 
the phase iii manufacturing activities were anticipated to begin in september  and the delay of these activities will likely have a material impact on any potential future development and commercialization timeline for the maxy g program for the chemotherapy induced neutropenia indication 
our original schedule called for the phase iib trial to begin in the second half of to date  we have not identified a suitable partner for this program for chemotherapy induced neutropenia 
in addition  we believe that a us patent issued to amgen inc  or amgen  in with certain claims to mutated g csf molecules patent no 
 has also made it more difficult for us to secure a collaborative or other arrangement for our maxy g program 
in particular  amgen s patent includes certain claims to mutated granulocyte colony stimulating factor g csf molecules that potentially cover our maxy g product candidate 
in  we submitted a request to the united states patent and trademark office  or pto  for an inter partes reexamination of the amgen patent and  in october  the pto issued a right of appeal notice in the proceeding that included a final rejection of all claims in the amgen patent 
amgen has appealed the decision to the pto s board of patent appeals and interferences and we cannot predict the outcome of this appeal or any further proceedings related to the inter partes reexamination of amgen s patent 
as a result  there can be no assurances that we will ultimately prevail  that we will be able to secure a partnership or other arrangement for 
table of contents our maxy g program  or that we or a third party will be able to recommence development activities and be successful in the development and commercialization of the maxy g program  even if we are successful in the reexamination process 
acute radiation syndrome g csf products such as our maxy g product candidate may also have potential application in the treatment of ars  an acute illness caused by irradiation of the entire body by a high dose of penetrating radiation in a very short period of time 
a significant portion of the funding for the treatment of ars to date has come from various government entities for the development of therapeutics as a medical countermeasure to nuclear terrorism and other radiological emergencies 
in may  we submitted a proposal to barda for the development of our maxy g product candidate as a potential medical countermeasure for ars 
the submission was in response to a broad agency announcement baa sol under which barda sought to fund the advanced research and development of potential treatments for the sub syndromes associated with ars  including neutropenia 
in november  barda advised us that our proposal would not be considered for a contract award and indicated in a subsequent notification received in january that its decision with respect to our proposal was primarily based on barda s availability of funding 
barda also has encouraged us to continue to engage with barda and indicated that our maxy g program would be reconsidered by barda if the circumstances related to its funding availability changed in the future 
we will continue to evaluate our plans for the maxy g program in light of this development 
however  there can be no assurances that the circumstances related to barda s funding availability will change  that barda will open a future solicitation applicable to the maxy g program or ars  or that we would submit a proposal for  or be awarded a contract under  any potential future barda solicitation or other government funded programs 
we continue to retain all rights to the maxy g program for commercial development of all therapeutic areas  including all rights for chemotherapy induced neutropenia and ars indications  and our current focus is to create value from this program for our stockholders  either through the potential further development of the product candidate for one or both indications  or through a sale  licensing  partnering or other transaction involving the program 
contingent payment from bayer healthcare llc in july  we sold our hematology assets  including maxy vii  our factor viia program  and granted certain licenses to the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform to bayer for an upfront cash payment of million 
under the technology transfer agreement with bayer  we remain eligible to receive future cash payments of up to an additional million based on the achievement of certain events related to the potential initiation by bayer of a phase ii clinical trial of maxy vii 
the milestone payment is also subject to the satisfaction of certain patent related conditions  with half of the potential million milestone payment subject to the satisfaction of certain patent related conditions in the united states and the remaining half of the potential milestone payment subject to the satisfaction of similar patent related conditions in certain european countries 
to date  all of the patent related conditions have been satisfied 
however  there can be no assurances that these conditions will remain satisfied at the time of the achievement of the events related to the potential initiation of the phase ii clinical trial  if it occurs 
the failure to satisfy these patent related conditions at that time could reduce the potential milestone payment by  or  or could result in no payment of the potential milestone payment 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december   we held approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we currently maintain an investment portfolio primarily consisting of money market funds and us treasury securities and have not experienced any liquidity issues to date with respect to these securities 

table of contents recent asset sales and distributions as noted above  we have substantially completed a multi year strategic process to maximize stockholder value through the sales  distributions or other arrangements involving our various assets 
a summary of our recent asset sales and distributions is provided below 
acquisition of perseid therapeutics llc by astellas on may   we entered into a unit purchase agreement with astellas bio inc  or bio  a wholly owned subsidiary of astellas  and perseid  pursuant to which bio acquired all of our equity interests in perseid for million in cash 
the purchase agreement included customary representations  warranties and covenants of bio and us 
perseid began operations on september   in connection with the consummation of the joint venture transaction between astellas and us pursuant to which we contributed substantially all of our protein pharmaceutical programs and related assets  together with million in cash  to perseid 
astellas also invested million in perseid 
as part of the joint venture arrangement  astellas was granted an option to acquire all of our ownership interest in perseid at specified exercise prices that were to increase each quarter from million to million over the term of the option  which was scheduled to expire on september  the third anniversary of the closing 
astellas exercised its option on march  at the million option price in effect on the date of exercise 
as a result of the consummation of the purchase agreement  perseid has become a wholly owned subsidiary of astellas  and we have no further interests or obligations with respect to the business and operations of perseid  except for the ongoing technology license agreement between the companies entered into as a part of the joint venture arrangement or as otherwise provided under the purchase agreement 
the various agreements among perseid  astellas  bio and us that governed the relationship between the parties as joint venture partners and investors in perseid  including the master joint venture agreement  the investors rights agreement  the co sale agreement and the voting agreement  automatically terminated upon the consummation of the purchase agreement 
sale of platform technology to codexis in october  we consummated an asset purchase agreement with codexis pursuant to which codexis acquired substantially all of the patents and other intellectual property rights associated with the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform 
the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform consisted of an extensive patent portfolio relating to recombination based directed molecular evolution technologies  specialized screening technologies  and the application of these technologies to the development of protein pharmaceuticals and other industries  including agriculture  vaccines  gene therapy and chemicals 
the assets acquired by codexis include patents  trademarks  copyrights  software and certain assumed contracts 
the intellectual property assets and rights acquired by codexis continue to be subject to existing license rights previously granted by us to third parties 
see intellectual property and licensing arrangements licensing arrangements below 
in consideration for the assets acquired by codexis under the purchase agreement and the termination of our prior license agreement with codexis  codexis paid a total purchase price to us of million 
we received million in cash upon closing of the sale in october  with the remaining million held in escrow  million of which was released in november and million of which will be held in escrow until at least september to satisfy any of our indemnification obligations under the purchase agreement 

table of contents distribution of codexis stock to our stockholders we formed codexis in january as a wholly owned subsidiary to operate our former chemicals business 
codexis received financing from third party investors and operated as an independent subsidiary beginning in september and  in april  codexis completed an initial public offering of its common stock 
at the time of the codexis initial public offering  we held approximately million shares  or approximately  of the outstanding common stock of codexis 
in december  we completed the distribution of substantially all of the shares of codexis  inc common stock we owned to our stockholders 
as a result of the distribution  each of our stockholders received of a share of codexis  inc common stock for each outstanding share of our common stock such stockholder held as of the december  record date  subject to a due bill process for shares of our common stock traded between the record date and the december  ex dividend date 
our stockholders also received cash in lieu of any fraction of a codexis share that they would have otherwise received in the distribution 
in aggregate  we distributed  shares of codexis  inc common stock to our stockholders valued at approximately million based on the closing price of the codexis  inc common stock on the date of distribution 
the remaining  shares of codexis  inc common stock we held at december  represent shares that are being retained by us on behalf of the holders of certain outstanding equity awards  fractional shares of codexis  inc common stock for which we instead made a cash payment to our stockholders in lieu thereof  and shares required to be withheld under applicable tax laws 
because we had no current or cumulative earnings and profits for tax purposes in  the distribution was treated as a tax free return of capital to our stockholders for us federal income tax purposes 
sale of vaccines assets to altravax in january  we consummated a transaction with altravax  a privately held biopharmaceutical company  for the sale of substantially all of our vaccine related assets  including the related government grants 
under the arrangement and in consideration for the assets sold to altravax  we received payments totaling approximately million  including an upfront payment of  in january  a second payment of  in december  and a final payment of  in july we also remain eligible to receive a percentage of certain payments that may be received by altravax relating to the vaccines technology through july two years after the final payment by altravax 
prior to the sale of our vaccine assets to altravax  our vaccine research program included an active program to advance the research for development of a preventative hiv vaccine and was fully funded by research grants from the national institutes of health 
stock repurchases and cash distributions in december  we completed the repurchase of approximately of our outstanding common stock in a modified dutch auction tender offer for a total cost of approximately million 
in addition  since march  we have repurchased an additional  million shares of our common stock under an open market repurchase program and in private transactions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in december  together with our distribution of codexis  inc common stock to our stockholders  we also made a special cash distribution in the amount of for each outstanding share of our common stock owned on the december  record date  equal to approximately million in the aggregate 
in january  we announced a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to purchase up to an additional million of our common stock through december  given that we continue to have large cash reserves  we may continue to consider and evaluate additional distributions to our stockholders of a portion of our cash resources in excess of our current and longer term operational requirements  although none are currently contemplated 
such distributions may be accomplished through cash dividends  stock repurchases or other mechanisms and may be fully or partially taxable depending on the circumstances of such distribution 

table of contents intellectual property and licensing arrangements patents and intellectual property patents are very important to us in establishing proprietary rights to our maxy g program and we attempt to protect our intellectual property position by filing  prosecuting and maintaining united states and foreign patents and patent applications that we believe are important to the continued development of our maxy g program 
our patent portfolio currently includes granted or issued patents and pending applications directed to our maxy g product candidate 
we have generally sought claims directed to compositions of matter  as well as methods of using such compositions 
our issued patents will expire between and in the united states and europe 
patents expire  on a country by country basis  at various times depending on various factors  including the filing date of the corresponding patent application s  the availability of patent term extension and supplemental protection certificates and terminal disclaimers 
the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
in addition  limitations on patent protection in countries outside the united states  and the differences in what constitutes patentable subject matter in these countries  may limit the protection we have on patents issued to us outside the united states 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the patents granted to us will afford adequate legal protection against competitors or provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantage 
we may not be able to develop a patentable product or obtain patents from pending patent applications 
even if patent claims are allowed  the claims may not issue 
in the event of issuance  the patents may not be sufficient to protect the proprietary technology owned by us 
our current patents  or patents that issue on pending applications  may be challenged  invalidated  infringed or circumvented 
our patents have been and may in the future be challenged by third parties in post issuance administrative proceedings or in litigation as invalid or unenforceable under us or foreign laws  or they may be infringed by third parties 
in addition  competitors or potential competitors  as well as universities and research institutions  may have filed patent applications or received patents  and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to proteins  small molecules  compounds  or processes that are competitive with or cover our maxy g product candidate 
as a result  we are  or may be  from time to time involved in the defense and enforcement of our patents or other intellectual property rights in a court of law  pto interference or reexamination proceeding  foreign opposition proceeding or related legal and administrative proceeding in the united states and elsewhere 
for example  in  a us patent issued to amgen with certain claims to mutated g csf molecules patent no 
 that potentially cover our maxy g product candidate 
in  we submitted a request to the pto for an inter partes reexamination of the amgen patent and  in october  the pto issued a right of appeal notice in the proceeding that included a final rejection of all claims in the amgen patent 
amgen has appealed the decision to the pto s board of patent appeals and interferences and we cannot predict the outcome of this appeal or any further proceedings related to the inter partes reexamination of amgen s patent 
as a result  there can be no assurances that we will ultimately prevail  that we will be able to secure a partnership or other arrangement for our maxy g program  or that we or a third party will be able to recommence development activities and be successful in the development and commercialization of the maxy g program  even if we are successful in the reexamination process 
in addition to our patented intellectual property  we also rely on trade secrets and other confidential information 
our policy is to require each of our employees  consultants and advisors to execute a confidential information and inventions assignment agreement before beginning their employment  consulting or advisory relationship with us 
these agreements provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances 
these agreements also provide that we will own all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us 
despite these precautions  third parties or former employees could obtain and use information regarding our technologies without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
it is difficult for us to monitor unauthorized use of our proprietary 
table of contents methods and information 
effective protection of intellectual property rights is also unavailable or limited in some foreign countries 
the efforts that we take to protect our proprietary information and rights may be inadequate to protect such information and rights 
our competitors could independently develop similar technology or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
licensing arrangements codexis in october  we sold substantially all of the patents and other intellectual property rights associated with the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform  including patents  trademarks  copyrights  software and certain assumed contracts  to codexis 
the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform consisted of an extensive patent portfolio relating to recombination based directed molecular evolution technologies  specialized screening technologies  and the application of these technologies to the development of protein pharmaceuticals and other industries  including agriculture  vaccines  gene therapy and chemicals 
prior to our sale of these intellectual property rights to codexis  we granted exclusive and non exclusive licenses to this platform technology to various third parties  including license grants to codexis for certain small molecule pharmaceutical  energy and industrial chemical applications 
our original license agreement with codexis was entered into by the parties in connection with the formation of codexis in march under that agreement  we were entitled to receive a significant portion of certain consideration received by codexis from a third party licensee in connection with the commercialization of energy products made with a biocatalyst developed using the licensed technology 
we were also eligible for a royalty on net sales of any related energy product commercialized directly by codexis 
during and  we recognized approximately million and million  respectively  in revenue from codexis under that license agreement 
this revenue reflects amounts due to us from payments received by codexis under its collaboration arrangement with shell that began in november and an expanded collaboration agreement between royal dutch shell plc and codexis for the development of new enzymes to convert biomass to fuel 
since codexis acquired substantially all of the intellectual property rights that were subject to this license agreement  we agreed to terminate this original license agreement and  as a result  we are no longer eligible for any payments or potential royalties from codexis 
in connection with the intellectual property assets acquired by codexis  we entered into a new license agreement with codexis  pursuant to which codexis granted us certain license rights to the intellectual property assets acquired by codexis to the extent necessary for us to fulfill our contractual obligations under the license agreements we retained and to permit us to practice any retained rights under such agreements 
as described further below  these include licenses to perseid to perform discovery  research  development  manufacture and commercialization of proteins and products containing proteins for the prevention  treatment or management of human diseases or conditions  to bayer in the fields of hematology  cardiovascular and women s healthcare  and to altravax in the vaccines and adjuvants fields 
the license agreement also provides for a grant by us of certain license rights to codexis  including rights necessary for codexis to fulfill its contractual obligations under the license agreements it has assumed under the purchase agreement 
perseid therapeutics llc as part of our joint venture arrangement with astellas  we granted a license to perseid to certain assets and proprietary technologies  including assets and technologies related to the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform  regulated read through  cmv promoters and other protein modification technology  to perform discovery  research  development  manufacture and commercialization of proteins and products containing proteins for the prevention  treatment or management of human diseases or conditions 
the licenses are exclusive with respect to the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform and other program specific technology related to the research and development programs transferred from us to perseid and non exclusive with respect to other licensed technology  in each case  subject to existing third party rights to such licensed assets and technology 

table of contents bayer healthcare llc in connection with the acquisition by bayer of our maxy vii program and other hematology assets  we entered into a license agreement with bayer 
subject to the exclusive rights retained by us and other restrictions described below  the license agreement provides bayer a nonexclusive  non sublicensable license to use the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform and ancillary protein expression technologies  including use in biopharmaceuticals 
in addition  bayer s license to use the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform will be exclusive until july  for specific proteins in the fields of hematology  cardiovascular and women s healthcare 
under the license agreement  we have also retained exclusive rights to use the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform until july  for specific proteins that include proteins in the immune suppression and autoimmunity fields  as well as our maxy g program 
in addition  under the license agreement  bayer is prohibited from using the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform for various applications that have been excluded from the scope of the license 
these excluded uses include applications related to vaccines  immunomodulators and certain small molecule discovery applications  as well as areas that have been exclusively licensed by us to third parties under existing agreements or are now licensed to such third parties directly by codexis  such as agricultural and chemical applications 
bayer is also prohibited from using its licensed rights to the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform in a fee for service arrangement with any third party 
we also entered into an intellectual property cross license agreement with bayer to provide for a license by us to bayer of certain intellectual property rights retained by us that relate to the hematology assets acquired by bayer and to provide for a license from bayer back to us to certain intellectual property rights acquired by bayer for use by us outside of the hematology field 
altravax as part of the sale of our vaccine assets to altravax in january  we granted altravax certain exclusive licenses in the vaccines field and certain non exclusive licenses in the adjuvants field to the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform and certain ancillary technologies  in each case  subject to existing third party rights to such licensed assets and technology 
manufacturing we have relied on third party manufacturers and collaborators to produce our compounds for certain preclinical and clinical purposes and may do so for any future preclinical and clinical purposes and for commercial production of any drug candidates that are approved for marketing 
competition any products that we develop will compete in highly competitive markets 
with regard to our maxy g product candidate  we would expect neulasta and neupogen to compete with maxy g in chemotherapy induced neutropenia  if commercialized 
in addition  given the limited remaining terms of the patents covering neulasta and neupogen  we would also expect to face competition from biologic generics ie bioequivalent protein drugs  generic biologicals and biogenerics and are aware that teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
and sandoz international gmbh are currently developing biologic generic g csf products to compete in this market 
many of our potential competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  have substantially greater financial  technical and personnel resources than we do  and there can be no assurance that they will not succeed in developing technologies and products that would render our technologies and products or those of a collaborator obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  many of our competitors have significantly 
table of contents greater experience than we do in developing products  undertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials  obtaining the approval of the us food and drug administration  or fda  and other regulatory approvals of products  and manufacturing and marketing products 
research and development expenses the majority of our operating expenses to date have been related to research and development 
our research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to research and development expenses in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
operations our operations are based in the united states  however  certain of our former collaborators and licensees have been based outside the united states 
additional information required by this item is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and incorporated herein by reference 
government regulation we are subject to regulation by the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries with respect to any development and commercialization of our maxy g product candidate or any other products we may acquire in the future 
the fda and comparable regulatory bodies in other countries currently regulate therapeutic proteins and related pharmaceutical products as biologics 
biologics are subject to extensive pre and post market regulation by the fda  including regulations that govern the collection  testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  potency  labeling  storage  record keeping  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of the products 
the time required for completing testing and obtaining approvals of our product candidates is uncertain but will take several years  and approvals will only be obtained if a product candidate is shown to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials 
any delay in testing may hinder product development 
in addition  we may encounter delays in product development or rejections of product applications due to changes in fda or foreign regulatory policies during the period of product development and testing 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements may subject us to  among other things  civil penalties and criminal prosecution  restrictions on product development and production  suspension  delay or withdrawal of approvals  and the seizure or recall of products 
the lengthy process of obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any delay or failure by us to obtain regulatory approvals could adversely affect our ability to commercialize product candidates and generate sales revenue 
such delays or failures could also impact our likelihood of receiving any milestone or royalty payments under any potential future collaborative or licensing arrangement 
under fda regulations  the clinical testing program required for marketing approval of a new drug typically involves three sequential phases  which may overlap phase i studies are conducted in normal  healthy human volunteers or patients to determine safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion 
if possible  phase i studies may also be designed to gain early evidence of effectiveness 
phase ii studies are conducted in small groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage  to gain preliminary evidence of efficacy  and to determine the common short term side effects and risks associated with the substance being tested 
phase iii involves large scale studies conducted in disease afflicted patients to provide statistical evidence of efficacy and safety and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling 

table of contents to date  neither we nor any third party collaborator or licensee has successfully completed all stages of clinical development for our maxy g product candidate or any of our former product candidates 
if we or a third party collaborator or licensee are unable to continue or successfully commence  continue or complete clinical trials of our maxy g product candidate or any other products we may acquire in the future  or decide not to continue clinical trials for a particular indication  we will not be able to seek or obtain regulatory approval for commercialization of the applicable product candidate for the relevant indication 
phase i  phase ii or phase iii clinical testing may not be completed successfully within any specific period of time  if at all  with respect to any of our potential products 
furthermore  an institutional review board  the fda or other regulatory bodies may deny approval for conducting a clinical trial or temporarily or permanently suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
fda marketing approval is only applicable in the united states 
marketing approval in foreign countries is subject to the regulations of those countries 
the approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional testing 
the requirements for approval and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required for fda approval 
although there are some centralized procedures for filings in the european union countries  in general each country has its own procedures and requirements  and compliance with these procedures and requirements may be expensive and time consuming 
accordingly  there may be substantial delays in obtaining required approvals from foreign regulatory authorities after the relevant applications are filed  if approvals are ultimately received at all

we have implemented a substantial restructuring of our operations  which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 
in may  a subsidiary of astellas pharma inc  or astellas  acquired our interests in perseid therapeutics llc  or perseid  a former majority owned subsidiary that included substantially all of our research and development operations and personnel 
the acquisition of perseid by astellas largely completed a multi year strategic process to restructure our operations  a process that also included the sale or distribution of various other assets  such as our vaccines assets  the patent rights relating to the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform  and substantially all of the shares of codexis  inc common stock we held 
as a result  it may be difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects or to assess future operating performance on the basis of historical operating performance 
our future prospects may be highly dependent on our ability to consummate a strategic transaction for the further development of our maxy g product candidate or a strategic business combination or other transaction for our company 
our current non financial assets primarily consist of our maxy g product candidate  a granulocyte colony stimulating factor  or g csf 
we are currently evaluating the potential further development of our maxy g program for chemotherapy induced neutropenia and acute radiation syndrome  or ars  and continue to evaluate potential strategic options for our company as a whole  including a strategic business combination  other transaction or a wind down of the company 
we may also evaluate or make additional cash distributions to our stockholders of a portion of our cash resources and evaluate the potential acquisition of additional businesses  assets  technologies  or products or we may pursue other strategic transactions 
our financial assets currently consist of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  and we remain eligible for a contingent payment of up to million from bayer related to the sale of our hematology assets to bayer in july however  there can be no assurance that we can commence or successfully continue the further development of our maxy g program for any indication  that we will make any additional cash distributions to our stockholders  that we will pursue or be able to successfully consummate any particular strategic transaction  or that we will receive any portion of the event based payment from bayer 
in addition  we may implement a course of action or consummate a transaction that yields unexpected results that adversely affects our business and decreases the remaining cash available for use in our business or the execution of our strategic plan 
the process of continuing to evaluate  and potentially executing  one or more of these strategic options may be very costly and time consuming and may distract our management and otherwise disrupt our operations  which could have adverse effects on our business 
as a result  there can be no assurances that any particular course of action  business arrangement or transaction  or series of transactions  will be pursued  successfully consummated or lead to increased stockholder value 
furthermore  we have incurred  and may in the future incur  significant costs related to the execution of our strategic plan  such as legal and accounting fees and expenses and other related charges  and we may also incur additional unanticipated expenses in connection with this strategic plan 
a considerable portion of these costs will be incurred regardless of whether any such course of action is implemented or transaction is completed 
these expenses will decrease the remaining cash available for use in our business or the execution of our strategic plan 
the prospects for further development and commercialization of our maxy g product candidate are highly uncertain 
we continue to evaluate the further clinical development and potential commercialization of maxy g for the treatment of both chemotherapy induced neutropenia and ars 
however  we previously suspended manufacturing and development activities for our maxy g product candidate for the treatment of 
table of contents chemotherapy induced neutropenia in due to the potential cost of such development and have not identified a suitable partner or other source of external funding for development of this program 
our suspension of manufacturing and development activities will likely have an adverse impact on the timeline for any potential commercialization of maxy g for chemotherapy induced neutropenia  which will likely make it more difficult for us to secure a collaborative or other arrangement to fund the further development of this product candidate and could limit the commercial potential of maxy g  if commercialized 
the existence of any issued patents and pending patent applications that claim certain g csf compositions and their use  such as the us patent issued to amgen in with certain claims to mutated g csf molecules  could also make it more difficult for us to secure a collaborative or other arrangement for maxy g litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our maxy g product candidate could further delay or materially impact the ability to commercialize maxy g and may also absorb significant management time 
accordingly  there can be no assurances that we will enter into a collaborative or other arrangement with a third party to fund the further development of maxy g for the chemotherapy induced neutropenia indication 
even if we are able to enter into a collaborative or other arrangement with a third party to fund the further development and commercialization of maxy g and this product candidate successfully completes clinical trials and is approved for marketing in the united states or other countries  it will need to compete with other g csf drugs then on the market 
the ability of maxy g to be successful in the market will depend on a variety of factors  including  for example  whether maxy g is clinically differentiated from other g csf drugs  the scope and limitations of the label approved by regulators for the use of maxy g  the price of maxy g  reimbursement decisions by third parties with regard to maxy g  the approval and sale of any generic or bioequivalent forms of g csf products  such as neulasta and neupogen  in the united states  and the effort and success of marketing activities undertaken with regard to maxy g we have also been seeking the government funding for the development of this program for the ars indication and  in may  we submitted a proposal to the biomedical advanced research and development authority  or barda  for the development of this product candidate as a potential medical countermeasure for ars 
however  in november  our proposal was rejected by barda primarily due to barda s availability of funding 
although barda indicated that our maxy g program would be reconsidered by barda if the circumstances related to its funding availability changed in the future  there can be no assurances that the circumstances related to barda s funding availability will change  that barda will open a future solicitation applicable to the maxy g program or ars  or that we would submit a proposal for  or be awarded a contract under  any potential future barda solicitation or any other government funded program 
the rejection of our proposal by barda significantly impaired our ability to successfully commence or continue any further development of our maxy g program or realize any value from this program 
absent a collaborative or other arrangement  we will further delay or cease development of maxy g for this indication  which could adversely affect our ability to realize any value from this program 
if we are not able to consummate a strategic transaction for our maxy g product candidate or our company  we may discontinue the development of maxy g and fail to realize any value from this program  and we may decide to wind down our operations 
our current focus is to create value from our maxy g program for our stockholders  either through the potential further development of the product candidate for one or both indications  or through a sale  licensing  partnering or other transaction involving the program 
we also continue to evaluate potential strategic options for our company as a whole  including a strategic business combination or other transaction 
however  each such strategy is subject to numerous risks and we may fail to properly execute our chosen strategy 
if we are unable  or choose not to  further develop our maxy g program or consummate a strategic transaction for this program or for our company as a whole  we may discontinue the development of maxy g and fail to realize any value from this program 
we may also choose to wind down the company  which may be a lengthy process  yield 
table of contents unexpected results and delay any potential distributions to our stockholders 
such process may also require the further expenditure of company resources  which would decrease the amount of resources available for distributions to our stockholders 
if we do not retain key employees  our ability to maintain our ongoing operations or execute a potential strategic option could be impaired 
as of march   we had eight employees and we will rely heavily on the services of our existing employees to manage our ongoing operations and execute our strategic plans 
the loss of services from any of our existing employees could substantially disrupt our operations 
to be successful and achieve our objectives under our revised corporate strategy  we must retain qualified personnel 
our recent restructurings and the continued review of our strategic options may create continued uncertainty for our employees and this uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees and to hire new talent necessary to maintain our ongoing operations or to execute additional potential strategic options  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our current strategy and any changes to this strategy could place significant strain on our resources and our ability to maintain our ongoing operations 
we may also be required to rely more heavily on temporary or part time employees  third party contractors and consultants to assist with managing our operations 
in particular  we have relationships with consultants who assist us in formulating and executing our research  development  regulatory  clinical strategies  as well as certain operational matters 
these consultants are not our employees and may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to us 
we will have only limited control over the activities of these consultants and can generally expect these individuals to devote only limited time to our activities 
failure of any of these persons to devote sufficient time and resources to our business could harm our business 
in addition  these advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products that may compete with our products 
accordingly  we may fail to maintain our ongoing operations or execute our strategic plan if we are unable to retain or hire qualified personnel or to manage our employees and consultants effectively 
any attempts to grow our business could have an adverse effect on the company 
because of our small size  we may need to grow rapidly in order to execute certain strategic options  such as the further development of our maxy g program or the potential acquisition of additional businesses  assets  technologies  or products 
to the extent that rapid growth is necessary  it would place a significant strain on our financial  technical  operational and administrative resources 
such growth would result in increased responsibility for both existing and new management personnel and effective growth management would depend upon our ability to integrate new personnel  expand our operations and to train  motivate and manage our employees 
if we were unable to manage growth effectively  our business and our ability to execute a potential strategic option could be materially and adversely affected 
we may make additional distributions to our stockholders of a portion of our cash resources  which may restrict our funds available for other actions and negatively affect the market price of our securities 
in december  we distributed substantially all of the shares of codexis  inc common stock we held  together with approximately million in cash  to our stockholders 
in addition  since december  we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for a total cost of approximately million  and we are currently conducting a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to purchase up to an additional million of our common stock through december  in addition  given that we continue to have large cash reserves  our board of directors may consider and evaluate additional distributions to our stockholders of a portion of our cash resources in excess of our current and longer term operational requirements  although none are currently contemplated 
such distributions may be accomplished through cash dividends  stock repurchases or other mechanisms and may be fully or partially taxable depending on the circumstances of such distribution 
any such distribution may not have the effects anticipated by our board of 
table of contents directors and may instead harm the market price and liquidity of our securities 
the full implementation of any additional distribution could use a significant portion of our remaining cash reserves  and this use of cash could limit our future flexibility to operate our business  invest in our existing assets  complete acquisitions of businesses or technologies  or pursue other transactions 
in addition  the implementation of certain distribution mechanisms  such as stock repurchases  could also result in an increase in the percentage of common stock owned by our existing stockholders  and such increase may trigger disclosure or other regulatory requirements for our larger stockholders 
as a result  these stockholders may liquidate a portion of their holdings  which may have a negative impact on the market price of our securities 
furthermore  repurchases of stock may affect the trading of our common stock to the extent we fail to satisfy continued listing requirements of the exchange on which our stock trades  including those based on numbers of holders or public float of our common stock 
under certain circumstances  stock repurchases could impact our ability to utilize certain tax benefits  including net operating losses 
any stock repurchases would also reduce the number of shares of our common stock in the market  which may impact the continuation of an active trading market in our stock  causing a negative impact on the market price of our stock 
any future development of our maxy g product candidate  which is based on modifications to a natural human protein  may be subject to substantial delays  increased development costs  reduced market potential for any resulting product or the termination of the development program  which could adversely affect our business 
we have designed our maxy g product candidate to confer what we believe will be improved biological properties as compared to currently marketed products 
as a result  maxy g differs from currently marketed drugs in ways that we expect will be beneficial 
however  the impact of the modifications we have made may not be fully apparent in initial testing and may only be discovered in later stage testing 
such altered properties may render maxy g unsuitable or less beneficial than expected for one or more diseases or medical conditions of possible interest or make the product candidate unsuitable for further development 
for example  the product candidate may be found to be more immunogenic than the corresponding natural human proteins or demonstrate undesirable pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties 
this may lead to the redirection of the development strategy which could result in substantial delays  increased development costs  decreased likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval  and reduced market potential for any resulting product 
this also could result in the termination of the development of the product candidate 
in either case  such results could adversely affect our business 
in addition  we or a future licensee or collaborator  if any  may determine that maxy g or any future preclinical or clinical product candidates or programs do not have sufficient therapeutic or commercial potential to warrant further advancement for a particular indication or all indications  and may elect to terminate a program for such indications or product candidates at any time 
our assessment of the commercial potential for a product may change significantly from the time when we invest in discovery and development to the time when the product either reaches the market or reaches clinical development stages that require investment at risk 
commercial potential can change due to many factors beyond our control  such as general economic conditions  the qualitative and quantitative properties of medical reimbursement schemes at the time  the legal status for sale of biologic generics ie bioequivalent protein drugs  generic biologicals and biogenerics  and the financial status of potential partner companies 
as commercial potential decreases  the ability or interest of other parties to share the costs of further development of our products may decrease  thus precluding advancement of our products 
furthermore  we may conclude that a product candidate is not differentiated in a meaningful way from existing products  or that the costs of seeking to establish that a product candidate is differentiated would be prohibitive  or that the market size for a differentiated product with the attributes of a particular product candidate does not justify the expense and risk of further development 
if we terminate our maxy g program  or any potential future preclinical or clinical program in which we have invested significant resources  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected  as we will have expended resources on a program that will not provide a return on our investment and we will have missed the opportunity to have allocated those resources to potentially more productive uses 

table of contents if we engage in any acquisitions  we will incur a variety of costs and may potentially face numerous risks that could adversely affect our business and operations 
as part of our ongoing strategic evaluation  we may acquire additional businesses  assets  technologies  or products in the future if appropriate opportunities become available 
in connection with any future acquisitions  we could use a significant portion of our cash resources to fund and manage the acquisitions  issue additional equity securities which would dilute our current stockholders  incur substantial debt to fund the acquisitions  or assume significant liabilities 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including problems integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs and other liabilities  diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  adverse effects on existing business relationships with current and or prospective collaborators  customers and or suppliers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees 
we do not have extensive experience in managing the integration process  and we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  assets  products  technologies  or personnel that we might acquire in the future without a significant expenditure of operating  financial and management resources  if at all 
the integration or management process could divert management time from focusing on operating our business  result in a decline in employee morale and cause retention issues to arise from changes in compensation  reporting relationships  future prospects or the direction of the business 
acquisitions may also require us to record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  and incur large and immediate write offs and restructuring and other related expenses  all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we may acquire companies that have insufficient internal financial controls  which could impair our ability to integrate the acquired company and adversely impact our financial reporting 
if we fail in our integration or management efforts with respect to any of our acquisitions  our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 
in addition  any acquisition of a business  asset  technology or product could require us to use significantly more cash reserves than initially expected or in excess of the cash reserves actually required for our current and longer term operational requirements  and this use of cash could limit our future flexibility to operate our business  invest in our existing assets  complete acquisitions of businesses or technologies  or pursue other transactions 
we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future and will continue to incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company 
we currently expect that our operating expenses  including costs associated with operating as a public company  will exceed our revenues  if any  for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we may incur increased expenses in connection with any research and development activities for our maxy g program and in connection with any potential strategic transaction for the program or our company 
these operating expenses will decrease the remaining cash available for use in our business or the execution of our strategic plan 
any inability to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our competitive position 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property for our maxy g program and any future products in the united states and other countries 
if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may be able to erode our competitive advantage 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights in these foreign countries 
these problems can be caused by  for example  a lack of rules and processes allowing for meaningfully defending intellectual property rights 

table of contents we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the patent positions of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including our patent positions  are often uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we have applied for patents covering maxy g as we deem appropriate 
however  we may not obtain patents on all inventions for which we seek patents  and any patents we obtain may be challenged and may be narrowed in scope or extinguished as a result of such challenges 
our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
enforcement of our patents against infringers could require us to expend significant amounts with no assurance that we would be successful in any litigation 
others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products or design around our patented technologies or products 
in addition  we may fail to effectively prosecute or maintain certain patent rights or others may challenge or invalidate our patents  in which case our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantages 
we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information 
we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information 
these measures may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees  collaborators and consultants 
nevertheless  employees  collaborators or consultants may still disclose or misuse our proprietary information  and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
in addition  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend time and money and could require us to shut down some of our operations 
our ability to develop products depends in part on not infringing patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  and not breaching any licenses that we have entered into with regard to our technologies and products 
in particular  others have obtained patents  and have filed  and in the future are likely to file  patent applications that may issue as patents that cover genes or gene fragments or corresponding proteins or peptides that we may wish to utilize to develop  manufacture and commercialize our product candidate 
there are often multiple patents owned by third parties that cover particular proteins and related nucleic acids that are of interest to us in the development of our product candidate 
to the extent that these patents  or patents that may issue in the future  cover methods or compositions that we wish to use in developing  manufacturing or commercializing our product candidate  and such use by us or on our behalf would constitute infringement of an issued valid patent claim  we would need to obtain a license from the proprietor of the relevant patent rights  which may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
our efforts to develop an improved  next generation protein pharmaceutical could lead to allegations of patent infringement by the parties that hold patents covering other versions of such protein or methods of making and using such protein 
in addition  third parties that do not have patents that currently cover our activities may obtain such patents in the future and then claim that our activities or product candidate infringe these patents 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of the time and attention of management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims or enforcing our patents or other intellectual property rights against others 
furthermore  parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to further develop  commercialize and sell products 
in addition  in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us  we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost  if at all 
in that event  we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products  or be required to cease commercializing affected products 
in particular  the existence of any issued patents and pending patent applications that claim certain g csf compositions and their use  such as the us patent issued to amgen in with certain claims to mutated g csf molecules patent no 
 could make it more difficult for us to secure a collaborative or other arrangement for our maxy g product candidate or to commercialize or otherwise realize any value from this 
table of contents product candidate 
while we are currently engaged in an inter partes reexamination of the amgen patent with the us patent office  or pto  and the pto has issued a right of appeal notice to amgen maintaining its rejection of the claims in the amgen patent  amgen is appealing this decision and any final ruling by the pto may be appealed to the us federal courts 
as a result  there can be no assurances that we will ultimately prevail or do so in a timely manner  or that we will be successful in the development  commercialization or other utilization of the maxy g program  even if we are ultimately successful in this reexamination process 
any action we take to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights  including litigation  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical personnel 
furthermore  the outcome of any action we take to protect our rights may not be resolved in our favor 
codexis acquired technology rights from us that we previously licensed to third parties and we may be subject to litigation if these rights are not effectively prosecuted  maintained or protected by codexis 
in october  we sold substantially all of the intellectual property rights and certain other assets relating to the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform to codexis 
the intellectual property portfolio we sold to codexis will continue to be subject to existing exclusive and nonexclusive licenses that we previously granted to third parties under agreements that we will remain a party to 
these existing license agreements  the related sublicenses to third party technologies and the license agreement with codexis  and the interplay between those agreements  are highly complex and rely on highly technical definitions to delineate permitted and restricted activities 
as a result of this complexity  the agreements may be subject to differing interpretations by the counterparties that could lead to disputes or litigation  including for alleged breaches or claims that our activities or the activities of a third party are not covered by the scope of the licenses 
codexis  as the owner of these intellectual property rights  has the right to control prosecution  maintenance and enforcement of these patent rights 
if codexis or an acquirer of codexis chooses not to enforce the intellectual property rights on which these licensees rely  or enforces those rights ineffectively and has them invalidated  the ability of these licensees to effectively use its licensed rights may be adversely impacted 
while we have certain rights to continue prosecution or maintenance of patent rights that codexis chooses to abandon  we may be unable to exercise these rights effectively 
while codexis is obligated to comply with the terms of these agreements and to indemnify us for certain losses under these agreements  any action or omission by codexis that causes us to breach any of our obligations under these agreements may subject us to liability and  to the extent indemnification by codexis is not available  we may be required to pay damages to such third party 
any such litigation may divert management time from focusing on business operations and could cause us to spend significant amounts of money 
if such litigation were to be decided adversely to us  we could be required to pay monetary damages 
our manufacturing strategy  which relies on third party manufacturers  exposes us to additional risks 
we do not currently have the resources  facilities or experience to manufacture maxy g or any future product candidates or potential products ourselves 
completion of any clinical trials or other studies and any commercialization or other utilization of our products will require access to  or development of  manufacturing facilities that meet us food and drug administration  or fda  standards or other regulatory requirements to manufacture a sufficient supply of our potential products 
we would depend on a third party for the scale up and manufacture of our maxy g product candidate for any preclinical or clinical purposes 
if our third party manufacturer is unable to manufacture preclinical or clinical supplies in a timely manner  or is unable or unwilling to satisfy our needs or the requirements of the fda or other regulatory requirements  it could delay clinical trials  regulatory submissions and development  commercialization or other utilization of maxy g or any future potential products  entail higher costs and possibly result in our being unable to sell our products 
in addition  technical problems or other manufacturing delays could delay the advancement of potential products into preclinical or clinical trials  delay or prevent us from achieving development milestones under a collaborative agreement or result in the termination of development of maxy g or any future product candidates  adversely affecting our revenues and product development timetable  which in turn could adversely affect our business and our stock price 

table of contents there are a limited number of contract manufacturers that are suitable for the manufacture of protein pharmaceuticals in compliance with current good manufacturing practices gmp requirements  and there is often limited access to such facilities 
if we are unable to enter into agreements with qualified manufacturers that will provide us with sufficient supply of a product candidate in a timely manner and at an acceptable cost  the development  commercialization or other utilization of the potential product could be delayed  which would adversely affect our business 
in addition  failure of any third party manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations  including pre or post approval inspections and the current gmp requirements of the fda or other comparable regulatory agencies  could result in sanctions being imposed on us 
these sanctions could include fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of a product  delay  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  product seizures or recalls  operational restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business 
the manufacturing of our maxy g product candidate presents technological  logistical and regulatory risks  each of which may adversely affect our business 
the manufacturing and manufacturing process development of pharmaceuticals  and  in particular  biologicals  are technologically and logistically complex and heavily regulated by the fda and other governmental authorities 
the manufacturing and manufacturing process development of our maxy g product candidate presents many risks  including  but not limited to  the following before we can obtain approval of any of our product candidate for the treatment of a particular disease or condition  we must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fda and other governmental authorities that the drug manufactured for commercial use is comparable to the drug manufactured for clinical trials and that the manufacturing facility complies with applicable laws and regulations  it may not be technically feasible to scale up an existing manufacturing process to meet demand or such scale up may take longer than anticipated  and failure to comply with strictly enforced gmp regulations and similar foreign standards may result in delays in product approval or withdrawal of an approved product from the market 
any of these factors could delay any preclinical studies  clinical trials  regulatory submissions  commercialization or other development of maxy g or any future product candidates  entail higher costs and result in our being unable to effectively sell any products 
we have relied on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and our clinical trials 
if we continue the development of maxy g or any future product we may acquire and these third parties do not perform as contractually required or expected  we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates  or we may be delayed in doing so 
we do not currently have the resources  personnel or facilities to independently conduct preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates  and therefore have relied on third parties  such as contract research organizations  medical institutions  academic institutions  clinical investigators and contract laboratories  to conduct many of our preclinical studies  assist us in designing our clinical trials  prepare documents for submission to regulatory authorities  obtain regulatory approval to conduct clinical trials  enroll qualified patients  conduct and maintain our clinical trials  and analyze the results of such trials 
we are responsible for confirming that our preclinical studies are conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol 
the fda requires us to comply with regulations and standards  commonly referred to as good laboratory practices  or glp  for conducting and recording the results of our preclinical studies and good clinical practices for conducting  monitoring  recording and reporting the results of clinical trials  to assure that data and reported results are accurate and that the clinical trial participants are adequately protected 
our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities 

table of contents if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties  do not meet expected deadlines  fail to comply with the fda s glp regulations  do not conduct clinical trials in accordance with the approved protocol and regulatory requirements  or are unable to manage the conduct of any clinical trials effectively in compliance with fda and other regulatory requirements  it could adversely impact the results obtained in such preclinical studies or clinical trials or require us to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties  all of which could extend  delay or terminate the progress or completion of preclinical studies  clinical trials  regulatory submissions and commercialization or other use of maxy g or any potential future products 
in any such case  we may be affected by increased costs and delays or both  which may harm our business 
our maxy g product candidate and any potential future product candidates could take a long time to complete all phases of development  may fail during any stage of development  or may never gain approval  which could reduce or eliminate our revenue by delaying or terminating the potential commercialization of our product candidates 
the conduct of preclinical studies  clinical trials and other studies for a single product candidate is a time consuming  expensive and uncertain process and typically requires years to complete 
our maxy g product candidate and any potential future product candidates may produce undesirable toxicities and adverse effects in preclinical studies 
such toxicities or adverse effects could delay or prevent the filing of an ind with respect to such product candidate or potential product candidates 
in clinical trials  administering any of our product candidates to humans may produce undesirable toxicities or side effects 
these toxicities or side effects could interrupt  delay  suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates and could result in the fda or other regulatory authorities denying approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications 
indications of potential adverse effects or toxicities which may occur in clinical trials and which we believe are not significant during the course of such trials may later turn out to actually constitute serious adverse effects or toxicities when a drug has been used in large populations or for extended periods of time 
our maxy g product candidate previously completed a phase iia clinical trial in breast cancer patients for the treatment of chemotherapy induced neutropenia and although maxy g has demonstrated desirable properties in preclinical testing and in early clinical testing  the results from preclinical testing in vitro and animal models  as well as early clinical trials  often are not predictive of results obtained in larger later stage clinical trials 
as a result  there can be no assurances that clinical trials or other studies of maxy g or any future product candidates will be completed or produce sufficient safety and efficacy data necessary to obtain regulatory approval 
in addition  the timing of the commencement  continuation or completion of clinical trials or other studies may be subject to significant delays  or a clinical trial may be suspended or delayed by us  a collaborator  the fda or other foreign governmental agencies for various reasons  including deficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trials  negative or inconclusive results from the clinical trials that necessitate additional clinical studies  difficulties or delays in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria  delays in obtaining or maintaining required approvals from institutions  review boards or other reviewing entities at clinical sites  inadequate supply or deficient quality of product candidate materials necessary for the conduct of the clinical trials  the occurrence of unacceptable toxicities or properties or unforeseen adverse events  especially as compared to currently approved drugs intended to treat the same indications  our lack of financial resources to continue the development of a product candidate  future legislation or administrative action or changes in fda policy or the policy of foreign regulatory agencies during the period of product development  clinical trials and fda regulatory review  or other reasons that are internal to the business of a collaborative partner  which it may not share with us 

table of contents as a result of these risks and other factors  we may conduct lengthy and expensive preclinical studies  clinical trials or other studies of maxy g and any future product candidates  only to learn that a particular product candidate has failed to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy necessary to obtain regulatory approval for one or more therapeutic indications  has failed to demonstrate relevant differentiation of our products from currently marketed products  does not offer therapeutic or other improvements compared to other marketed drugs  has unforeseen adverse events or does not otherwise demonstrate sufficient potential to make the commercialization or other utilization of the product worthwhile 
any failure or substantial delay in successfully completing clinical trials or animal model studies  obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing our product candidates could severely harm our business 
our maxy g product candidate and any potential future products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process and may never gain approval 
if our potential products are not approved  we or our collaborative partners will not be able to commercialize those products 
the fda must approve any therapeutic product before it can be marketed in the united states 
other countries also require approvals from regulatory authorities comparable to the fda before products can be marketed in the applicable country 
before we can file a biologic license application bla with the fda or other regulatory entity  the product candidate must undergo extensive testing which can take many years and require substantial expenditures 
data obtained from such testing may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
regulatory approval of a bla is never guaranteed  and the approval process may take several years and is extremely expensive 
the fda and other regulatory agencies also have substantial discretion in the drug approval process 
despite the time and expense exerted  failure can occur at any stage  and we could encounter problems that would cause us to abandon trials or to repeat or perform additional such trials 
the number and focus of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for approval from the fda and other regulatory agencies varies depending on the drug candidate  the disease or condition that the drug candidate is designed to address  and the regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate 
the fda and other regulatory agencies can delay  limit or deny approval of a drug candidate for many reasons  including a drug candidate may not be safe or effective  regulatory officials may not find the data from preclinical testing and clinical trials sufficient  the fda and other regulatory agencies might not approve our third party manufacturer s processes or facilities  or the fda or other regulatory agencies may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations 
even if we receive regulatory approval to sell a product  the approved label for a product may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which we can market a product 
for example  even if maxy g is further developed for the treatment of chemotherapy induced neutropenia and approved by the fda  if we are not able to obtain broad labeling for this product allowing approved use with multiple chemotherapy regimens for multiple cancers  maxy g may not be adopted by hospital formularies or otherwise have limited commercial success which could have a significant adverse impact on our business 
further  once regulatory approval is obtained  a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continued review  and discovery of previously unknown problems or adverse events associated with an approved product or the discovery of previously unknown problems with the manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product  the manufacturer or the manufacturing facility  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
in certain countries  regulatory agencies also set or approve prices 
during the period while we are engaged in product development  the policies of the fda and foreign regulatory entities may change and additional government laws or regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates 
if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we might not obtain approval of our products or be permitted to market our products 
we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative 
table of contents action  either in the united states or abroad 
in this regard  legislation has been proposed in the united states but not yet enacted into law that would define a regulatory approval process for protein drugs that are similar to already marketed protein drugs 
we may seek to enter into arrangements to develop and commercialize our maxy g product candidate or any future products 
these arrangements  if secured  may not be successful 
since we may not possess the resources necessary to develop and commercialize products  or the resources to complete all approval processes that may be required for these potential products  we may seek to enter into collaborative or other arrangements to fund the development of maxy g or any potential future product candidates for specific indications and to develop and commercialize potential products 
we currently have no existing collaborations or other arrangements and if we are unable to enter into any new arrangements  or if existing or future arrangements are not maintained  our maxy g product candidate or any potential products may not be commercialized 
any strategic partnerships or collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies or arrangements with other third parties we may establish will be subject to a number of risks 
we have limited or no control over the resources that a third party may devote to the development and commercialization of our potential products 
such third party may elect not to develop potential products arising out of a collaborative or other arrangement or not devote sufficient resources to the development  manufacture  marketing or sale of these products 
further  such third party may not perform its obligations as expected and may delay the development or commercialization of a product candidate  terminate its agreement with us  or breach or otherwise fail to conduct its activities successfully and in a timely manner 
if any of these events occur  we may not be able to develop or commercialize our potential products 
in addition  such third party may market or otherwise seek products intended to treat the medical conditions that our product candidates are planned to be used to treat  and could become our competitors in the future 
for example  a collaborator could develop and commercialize competing products  fail to rapidly develop our product candidates  fail to obtain timely regulatory approvals for product commercialization  terminate their agreements with us prematurely  or fail to devote sufficient resources to allow the development and commercialization of our products 
any of these circumstances could harm our product development efforts 
we have limited ability to prevent actions by any such third party that could have any adverse impact on the development and commercialization of our related product candidates 
other biological products may compete with our products 
if approved for sale by regulatory authorities for chemotherapy induced neutropenia  our maxy g product candidate would likely compete with already approved earlier generation products based on the same protein 
in addition  as the patent protection for such earlier generation protein products expires  we expect that additional products with amino acid sequences identical or substantially similar to those of the earlier generation protein products that have lost patent protection will also enter the marketplace and compete with such earlier generation protein products and our products 
this competition may be intense  with success determined by product attributes  price and marketing power 
the availability of such similar products may result in price erosion for all products of the class and could lead to limits on reimbursement for our products by third party payors 
if commercialized for chemotherapy induced neutropenia  we would expect neulasta and neupogen to compete with maxy g in addition  given that the limited remaining terms of the patents covering neulasta and neupogen  we would also expect to face competition from biologic generics ie bioequivalent protein drugs  generic biologicals and biogenerics and are aware that teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
and sandoz international gmbh are currently developing biologic generic g csf products to compete in this market 
in addition  any approval of biosimilars in the united states or other foreign jurisdiction could result in increased competition for all forms of a particular therapeutic protein 

table of contents many potential competitors who have greater resources and experience than we do may develop products and technologies that make ours obsolete 
as a company that is focused on the potential development of a next generation protein therapeutic product  we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from both large and small biotechnology companies  as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies  that are pursuing competing technologies for modifying proteins 
these companies and organizations may develop technologies that are alternatives to our technologies 
further  our competitors in the protein optimization field  including companies that have developed and commercialized prior versions of protein therapeutic products  may be more effective at implementing their technologies to develop commercial products 
some of these competitors have entered into collaborations with leading companies within our target markets to produce commercial products 
in addition  therapeutic products that are small molecules may be developed by our competitors that could reduce or displace the market for our protein therapeutic products 
small molecule drugs are often less expensive and easier to administer than protein therapeutics and therefore would have competitive advantages if they were developed and shown to be safe and effective for the indication that our product candidates are targeting 
even if approved by the fda or a comparable foreign regulatory agency  any products that we develop will compete in multiple  highly competitive markets and may fail to achieve market acceptance  which would impair our ability to become profitable 
most of the companies and organizations competing with us in the markets for such products have greater capital resources  research and development and marketing staff and facilities and capabilities  and greater experience in obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing products and marketing 
accordingly  our competitors may be able to develop technologies and products more easily  which would render our products and those of a collaborator obsolete and noncompetitive 
in addition  if maxy g or any of our future drug candidates are approved for commercial sale  they will need to compete with other products intended to treat the same disease  including the marketed versions of the protein therapeutic drug that we have sought to improve  and possibly including other variant versions of such drug  and generic bioequivalent or biosimilar versions of such drugs  and small molecule drugs 
such competition may be intense and lead to price reductions for all forms of a particular therapeutic protein 
moreover  any adverse developments related to a currently marketed version of the protein therapeutic drug that we have sought to improve or a generic bioequivalent or biosimilar version of such drug may have a significant adverse impact on the continued development or future commercialization and marketing of our related product candidates and could cause us to change our development plans or discontinue further development of such product candidates 
if we are unable to market and commercialize our product successfully  our business would be adversely affected 
drug development is a long  expensive and uncertain process and may not result in the development of any commercially successful products 
the development of human therapeutic products is long and uncertain 
most product candidates fail before entering clinical trials or in clinical trials 
moreover  most products that commence clinical trials are not approved for use in humans and never reach the market 
in addition  due to the nature of human therapeutic research and development  the expected timing of product development  initiation of clinical trials and the results of such development and clinical trials are uncertain and subject to change at any point 
such uncertainty  which exists even for product candidates that appear promising based on earlier data  may result in research or development delays  clinical trial delays and failures  product candidate failures and delays in regulatory action or approval 
such delays or failures could reduce or eliminate our revenue by delaying or terminating the potential development and commercialization of our product candidates 
our maxy g product candidate and any future product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in drug development 
preclinical studies may not yield results that would satisfactorily support the filing of an investigational new drug application ind with respect to our drug candidates  and the results of preclinical studies do not necessarily predict the results of clinical trials 
moreover  the available animal models 
table of contents may be unsuitable for assessing our potential products for one or more indications  increasing the risk that animal models may not provide accurate or meaningful data as to the suitability or advantages of our potential products as treatments for the diseases or medical conditions of interest 
similarly  early stage clinical trials may not predict the results of later stage clinical trials  including the safety and efficacy profiles of any particular drug candidate 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the design of our clinical trials will result in obtaining the desired efficacy data to support regulatory approval 
even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our drug candidates are promising  such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the fda or any foreign regulatory agency  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval of our drug candidates 
the fda and similar regulatory agencies determine the type and amount of data necessary to obtain approval of any drug candidate  and as a result of new data or changes in the policies or practices of such agencies  the type and amount of data required for approval may change in the period between the start of product development and the completion of clinical trials 
any failure or substantial delay in successfully completing clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing our maxy g product candidate or any future product candidates could severely harm our business 
if we or a collaborator receives regulatory approval for maxy g or any potential future drug candidates  we will be subject to ongoing fda obligations and continued regulatory review  and we may also be subject to additional fda post marketing obligations  all of which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize our potential drugs 
any regulatory approvals that we or a collaborator receive for one of our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post marketing follow up studies 
in addition  if the fda or a foreign regulatory agency approves any of our drug candidates  the labeling  packaging  adverse event reporting  storage  advertising  promotion  and record keeping for the product will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the product  including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  may result in restriction on the marketing of the product  and could include withdrawal of the drug from the market 
we may be subject to costly product liability claims and may not have adequate insurance 
because we have conducted clinical trials in humans in the past and may conduct such trials in the future  we face the risk that the use of our product candidates will result in adverse effects 
we expect to maintain product liability insurance for any clinical trials  however  such liability insurance may not be adequate to fully cover any liabilities that arise from clinical trials of our product candidates 
we may not have sufficient resources to pay for any liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from  or beyond the limit of  such insurance coverage 
any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of the hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials we use in our business could be time consuming and costly 
our research and development processes have in the past and may in the future involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials and our operations have in the past produced and may in the future produce hazardous waste products 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from those materials 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials 
we may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research  development and production activities 

table of contents our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance  public disclosure and accounting requirements that could adversely affect our business and financial results 
we are subject to changing rules and regulations of federal and state government as well as the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  and the nasdaq global market  have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by congress 
on july   the dodd frank wall street reform and protection act  or the dodd frank act  was enacted 
the dodd frank act contains significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions  some of which the sec has recently implemented by adopting additional rules and regulations in areas such as executive compensation 
if we fail to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of  the dodd frank act and associated sec rules  or any other regulations  we could be subject to a range of consequences  including the de listing of our common stock from the nasdaq global market  significant fines  or other sanctions or litigation 
our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  an increase in expenses and a diversion of management s time from other business activities 
our revenues  expenses and operating results are subject to fluctuations that may cause our stock price to decline 
our revenues  expenses and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly or decline 
some of the factors that could cause our revenues  expenses and operating results to fluctuate include the sale of an asset  the termination of research and development contracts with collaborators  if any  which may not be renewed or replaced  the success rate of our development or discovery efforts leading to milestones and royalties under collaboration arrangements  if any  the timing of licensing fees or the achievement of milestones under new or existing licensing and collaborative arrangements  including the potential milestone payment from bayer  the timing of expenses  particularly with respect to any future contract manufacturing  preclinical studies and clinical trials  the timing and willingness of any potential future collaborators or other third parties to commercialize our products  which would result in royalties to us  and general and industry specific economic conditions  which may affect the research and development expenditures of any future collaborator 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
our operating results in some quarters may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
in that case  our stock price would likely decline 
we are subject to us federal and state income tax examination for calendar tax years ended through and are subject to various international tax examinations for the calendar tax years ended through in addition  danish tax authorities are currently auditing our danish tax filings for the years through while we do not believe there will be any material tax liability associated with this audit  we cannot guarantee the outcome of this audit and  as a result  this ongoing audit  or any future tax audits  may result in material tax liabilities  such as adjustments  penalties  interest and other amounts  that could adversely affect our financial position and cause our stock price to decline 

table of contents if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  we may not be able to preserve our cash balances or access such sources if necessary 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
while we maintain an investment portfolio typically consisting of money market funds  us treasury securities and short term commercial paper and have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities  we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen 
under extreme market conditions  there can be no assurance that we would be able to preserve our cash balances or that such sources would be available or sufficient for our business 
our facilities in california are located near an earthquake fault  and an earthquake or other types of natural disasters or resource shortages could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results 
our facilities and substantially all of our important documents and records  such as hard copies of our laboratory books and records for our maxy g product candidate and our electronic business records  are located in our corporate headquarters at a single location in the san francisco bay area  near active earthquake zones 
we do not have a formal business continuity or disaster recovery plan  and in the event of a natural disaster  such as an earthquake or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems  we could experience a significant business interruption 
our stock price has been  and may continue to be  volatile  and an investment in our stock could decline in value 
the trading prices of life science company stocks in general  and ours in particular  have experienced significant price fluctuations in the last several years 
the valuations of many life science companies without product revenues and earnings  including ours  are based on valuation standards such as progress in product development or clinical trials 
trading prices based on these valuations may not be sustained 
any negative change in the public s perception of the prospects of biotechnology or life science companies could depress our stock price regardless of our results of operations 
other broad market and industry factors may decrease the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our performance 
in addition  our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following our consummation  or our failure to consummate  any strategic transaction  our implementation  or our failure to implement  any additional distributions of our cash resources to stockholders  our receipt of  or failure to receive  any licensing or milestone fees or the achievement of milestones under new or existing licensing and collaborative arrangements  including the potential payment from bayer  our failure to meet any publicly announced product development timetables  adverse or inconclusive results or delays in preclinical development or clinical trials  any entry into or amendment or termination of a material agreement  any decisions to discontinue or delay any future preclinical or clinical development  announcements of new technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  conditions or trends in the biotechnology and life science industries  changes in the market valuations of other biotechnology or life science companies  developments in domestic and international governmental policy or regulations  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  
table of contents changes in general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  interest rate changes  terrorist acts and other factors  developments in or challenges relating to our patent or other proprietary rights  including lawsuits or proceedings alleging patent infringement based on the development  manufacturing or commercialization of maxy g or any potential future product candidates  and sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market 
in the past  stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation after periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
if a stockholder files a securities class action suit against us  we could incur substantial legal fees and our management s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business to respond to the litigation 
substantial sales of shares may adversely impact the market price of our common stock 
our common stock trading volume is low and thus the market price of our common stock is particularly sensitive to trading volume 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or other equity awards  the market price of our common stock may decline 
significant sales of our common stock may adversely impact the then prevailing market price of our common stock 
volatility in the stock prices of other companies may contribute to volatility in our stock price 
the stock market in general  and the nasdaq global market and the market for technology companies in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
further  there has been particular volatility in the market prices of securities of early stage and development stage life sciences companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources  and could harm our reputation and business

see forward looking statements and risk factors 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the potential further development of our maxy g product candidate  a next generation pegylated  granulocyte colony stimulating factor  or g csf  for the treatment of chemotherapy induced neutropenia and acute radiation syndrome  or ars 
in may  a subsidiary of astellas pharma inc  or astellas  acquired all of our interests in perseid therapeutics llc  or perseid  for million in cash 
perseid  a former majority owned subsidiary  included substantially all of our research and development operations and personnel 
as a result of the acquisition of perseid by astellas  we have no further interests or obligations with respect to the business and operations of perseid  except for the ongoing technology license agreement between the companies entered into as a part of the joint venture arrangement 
the acquisition of perseid by astellas largely completed a multi year strategic process to restructure our operations  a process that also included the sale or distribution of various other assets  such as our vaccines assets  the patent rights relating to the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform  and substantially all of our equity interests in codexis  inc  or codexis 
we continue to retain all rights to our maxy g program for development of all therapeutic areas  including chemotherapy induced neutropenia and ars indications  and we continue to evaluate the potential further development of the program for both indications 
our current focus is to create value from this program for our stockholders  either through the potential further development of the product candidate for one or both indications  or through a sale  licensing  partnering or other transaction involving the program 
we also continue to evaluate potential strategic options for our company as a whole  including a strategic business combination  other transaction  or a wind down of the company 
we currently have eight employees  all of whom are engaged in general and administrative activities  and we have significantly curtailed our operations and decreased our operating expenses 
however  we expect our operating expenses to increase if we engage in any further development of our maxy g program or pursue any strategic combination or other transactions 
as of december   we held approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we also remain eligible for a payment of up to million from bayer healthcare llc  or bayer  related to the sale of our hematology assets to bayer in july we have previously distributed cash and property to our stockholders and have repurchased our common stock under various stock repurchase programs 
we also have a current stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to purchase up to million of our common stock through december  in addition  given that we continue to have large cash reserves  we expect to consider and evaluate additional distributions to our stockholders of a portion of our cash resources in excess of our current and longer term operational requirements  although none are currently contemplated 
such distributions may be accomplished through cash dividends  distributions or other mechanisms and may be fully or partially taxable depending on the circumstances of such distribution 
we may also use our cash resources to continue repurchases of our common stock 
our plans with respect to any future distributions  stock repurchases or other strategic transactions will be largely dependent on any future developments related to our maxy g program  whether we receive the remaining payment from bayer and the future financial commitments and longer term operational requirements related to our business 

table of contents significant developments significant developments during included in may  astellas acquired all of our interests in perseid for million in cash 
in may  we submitted a proposal to the biomedical advanced research and development authority  or barda  for the development of our maxy g product candidate as a potential medical countermeasure for ars 
in november  we were advised by barda that our proposal would not be considered for a contract award primarily due to barda funding availability 
in may  we announced an open market stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to million of our common stock through december  the program was increased to million in september  and we repurchased  shares under this program during at an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in october  the united states patent and trademark office  or pto  issued a right of appeal notice in the inter partes reexamination proceeding for a patent of amgen inc us pat 
no 
 that includes a final rejection of all claims in the amgen patent 
amgen s patent includes certain claims to mutated g csf molecules that potentially cover our maxy g product candidate 
the decision is being appealed by amgen 
at present  we have no significant source of revenues  other than the revenue that would be recognized upon the potential receipt of the remaining contingent payment from bayer 
we continue to maintain a strong cash position  with cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million as of december  for the purposes of this report  our continuing operations consist of the results of maxygen  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  maxygen holdings us  inc  maxygen aps and maxygen holdings  inc  as well as its majority owned subsidiary  maxygen holdings llc 
discontinued operations consist of the results of perseid and related predecessor operations prior to the formation of the perseid joint venture in critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies  including those that reflect the more significant judgments  estimates and assumptions we make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
source of revenue and revenue recognition policy we have generally recognized revenue from multiple element arrangements under collaborative research agreements  including license payments  research and development services  milestones  and royalties 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met 
we estimate the selling price for each deliverable using the vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  if it exists  otherwise third party evidence of selling price 
if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable  then we use our best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective estimated selling prices  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each of the separate units 
non refundable upfront payments received in connection with collaboration agreements  including license fees and technology advancement funding that is intended for the development of our core technologies  are deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue over the period of delivery of the undelivered element  typically 
table of contents the relevant research and development periods specified in the agreement 
under arrangements where we expect our research and development obligations to be performed evenly over the specified period  the upfront payments are recognized on a straight line basis over such period 
under arrangements where we expect our research and development obligations to vary significantly from period to period  we recognize the upfront payments based upon the actual amount of research and development efforts incurred relative to the amount of the total expected effort to be incurred by us 
in cases where the planned levels of research services fluctuate substantially over the research term  this requires us to make critical estimates in both the remaining time period and the total expected costs of its obligations and  therefore  a change in the estimate of total costs to be incurred or in the remaining time period could have a significant impact on the revenue recognized in future periods 
revenue related to collaborative research payments from a collaborator is recognized as research services are performed over the related funding periods for each contract 
under these agreements  we are typically required to perform research and development activities as specified in the respective agreement 
generally  the payments received are not refundable and are based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
under certain collaborative research and development agreements  we and the collaborative partner may agree to share in the costs of research and development 
in periods where we incur more costs than the collaborative partner  payments from the collaborative partner are included in collaborative research and development revenues and  in periods where the collaborative partner incurs more expenses than us  our payments to the collaborative partner are included in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses including associated general and administrative expenses under the collaborative research agreements approximate or exceed the research funding revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
deferred revenue may result when we do not incur the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective contracts 
incentive milestone payments may be triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product 
consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone can be recognized in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone meets all the criteria for the milestone to be considered substantive at the inception of the arrangement 
for a milestone to be considered substantive  the consideration earned by achieving the milestone should i be commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  ii relate solely to past performance and iii be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
for events for which the occurrences are contingent solely upon the passage of time or are the result of performance by a third party  the contingent payments will be recognized as revenue when payments are earned  the amounts are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third party sales can be reliably measured and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of pre clinical program assets or license agreements for which no further performance obligations exist are recognized as revenue on the earlier of when payments are received or the amount can be reliably measured and collectability is reasonably assured 
stock based compensation expense the accounting treatment for stock options  restricted stock units  restricted stock awards and shares previously purchased under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  requires us to recognize the fair value of the equity based awards 
in addition  we are required to recognize the fair value of our liability based awards  which as of december   consisted solely of contingent performance units  or cpus 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and espp shares using the black scholes merton valuation model and  for cpus  we use 
table of contents a monte carlo simulation model 
these models require the input of subjective assumptions  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock  and for our cpus  the market price of codexis  inc common stock  and the expected term of each award 
we estimate expected volatility based on historical volatilities 
the risk free interest rate is based on the rates paid on securities issued by the us treasury with a term approximating the expected life of the option or cpu 
the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share  divided by the stock price at the date of grant 
for restricted stock units and restricted stock awards  we estimate fair value based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
for stock option awards to employees in  the expected life of the stock options was calculated using the shortcut method permitted under applicable sec accounting guidance 
when establishing the expected life assumption in prior periods  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
due to the change in our structure and operations and the small number of individuals receiving option awards since  we no longer consider our historical experience or that of our peers to be representative of future expected life 
therefore in  we changed to the shortcut method for establishing the expected life assumption 
for non employee awards  the expected life of the stock options was based on the life of the stock option 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes merton calculations for new grants is based on historical volatilities 
the risk free interest rate is based on the rates paid on securities issued by the us treasury with a term approximating the expected life of the option 
the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share  divided by the stock price at the date of grant 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
stock based compensation expense recognized within continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and was as follows in thousands year ended december  employee stock options restricted stock units restricted stock awards consultant options espp contingent performance units total stock based compensation expense in  we recorded additional stock compensation expense of million as part of the restructuring charge which resulted from the accelerated vesting and the extension of the exercise period of certain stock options pursuant to our agreements with certain former executives 
restricted stock awards we have granted restricted stock awards under our equity incentive plan  or plan  to certain employees and members of our board of directors 
restricted stock awards are scheduled to vest over four years 
the plan and related award agreement provide for forfeiture in certain events  such as voluntary termination of employment  and for acceleration of vesting in certain events  such as termination of employment without cause or a change in control of us 
compensation cost for these awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and is recognized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
given the relative lack of sufficient history of granting restricted stock awards 
table of contents coupled with the fact that restricted stock awards outstanding are concentrated among a few individuals  we have not applied a forfeiture discount to our stock compensation expense for restricted stock awards 
during the twelve months ended december  and  we granted restricted stock awards to employees and the members of our board of directors representing an aggregate of  and  shares of common stock  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  stock based compensation expense related to the grant of restricted stock awards was allocated as follows in thousands year ended december  research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense contingent performance units in september  we granted cpus under the plan to all employees and board members who held options to purchase our common stock  and since that date we have also granted cpus in connection with the grant of new stock option awards 
cpus vest on the earliest to occur of i a change in control of maxygen  ii a corporate dissolution or liquidation of maxygen  iii an involuntary termination of employment without cause  or iv the fourth anniversary of the grant date the settlement date  generally so long as the holder continues to provide services for us on a continuous basis from the grant date to the settlement date 
the cpus are designed to protect holders of our stock options against a reduction in the share price of our common stock resulting from dividends or distributions to our stockholders  which could negatively affect outstanding options held by our option holders since the options would not otherwise participate in any dividends or distributions to our stockholders 
the earned value of any vested cpu will generally be settled in shares of our common stock  but may also be settled  in part  with cash or any property distributed by us  or entirely in cash 
all unvested cpus remaining following the settlement date will expire immediately 
as a result of the distribution of  shares of codexis  inc common stock and special cash distribution in the amount of per share in december  the value of the cpu awards became reasonably estimable for financial reporting purposes 
these awards were remeasured as of december   as required for liability awards 
as a result of the acquisition by astellas of our equity interests in perseid  all vested cpu awards held by employees of perseid were settled in full on may  the value of the settled cpus was based on i the fair value of our common stock  ii the fair value of the codexis  inc common stock  and iii the per share cash distribution made in december during  approximately  in cash was paid to settle vested cpus  with  of such amount paid to settle vested cpus held by employees of perseid 
the fair value of the remaining cpus was approximately million at december   as determined based on a monte carlo simulation using the following assumptions expected dividend yield risk free interest rate range expected life years years expected volatility of maxygen  inc common stock expected volatility of codexis  inc common stock 
table of contents the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield in effect at each reporting date  with a term commensurate with the estimated remaining expected life of the award 
expected life is based on the remaining time to settlement for each award 
expected volatility of both our common stock and the codexis  inc common stock is based on the historical volatility  as available  of such stock commensurate with the expected life of each award 
we recognized approximately  and  of compensation expense in the years ended december  and  respectively  related to changes in the fair value of the cpu liability within continuing operations 
no compensation expense was recorded prior to as the payout of the cpu awards was not deemed probable and estimable at such date 
as the cpus are accounted for as liability awards  we will re measure their fair value at each reporting date and will record compensation expense utilizing a straight line attribution method 
as the earned distribution value of any vested cpu can be settled in shares of our common stock  cash or the property distributed to stockholders  and because such property has an inherent ability to appreciate or depreciate in price by the settlement date  we have reserved  from our december distribution of codexis  inc common stock  a number of shares of codexis  inc common stock that we deemed sufficient to settle our maximum potential liability related to the earned distribution value for each cpu 
at december   we reserved  shares of codexis  inc common stock for this purpose 
for the years ended december   and  stock based compensation expense related to the grant of cpus was allocated as follows in thousands year ended december  research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense restricted stock units during  we granted restricted stock unit awards under the plan representing an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the restricted stock units granted represented a right to receive shares of common stock at a future date determined in accordance with the participant s award agreement 
an exercise price and monetary payment were not required for receipt of restricted stock units or the shares issued in settlement of the award 
instead  consideration was furnished in the form of the participant s services to us 
substantially all of the restricted stock units were originally scheduled to vest over two years 
however  in connection with the formation of perseid  certain of these restricted stock units became fully vested on november  this did not affect the restricted stock units held by our former executive officers  who had different equity acceleration provisions in their employment related agreements 
compensation cost for these awards was based on the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in stock based compensation expense within continuing operations related to these restricted stock unit awards 
in  we recognized a credit to stock based compensation expense of  within continuing operations resulting from the actual forfeiture rate of restricted stock units scheduled to vest in being greater than the estimated forfeiture rate of terminated employees 
at december   there were no restricted stock unit awards that remained outstanding and no further grants of restricted stock units during thus  there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to these awards at december  and 
table of contents for the years ended december   and  stock based compensation expense within continuing operations related to the grant of restricted stock units was allocated as follows in thousands year ended december  research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense profits interest units perseid granted profits interest units pius under its perseid equity incentive plan to employees of perseid and to employees of maxygen who were providing services to perseid 
a piu is a special type of limited liability company common unit that allowed the recipient to participate in the increase in the value of perseid 
the pius were intended to meet the definition of a profits interest under irs revenue procedure and irs revenue procedure the pius were originally scheduled to vest over four years  subject to the recipient remaining an employee or service provider of perseid through each vesting date and subject to accelerated vesting under certain circumstances 
in connection with the consummation of the purchase by astellas of our equity interests in perseid on may   astellas purchased for cash all vested pius held by perseid s then current and former employees and other service providers as of the closing date and paid cash for all remaining unvested pius on november  six months after closing 
the cash value of a piu was equal to the deemed value of a perseid common unit at the time of the buy out of our equity interests in perseid by astellas based on the option exercise price  less the deemed value of a common unit at the time the piu was granted 
we have recorded compensation expense associated with the pius of million within discontinued operations in the year ended december  and there was no compensation expense related to pius recorded in the year ended december  since we deconsolidated perseid s financial results from our consolidated financial statements on may   the date of the acquisition of perseid by astellas  no further compensation expense will be recorded in connection with these awards 
the value of the pius was determined based on the option exercise price of million on march   the date astellas exercised its option 
results of operations the discussion of our results of operations that follows is based on amounts reported in our financial statements which are classified as continuing operations  unless otherwise noted 
as a result of the acquisition of perseid by astellas  we have reclassified perseid s operating activities  including those of its predecessor operations prior to the formation of the perseid joint venture in  as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
revenues our revenues have been derived primarily from collaboration agreements  technology and license arrangements and government research grants 
total revenues were  in  million in and million in technology and license revenue was  in  million in and  in the technology and license revenue in consisted primarily of the final payment we received in july from altravax  inc  or altravax  in connection with its acquisition of substantially all of our vaccine assets in january the technology and license revenue in consisted of million related to the sale to altravax and a

related party revenue was million in and million in no related party revenue was recorded in related party revenue in and consisted of revenues received by us under our prior licensing arrangement with codexis  which was terminated in october in connection with the acquisition by codexis of the intellectual property rights associated with the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform 
as a result of our sale of the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform to codexis and the related termination of our license agreement with codexis  we are no longer eligible for any further payments or potential royalties from codexis under the prior license agreement 
grant revenue was million in no grant revenue was recorded in or the absence of grant revenue in and reflects the elimination of government research grants from the national institutes of health  or nih  and the us department of defense  or dod  that were transferred to altravax as part of their acquisition of our vaccine assets in january grant revenue in was generated from a number of grants from both the nih and dod 
external costs were passed through to each grant and recognized as revenue on a cost reimbursement basis 
we expect that future revenues  if any  would be generated by the potential receipt of the remaining contingent payment from bayer or revenue that would be generated based on the completion of any strategic transactions or new licensing agreements relating to maxy g however  we cannot predict whether we will enter into any strategic transaction or new licensing agreements or receive any payments under any existing or future licensing or other agreements 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses have consisted primarily of external collaborative research expenses including contract manufacturing  contract research and clinical trial expenses  salaries and benefits  facility costs  supplies  research consultants  depreciation and stock compensation expense 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease in our research and development expenses in was primarily due to lower patent research costs  partially offset by an increase in stock compensation expense 
the decrease in our research and development expenses in was as a result of the cessation of activities supporting our government grants  which were transferred to altravax in january  and decreased development costs associated with our maxy g program 
we expect our research and development expenses to be maintained well below historical levels and could decrease further compared to however  the potential further development of our maxy g product candidate could result in a significant increase in our research and development expenses 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  legal  general management  business development and human resources  stock compensation expense  business consultants and professional expenses  such as external expenditures for legal  accounting services and board fees

table of contents and benefits  and a lower allocation of administrative costs charged to perseid under a transition service agreement 
the activities of the consultants who assisted us in the preparation of the proposal we submitted to barda were primarily advisory in nature and no product development efforts were undertaken by such consultants 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in stock compensation expense and external legal costs 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to decreases for legal and accounting services  external consultants and financial advisors in connection with the consummation of various strategic transactions in and decreases in salaries  benefits and stock compensation resulting from a reduction in headcount completed in april and the termination of two executive officers as of september  our general and administrative expenses during are expected to be comparable to  depending on  among other things  the use of external consultants and expenditures for legal and accounting services 
however  we expect such expenses to increase significantly if we pursue any strategic transactions 
restructuring charges we recorded a credit to restructuring charges of  in compared with restructuring charges of million in no restructuring charge was recorded in the credit recorded in relates to a reversal of our restructuring accrual for which we have no further payment obligations 
in  approximately million of these restructuring charges related to the modification of existing option grants pursuant to our agreements with our former executives

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and the price fluctuations of certain equity securities 
to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risk  we from time to time enter into currency forward contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate and market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while  at the same time  maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including corporate obligations and money market funds  although more recently we have restricted our investments to money market funds containing primarily us treasury securities and the direct investment of us treasury securities 
at december   million of our cash and cash equivalent balance was held in us currency with the remaining  held in danish kroners 
as of december   all of our investments in us treasury securities were scheduled to mature in six months or less 
the average investment yield for our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  was 
we did not hold derivative instruments intended to mitigate interest rate risk as of december   and we have never held such instruments in the past 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the fair value of our portfolio would not materially change as the majority of our investment portfolio at december  consisted of securities with overnight maturities 
foreign currency exchange risk to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we from time to time enter into cash flow hedging arrangements 
currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging arrangements 
our hedging arrangements are intended to reduce  but may not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
gains and losses on these foreign currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure to us on the amounts hedged 
at december   we had a forward exchange contract outstanding in the amount of  the fair value of this contract of  is recorded as a component of other accrued liabilities at december  we did not have any forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  equity price risk our exposure to changes in equity security prices relates to our ownership of codexis  inc common stock 
at december   we owned  shares of codexis  inc common stock and recorded the fair value for these shares of million  as determined by the closing price of such stock on december  a hypothetical change in the price of codexis  inc common stock would cause the fair value of million reported at december  to change by  market prices for equity securities in general are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale or disposition of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
we do not hedge our exposure to equity security price risk
