net revenues  before interest on mandatorily redeemable preferred interests  for the eleven months ended november  were a record  million  an increase of over previous record net revenues of  million 
the increase was primarily due to an increase of in investment banking revenue to a record million for fiscal  and a increase in equities sales and trading revenue from the year 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in fixed income revenue and a decline in asset management revenue as compared with the prior year 
net revenues for the twelve months ended december  also included a gain on extinguishment of debt of million as we repurchased approximately million of our outstanding long term debt during interest on mandatorily redeemable preferred interests of consolidated subsidiaries represents the allocation of earnings and losses from our consolidated high yield business to third party noncontrolling interest holders invested in that business through mandatorily redeemable preferred securities

v 
total equities revenue was million and million for the twelve months ended november  and eleven months ended november   respectively  an increase of million or 
our equities revenue is primarily driven by client transaction volumes 
equity market conditions during the first half of were mainly characterized by lower stock market volumes and a reduction in equity market volatility as compared with uneven equity prices and higher stock market volumes for the six months ended may  while volumes picked up significantly in august with increased volatility  investors concern over the us economy  the standard poor s downgrade of the us long term credit rating and the continued sovereign debt crisis within the european region caused investors to be reluctant to take risk and transact in the remaining months of further  client transaction flows were reduced notably in november due to the attention focused on our firm following the bankruptcy of mf global holdings  ltd 
subsequent to november  our transaction flows have returned to more normal levels consistent with those preceding the november events 
declines in client stock volumes negatively impacted our us cash equities trading revenues  while net revenues from us derivatives grew slightly 
international equities revenue benefited from the development of our asia cash equities business  expansion of our europe sales force and improved international electronic product capabilities 
prime brokerage and securities finance revenues benefited from new clients and higher balances  as well as transaction volumes with existing clients 
a gain was also recognized related to our ownership of lme shares consistent with recent sales of shares of the exchange 
these increases in equities revenue were partially offset by reduced net revenues from our equity joint ventures as increased interest expense was incurred in supporting these ventures 
in november  the company entered into an agreement to sell certain correspondent broker accounts and assign the related clearing arrangements 
the purchase price was dependent on the number and amount of client accounts that convert to the purchaser s platform

equities revenue for the eleven months ended november  does not include any significant gain from transaction and revenue from our correspondent clearing business 
v 
total equities revenue was million and million  respectively  in fiscal and in  a increase from this increase was primarily due to positive block trading opportunities  higher alternative investment revenue and enhanced results from certain strategic investment strategies 
growth in our international equities platform  an increased client base and balances in our prime brokerage business and stronger revenue generated by our equity derivative business with greater market volatility also contributed to an increase in equities revenue for over the prior period 
increases in equities revenue from these businesses was partially offset by a decline in revenue generated by our cash equities business  which was affected by reduced client volumes for the eleven month period consistent with lower overall trading volumes experienced by the major exchanges 
fixed income revenue fixed income revenue primarily includes commissions  principal transactions and net interest revenue from investment grade corporate bonds  mortgage and asset backed securities  government and agency securities  municipal bonds  emerging markets debt  high yield and distressed securities  bank loans and commodities trading activities 
fixed income revenue also includes the results of operations from jefferies bache sales and trading activities in commodities  foreign exchange  futures and other derivative products 
v 
the first half of the fiscal year was characterized by reasonable customer flow  tighter bid offer spreads  ample liquidity and rising commodity prices 
beginning in the third quarter of  concerns about european sovereign debt risk  the deteriorating global economy  the uncertainty created by the us deficit negotiations and continuing high unemployment in the us led to challenging trading conditions 
market volatility in certain fixed income sectors suppressed customer activity 
trading conditions were particularly difficult in august while the fixed income markets improved slightly in the fourth quarter of  our customer volumes were negatively impacted during november due to external stresses concentrated on our business following the bankruptcy of mf global holdings ltd 
customer volumes have since returned to more normal levels previously experienced before the disruptive events in november fixed income revenue was million for the twelve months ended november   a decrease of  compared to million for the eleven months ended november  the decrease in fixed income revenue for fiscal as compared to is primarily attributed to declines in corporate  mortgage backed security  high yield and emerging market revenues 
the drop in prices in the second half of led to significant mark downs in high yield and corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities 
in addition  a flight to quality beginning in the third quarter of led to us treasury yields trading at the lowest levels on record  resulting in losses on short treasury positions used as inventory hedges in our corporates and mortgage backed securities businesses 
the results for also include losses on certain us dollar denominated interest rate swap futures contracts which fully closed out in august cleared through international derivatives clearing group 
the decrease in fixed income revenue from these businesses was partially offset by revenue increases from our government and agency sales and trading revenues in the us  europe and asia 
fixed income revenue reflects the continued growth of our fixed income platform in europe with strong performance from our euro rates platform  as well as improved performance from our us government and agency business due to increased customer flow from ample liquidity and  to a lesser extent  inventory appreciation as spreads tightened in the earlier part of the period 
stronger performance from our municipal trading activities benefited overall fixed income revenue as a result of recent strengthening of our trading effort and new products offered  partially offset 
table of contents jefferies group  inc 
and subsidiaries continued by trading losses and widening credit spreads that impacted the municipal trading business in the latter part of fixed income revenue for fiscal also includes revenue contributions from jefferies bache for a five month period as a result of the acquisition from prudential on july  during november  we significantly reduced our inventory holdings in sovereign debt of portugal  italy  ireland  greece and spain with no meaningful profit or loss impact on our trading revenues 
while we sold such positions  these actions had no substantive effect on our ability to fulfill our role and obligations as a primary dealer and market maker in the debt securities of these countries and no effect on our execution relationships with our clients 
our positions are held as inventory in the context of our market making activities and turn over frequently 
our inventory holdings of european sovereign debt are comprised of both financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased both long and short debt securities as we are an active two way market maker 
we have continued to expand our market share and grow our euro rates platform over the past several years and do not believe the reduction in our inventory in november or our ongoing exposure to european sovereign debt will negatively influence our growth or the success of our euro rates platform 
v 
fixed income market conditions during the eleven months ended november  were characterized by tightening bid offer spreads and treasury yields as well as concerns over world economic conditions  particularly in europe 
this is compared with fixed income market conditions for the twelve months ended december   which were more favorable for fixed income trading  including widening spreads  and reflected a more favorable competitive landscape 
this impact on the broad fixed income markets was partially offset by an improved market for high new issues of fixed income securities  particularly in the latter part of fiscal fixed income revenue for the eleven month period ended november  as compared to the twelve months ended december  reflects the impact of the change in market conditions 
fixed income revenue was million for the eleven months ended november   down from revenue of  million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in revenue for fiscal reflects the challenging market conditions given economic disruption in certain world markets and the continued tightening of corporate bond and treasury spreads 
these factors had a dampening effect on customer flow across several of our fixed income businesses although improvement in overall volumes began in the fourth quarter of from the more recent quarterly periods 
the decline in revenue for the period as compared to the period is largely attributed to declines in revenue from our corporate bond  us government and agencies  mortgage backed securities  emerging markets debt and bank loan trading activities as well as reduced revenue from certain principal transaction trading opportunities 
the decline in revenue contributions was partially offset by revenue contributions for the eleven months ended november  from our european government bond trading business  which commenced operations in the latter part of and significantly expanded its platform in europe in the early part of  and improved revenue results from our high yield and commodities sales and trading activities as compared to the period 
revenues from our investment grade corporate bond  convertible securities and emerging markets debt trading activities for the eleven months ended november  were negatively affected by tightening credit spreads and the difficult conditions in world credit markets during the period and downward pressure on yields  although this was partially offset by positive trading opportunities in latin american debt in the latter part of this is compared to a period of historically wide credit spreads during the twelve months ended december  and market volatility in the credit markets resulting in a considerably strong performance from our corporate bond trading business in the period 
emerging markets revenue was also particularly strong in as both volumes and market share were higher and we benefited from trading opportunities from new issuances and sovereign debt restructurings 

table of contents jefferies group  inc 
and subsidiaries continued continued tightening in treasury yields and a consensus dampening on inflation during the eleven months ended november  contributed to the decline in trading revenue from our us government and agencies business as compared to a favorable trading environment in the period 
mortgage backed securities revenue decreased during the period on tightening bid offer spreads and a challenging international environment with an intensified sovereign debt crisis as compared to high levels of customer trading volume and certain exceptional trading opportunities in the comparable prior period 
the expansion of our government and agencies platform in europe  assisted by our appointment in several european jurisdictions as dealers for government bond issues resulted in additional fixed income generation for fiscal with increased customer flow volumes 
high yield sales and trading revenue increased for the eleven months ended november  as compared to the twelve months ended december  benefiting from strong market conditions for high yield issuances and market volatility  although international high yield revenue was affected by the credit concerns within europe and losses on certain credit hedges impacted the revenue contributions from our bank loan trading activities

recent accounting developments balance sheet offsetting disclosures 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu to topic  balance sheet 
the update requires new disclosures about balance sheet offsetting and related arrangements 
for derivatives and financial assets and liabilities  the amendments require disclosure of gross asset and liability amounts  amounts offset on the balance sheet  and amounts subject to the offsetting requirements but not offset on the balance sheet 
the guidance is effective december  and is to be applied retrospectively 
this guidance does not amend the existing guidance on when it is appropriate to offset  as a result  we do not expect this guidance to affect our financial condition  results of operation or cash flows 
goodwill testing in september  the fasb issued an asu  testing goodwill for impairment asu to topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
the update outlines amendments to the two step goodwill impairment test permitting an entity to first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the update is effective for annual and interim goodwill tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this guidance will not affect our financial condition  results of operation or cash flows 
fair value measurements and disclosures 
in may  the fasb issued accounting updates to asc  fair value measurements topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  which provide clarifying guidance on how to measure fair value and additional disclosure requirements 
the amendments prohibit the use of blockage factors at all levels of the fair value hierarchy and provide guidance on measuring financial instruments that are managed on a net portfolio basis 
additional disclosure requirements include transfers between levels and  and for level fair value measurements  a description of our valuation processes and additional information about unobservable inputs impacting level measurements 
the updates are effective march  and will be applied prospectively 
the adoption of this guidance will not affect our financial condition  results of operation or cash flows 
reconsideration of effective control for repurchase agreements 
in april  the fasb issued accounting guidance that removes the requirement to consider whether sufficient collateral is held when 
table of contents jefferies group  inc 
and subsidiaries continued determining whether to account for repurchase agreements and other agreements that both entitle and obligate the transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity as sales or as secured financings 
the guidance is effective prospectively for transactions beginning on january  the adoption of this guidance will not have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
consolidation we adopted accounting changes described in asc  consolidation topic  as of january   which require that the party who has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and who has an obligation to absorb losses of the entity or a right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity consolidate the variable interest entity 
the changes to asc  effective as of january   eliminate the quantitative approach previously applied to assessing whether to consolidate a variable interest entity and require ongoing reassessments for consolidation 
upon adoption of these accounting changes on january   we consolidated certain clos and other investment vehicles 
the consolidation of these entities resulted in an increase in total assets of  million  an increase in total liabilities of  million and an increase to total stockholders equity of million on january  subsequently  we sold and assigned our management agreements for the clos to a third party  thus we no longer have the power to direct the most significant activities of the clos 
upon the assignment of the management agreements in january  we deconsolidated the clos and accounted for our remaining interests in the clos at fair value 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
actual results can and may differ from estimates 
these differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of us gaap and the associated estimates are reasonable 
our accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
we believe our critical accounting policies policies that are both material to the financial condition and results of operations and require our most subjective or complex judgments are our valuation of financial instruments  assessment of goodwill and our use of estimates related to compensation and benefits during the year 
valuation of financial instruments financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased are recorded at fair value 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit price 
unrealized gains or losses are generally recognized in principal transactions in our consolidated statements of earnings 

table of contents jefferies group  inc 
and subsidiaries continued the following is a summary of the fair value of major categories of financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased  as of november  and november  in thousands november  november  financial instruments owned financial instruments sold  not yet purchased financial instruments owned financial instruments sold  not yet purchased corporate equity securities corporate debt securities government  federal agency and other sovereign obligations mortgage and asset backed securities loans and other receivables derivatives investments physical commodities at november  derivative liabilities included within financial instruments sold  not yet purchased were comprised primarily of exchange traded equity options  over the counter otc foreign currency forwards and options  otc commodity forwards and options  and interest rate and commodity swaps 
at november  derivative liabilities within financial instruments sold  not yet purchased were comprised primarily of exchange traded equity options and interest rate swaps 
fair value hierarchy in determining fair value  we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources 
unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
we apply a hierarchy to categorize our fair value measurements broken down into three levels based on the transparency of inputs  where level uses observable prices in active markets and level uses valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and broker quotes that are considered less observable 
greater use of management judgment is required in determining fair value when inputs are less observable or unobservable in the marketplace  such as when the volume or level of trading activity for a financial instrument has decreased and when certain factors suggest that observed transactions may not be reflective of orderly market transactions 
judgment must be applied in determining the appropriateness of available prices  particularly in assessing whether available data reflects current prices and or reflects the results of recent market transactions 
prices or quotes are weighed when estimating fair value with greater reliability placed on information from transactions that are considered to be representative of orderly market transactions 
fair value is a market based measure  therefore  when market observable inputs are not available  our judgment is applied to reflect those judgments that a market participant would use in valuing the same asset or liability 
the availability of observable inputs can vary for different products 
we use prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date even in periods of market disruption or illiquidity 
the valuation of financial instruments classified in level of the fair value hierarchy involves the greatest amount of management

while our financial instruments sold  not yet purchased  which are included within liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial condition  are accounted for at fair value  we do not account for any of our other liabilities at fair value  except for certain secured financings that arise in connection with our securitization activities included with other liabilities of approximately million and million at november  and  respectively

controls over the valuation process for financial instruments our valuation team  independent of the trading function  plays an important role in determining that our financial instruments are appropriately valued and that fair value measurements are reliable 
this is particularly important where prices or valuations that require inputs are less observable 
in the event that observable inputs are not available  the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable 
where a pricing model is used to determine fair value  these control processes include reviews of the pricing model s theoretical soundness and appropriateness by risk management personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks 
in addition  recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model 
goodwill at least annually  and more frequently if warranted  we assess whether goodwill has been impaired by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair value of reporting units are based on valuations techniques that we believe market participants would use  although the valuation process requires significant judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value could have a significant effect on whether or not an impairment charge is recorded and the magnitude of such a charge 
adverse market or economic events could result in impairment charges in future periods 
refer to note  goodwill and other intangible assets  in our consolidated financial statements for further detail on our assessment of goodwill 
compensation and benefits a portion of our compensation and benefits represents discretionary bonuses  which are finalized at year end 
in addition to the level of net revenues  our overall compensation expense in any given year is influenced by prevailing labor markets  revenue mix  profitability  individual and business performance metrics  and our use of share based compensation programs 
we believe the most appropriate way to allocate estimated annual total compensation among interim periods is in proportion to projected net revenues earned 
consequently  during the year we accrue compensation and benefits based on annual targeted compensation ratios  taking into account the mix of our revenues and the timing of expense recognition 
our compensation and benefits expense for the twelve months ended november   reflects the actual total compensation and benefits we expect to pay for the compensation year

these policies are determined by the nature and needs of our day to day business operations  business opportunities  regulatory obligations  and liquidity requirements 
our actual levels of capital  total assets  and financial leverage are a function of a number of factors  including  asset composition  business initiatives and opportunities  regulatory requirements and cost and availability of both long term and short term funding 
we have historically maintained a balance sheet consisting of a large portion of our total assets in cash and liquid marketable securities  arising principally from traditional securities brokerage activity 
the liquid nature of these assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our business 
analysis of financial condition a business unit level balance sheet and cash capital analysis is prepared and reviewed with senior management on a weekly basis 
as a part of this balance sheet review process  capital is allocated to all assets and gross and adjusted balance sheet limits are established 
this process ensures that the allocation of capital and costs of capital are incorporated into business decisions 
the goals of this process are to protect the firm s platform  enable our businesses to remain competitive  maintain the ability to manage capital proactively and hold businesses accountable for both balance sheet and capital usage 
we actively monitor and evaluate our financial condition and the composition of our assets and liabilities 
substantially all of our financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased are valued on a daily basis and we monitor and employ balance sheet limits for our various businesses 
in connection with our government and agency fixed income business and our role as a primary dealer in these markets  a great portion of our securities inventory is comprised of us government and agency securities and other g government securities

table of contents jefferies group  inc 
and subsidiaries continued the decrease in total assets at november  from november  is primarily due to management s decision to reduce trading balances and leverage to demonstrate the underlying liquidity of our trading assets and liabilities 
this reduction in trading balances was done across asset classes and fair value hierarchy levels 
during the twelve months ended november   average total assets were approximately higher than at november  the decrease in trading related assets as of the year end was partially offset by asset balances arising as a result of our acquisition of the global commodities group from prudential on july  and the reinvestment of trading reductions into cash and cash equivalents 
as a result of jefferies bache  specifically  the outstanding balance of cash and securities segregated and of certain financial instruments owned liquid derivative contracts and physical commodities increased at november  from november  as a futures commission merchant  jefferies bache  llc our us futures commission merchant and jefferies bache limited our uk commodities and financial futures broker dealer  receive cash or securities as margin to secure customer futures trades 
as a result of the acquisition of this business and the related margin requirements for such activity  the balance of cash and securities segregated has increased at november  from the prior period end 
jefferies company  inc a us broker dealer  under sec rule c  and jefferies bache  llc  under cftc regulation  are required to maintain customer cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of our clients 
we are required to conduct customer segregation calculations to ensure the appropriate amounts of funds are segregated and that no customer funds are used to finance firm activity 
similar requirements exist with respect to our uk based activities conducted through jefferies bache limited and jefferies international limited a uk broker dealer 
customer funds received are separately segregated and locked up apart from our funds 
if we rehypothecate customer securities  that activity is conducted only to finance customer activity 
additionally  we do not lend customer cash to counterparties to conduct securities financing activity ie  we do not lend customer cash to reverse in securities 
further  we have no customer loan activity in jefferies international limited and we do not have any european prime brokerage operations 
in jefferies bache limited  any funds received from a customer are placed on deposit and not used as part of our operations 
we do not transfer us customer assets to our us entities 
a significant portion of the increase in our total financial instruments owned inventory resulted from increased holdings of government and agency securities 
our inventory of government  federal agency and other sovereign obligations increased from billion at november  to billion at november  this net increase in our inventory positions long and short inventory is primarily attributed to the continued growth of our us government and agencies and other sovereign debt trading businesses  both domestically and internationally 
as a primary dealer in the us and our similar role in several european jurisdictions  we carry inventory and make an active market for our clients in securities issued by the various governments 
these inventory positions are substantially comprised of the most liquid securities in the asset class  with a significant portion in holdings of securities of g countries 
while our inventory balance has increased from that of the end of  the balance of our inventory in us government and agency securities and other sovereign obligations at november  reflects a significant decrease in outstanding positions from that of prior quarters and the average balance throughout the year as we sought to reduce our gross financial instruments inventory with significant liquidation of our inventory exposure to portugal  italy  ireland  greece and spain in the latter part of fiscal given the liquid nature of this market making trading book  at one point during november  we sold  in a brief period of time  approximately billion of financial instruments owned and billion in financial instruments sold  but not yet purchased with minimal resulting impact on net earnings

and subsidiaries continued our net inventory positions also increased as of november  from november  due to the acquisition of jefferies bache  which resulted in an increase in derivative contracts and physical commodities from that of the prior year 
our mortgage and asset backed securities inventory decreased by  from  million at november  to  million at november   and our corporate debt securities inventory similarly decreased by from  million at november  to  million at november  we continually monitor our overall securities inventory  including the inventory turnover rate  which confirms the liquidity of our overall assets 
of our total financial instruments owned  approximately are readily and consistently financeable at haircuts of or less 
in addition  as a matter of our policy  a portion of these assets have internal capital assessed  which is in addition to the funding haircuts provided in the securities finance markets 
further  our financial instruments owned consists of high yield bonds  bank loans  investments and non agency mortgage backed securities that are predominantly funded by long term capital 
under our cash capital policy  we model capital allocation levels that are more stringent than the haircuts used in the market for secured funding  and we maintain surplus capital at these maximum levels 
at november  and november   our level financial instruments owned for which we have economic exposure was and  respectively  of our total financial instruments owned 
level mortgage and asset backed securities represent of total mortgage and asset backed securities inventory at november  and at november  and represent and of total level assets at november  and november   respectively 
as we reduced our overall trading inventory at the latter part of  the reduction was fairly consistent across all inventory products resulting in a relatively consistent asset profile from period to period as evidenced by the consistent percentage of level asset as of year end as compared to the year end 
securities financing assets and liabilities include both financing for our financial instruments trading activity and matched book transactions 
matched book transactions accommodate customers  as well as obtain securities for the settlement and financing of inventory positions 
the outstanding balance of our securities borrowed and securities purchased under agreements to resell decreased by from november  to november  due to a reduction in the use of secured financing activity to support our fixed income business and a reduction in matched booked activity for our equities securities financing business given reduced market opportunities for returns on this activity in the low interest rate environment 
similarly the outstanding balance of our securities loaned and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by from november  to november  additionally  during  we utilized more repurchase agreements executed with central clearing corporations rather than bi lateral repurchase agreements  which reduces the credit risk associated with these arrangements and results in decreased net outstanding balances 
the average increase in our securities financing assets and liabilities was and  respectively  higher than quarter end balances for the twelve months ended november  and and  respectively  higher than quarter end balances for the eleven months ended november

the general growth in outstanding repurchase activity from early through is reflective of supporting our overall business growth  particularly the continued expansion of our mortgage backed securities sales and trading platform  our appointment as a us federal reserve primary dealer in june and our appointment in similar capacities in various european jurisdictions in in november  we reduced our overall trading inventory as part of an overall strategy to reduce our leverage and demonstrate the liquidity of our trading positions 
repurchase agreements were simultaneously reduced near year end as the financing needs for the trading book were decreased 
additionally  the fluctuations in the balances of our securities purchased under agreements to resell over the periods presented is influenced in any given period by our clients balances and our clients desires to execute collateralized financing arrangements via the repurchase market or via other financing products 
average balances and period end balances will fluctuate based on market and liquidity conditions and we consider the fluctuations intraperiod to be typical for the repurchase market

adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible stockholders equity 
adjusted assets is a non gaap financial measure and excludes certain assets that are considered of lower risk as they are generally self financed by customer liabilities through our securities lending activities 
we view the resulting measure of adjusted leverage  also a non gaap financial measure  as a more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial services companies 
our leverage ratio and adjusted leverage ratio decreased from november  to november  commensurate with the reduction in our trading inventory near the end of november as we actively sought to demonstrate the liquidity of our market making and trading inventory and due to additional equity capital raised in april liquidity management the key objectives of the liquidity management framework are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of financial distress 
our liquidity management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that we may be unable to access adequate financing to service our financial obligations without material franchise or business impact 
the principal elements of our liquidity management framework are our contingency funding plan  our cash capital policy and our assessment of maximum liquidity outflow 
contingency funding plan 
our contingency funding plan is based on a model of a potential liquidity contraction over a one year time period 
this incorporates potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event  
table of contents jefferies group  inc 
and subsidiaries continued including  but not limited to  the following a repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year and no incremental unsecured debt issuance  b maturity rolloff of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance and replacement with cash collateral  c higher margin requirements than currently exist on assets on securities financing activity  including repurchase agreements  d liquidity outflows related to possible credit downgrade  e lower availability of secured funding  f client cash withdrawals  g the anticipated funding of outstanding investment commitments  and h certain accrued expenses and other liabilities and fixed costs 
cash capital policy 
we maintain a cash capital model that measures long term funding sources against requirements 
sources of cash capital include our equity  preferred stock and the noncurrent portion of long term borrowings 
uses of cash capital include the following a illiquid assets such as equipment  goodwill  net intangible assets  exchange memberships  deferred tax assets and certain investments  b a portion of securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment ie  margin requirements and c drawdowns of unfunded commitments 
to ensure that we do not need to liquidate inventory in the event of a funding crisis  we seek to maintain surplus cash capital  which is reflected in the leverage ratios we maintain 
our total capital of billion as of november  exceeded our cash capital requirements 
maximum liquidity outflow 
our businesses are diverse  and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors  including market movements  collateral requirements and client commitments  all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment 
during a liquidity crisis  credit sensitive funding  including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements  may be unavailable  and the terms eg  interest rates  collateral provisions and tenor or availability of other types of secured financing may change 
as a result of our policy to ensure we have sufficient funds to cover what we estimate may be needed in a liquidity crisis  we hold more unencumbered securities and have greater long term debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require 
as part of this estimation process  we calculate a maximum liquidity outflow that could be experienced in a liquidity crisis 
maximum liquidity outflow is based on a scenario that includes both a market wide stress and a firm specific stress  characterized by some or all of the following elements global recession  default by a medium sized sovereign  low consumer and corporate confidence  and general financial instability 
severely challenged market environment with material declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads 
damaging follow on impacts to financial institutions leading to the failure of a large bank 
a firm specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses  reputational damage  litigation  executive departure  and or a ratings downgrade 
the following are the critical modeling parameters of the maximum liquidity outflow liquidity needs over a day scenario 
a two notch downgrade of our long term senior unsecured credit ratings 
no support from government funding facilities 
a combination of contractual outflows  such as upcoming maturities of unsecured debt  and contingent outflows eg  actions though not contractually required  we may deem necessary in a crisis 
we assume that most contingent outflows will occur within the initial days and weeks of a crisis 

table of contents jefferies group  inc 
and subsidiaries continued no diversification benefit across liquidity risks 
we assume that liquidity risks are additive 
the calculation of our maximum liquidity outflow under the above stresses and modeling parameters considers the following potential contractual and contingent cash and collateral outflows all upcoming maturities of unsecured long term debt  commercial paper  promissory notes and other unsecured funding products assuming we will be unable to issue new unsecured debt or rollover any maturing debt 
repurchases of our outstanding long term debt in the ordinary course of business as a market maker 
a portion of upcoming contractual maturities of secured funding trades due to either the inability to refinance or the ability to refinance only at wider haircuts ie  on terms which require us to post additional collateral 
our assumptions reflect  among other factors  the quality of the underlying collateral and counterparty concentration 
collateral postings to counterparties due to adverse changes in the value of our otc derivatives and other outflows due to trade terminations  collateral substitutions  collateral disputes  collateral calls or termination payments required by a two notch downgrade in our credit ratings 
variation margin postings required due to adverse changes in the value of our outstanding exchange traded derivatives and any increase in initial margin and guarantee fund requirements by derivative clearing houses 
liquidity outflows associated with our prime brokerage business  including withdrawals of customer credit balances  and a reduction in customer short positions 
liquidity outflows to clearing banks to ensure timely settlements of cash and securities transactions 
draws on our unfunded commitments considering  among other things  the type of commitment and counterparty 
other upcoming large cash outflows  such as tax payments 
based on the sources and uses of liquidity calculated under the maximum liquidity outflow scenarios we determine  based on a calculated surplus or deficit additional long term funding that may be needed versus funding through the repurchase financing market and consider any adjustments that may be necessary to our inventory balances and cash holdings 
at november   we have sufficient excess liquidity to meet all contingent cash outflows detailed in the maximum liquidity outflow 
we regularly refine our model to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and the firm s business mix 

table of contents jefferies group  inc 
and subsidiaries continued sources of liquidity we continue to maintain significant cash balances on hand 
the following are financial instruments that are cash and cash equivalents or are deemed by management to be generally readily convertible into cash  marginable or accessible for liquidity purposes within a relatively short period of time in thousands as of november  average balance quarter ended november  as of november  cash and cash equivalents cash in banks money market investments total cash and cash equivalents other sources of liquidity securities purchased under agreements to resell uk liquidity pool other total other sources total cash and cash equivalents and other liquidity sources average balances are calculated based on weekly balances

other includes unencumbered inventory representing an estimate of the amount of additional secured financing that could be reasonably expected to be obtained from our financial instruments owned that are currently not pledged after considering reasonable financing haircuts and additional funds available under the committed senior secured revolving credit facility available for working capital needs of jefferies bache 
during november  we sought to increase our liquidity and cash balances in order to demonstrate our liquidity and financial stability 
accordingly  we liquidated various trading positions and reduced the overall size of our financial instruments inventory from the prior third quarter end and held the proceeds in cash balances 

table of contents jefferies group  inc 
and subsidiaries continued in addition to the cash balances and liquidity pool presented above  the majority of financial instruments both long and short in our trading accounts are actively traded and readily marketable 
we have the ability to readily obtain repurchase financing for of our inventory at haircuts of or less  which reflects the marketability of our inventory 
we continually assess the liquidity of our inventory based on the level at which we could obtain financing in the market place for a given asset 
assets are considered to be liquid if financing can be obtained in the repurchase market or the securities lending market at collateral haircut levels of or less 
the following summarizes our financial instruments by asset class that we consider to be of a liquid nature and the amount of such assets that have not been pledged as collateral at november  and november  in thousands november  november  liquid financial instruments unencumbered liquid financial instruments liquid financial instruments unencumbered liquid financial instruments corporate equity securities corporate debt securities us government  and agency securities other sovereign obligations agency mortgage and asset backed securities physical commodities consists solely of agency mortgage backed securities issued by freddiemac  fanniemae and ginniemae 
these securities include pass through securities  securities backed by adjustable rate mortgages arms  collateralized mortgage obligations  commercial mortgage backed securities and interest and principal only securities 
unencumbered liquid balances represent assets that can be sold or used as collateral for a loan  but have not been 
average liquid financial instruments for the three months ended november  were approximately billion 
in addition to being able to be readily financed at modest haircut levels  we estimate that each of the individual securities within each asset class could be sold into the market and converted into cash within three business days under normal market conditions  assuming that the entire portfolio of a given asset class was not simultaneously liquidated 
there are no restrictions on the unencumbered liquid securities  nor have they been pledged as collateral 
sources of funding and capital resources our assets are funded by equity capital  senior debt  convertible debt  mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock  mandatorily redeemable preferred interests  securities loaned  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  customer free credit balances  bank loans and other payables 
secured financing we rely principally on secured and readily available funding to finance our inventory of financial instruments 
our ability to support increases in total assets is largely a function of our ability to obtain short term secured funding  primarily through securities financing transactions 
we do not use or rely on wholesale funding  a catch all term typically used to refer to unsecured short term funding  such as brokered deposits  
table of contents jefferies group  inc 
and subsidiaries continued foreign deposits or commercial paper 
we finance a portion of our long inventory and cover some of our short inventory by pledging and borrowing securities in the form of repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements collectively repos  respectively 
approximately of our repurchase financing activities use collateral that is considered eligible collateral by central clearing corporations 
central clearing corporations are situated between participating members who borrow cash and lend securities or vice versa  accordingly repo participants contract with the central clearing corporation and not one another individually 
therefore  counterparty credit risk is borne by the central clearing corporation which mitigates the risk through initial margin demands and variation margin calls from repo participants 
the comparatively large proportion of our total repo activity that is eligible for central clearing reflects the high quality and liquid composition of the inventory we carry in our trading books 
the tenor of our repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements generally exceeds the expected holding period of the assets we are financing 
during the first ten months of fiscal  and despite the increasingly uncertain economic situation in europe and elsewhere  we continued to gain access to additional liquidity providers and increased funding availability both in terms of asset classes being financed and the term of the financing being offered 
near the end of the third quarter  given the instability and possible credit tightening of european banks  we began to execute more of our financing of european sovereign inventory using central clearinghouse financing arrangements rather than via bi lateral arrangements repo agreements 
for those asset classes not eligible for central clearinghouse financing  we successfully increased the term of the bi lateral financings 
the remaining of our outstanding repo balances is currently contracted bi laterally of which a significant portion is on a term basis 
the following table provides detail on the composition of our outstanding repurchase agreements at november  in millions repo profile by instrument type contract type total contract amount clearing organization eligible of total non eligible of total treasury sovereign agency debt agency mbs non agency mbs abs corporate debt municipal other this is also augmented by our million of uncommitted secured and unsecured bank lines  comprised of million of bank lines and million of letters of credit 
secured amounts are collateralized by a combination of customer and firm securities 
letters of credit are used in the normal course of business mostly to satisfy various collateral requirements in favor of exchanges in lieu of depositing cash or securities 
short term borrowings bank loans represent temporary usually overnight secured and unsecured short term borrowings  which are generally payable on demand and generally bear interest at a spread over the federal funds rate 
bank loans that are unsecured are typically overnight loans used to finance financial instruments owned or clearing related balances 
we had million for debt securities sold as part of our us broker dealer s market making in our long term debt as of november  and no outstanding secured or unsecured bank loans as of november  average daily bank loans for the twelve months ended november  and the eleven months ended november  were million and million  respectively

in ensuring a stable and adequate long term capital base  we raised million of common equity in april  and in connection with our announcement of the million acquisition of prudential bache s global commodities group  in april  we raised million of additional common equity and million in unsecured senior notes with a maturity of years 
on august  we entered into a committed senior secured revolving credit facility credit facility with a group of commercial banks in dollars  euros and sterling  in aggregate totaling million  of which million can be borrowed unsecured 
at november   we had borrowings outstanding under the credit facility amounting to million

throughout the period  no instances of noncompliance with the credit facility occurred 
we expect to remain in compliance both in the near term and long term given our current liquidity  anticipated additional funding requirements given our business plan and profitability expectations 
while our subsidiaries are restricted under the credit facility from incurring additional indebtedness beyond trade payable and derivative liabilities in the normal course of business  we do not believe that these restrictions will have a negative impact on our liquidity 
we issued million and million in unsecured senior notes in june and july with maturities of approximately years and million in unsecured senior notes in november with a maturity of years

additionally  our us broker dealer  from time to time  makes a market in our long term debt securities ie  purchases and sells our long term debt securities 
during november  there was extreme volatility in the price of our debt and a significant amount of secondary trading volume through our market making desk 
given the volume of activity and significant price volatility  purchases of our debt have been treated as debt extinguishments and sales have been treated as reissuances of debt 
as a result  we recognized a gain of million as a gain on debt extinguishment reported in other income for the twelve months ended november  additionally  the balance of long term debt was reduced by million as a result of the repurchase activity 
at november   an obligation to deliver long term debt securities of million is outstanding for debt securities sold and accordingly treated as reissuances of debt securities  which are reported as short term borrowings on the consolidated statement of financial condition

vies are entities in which equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
vies are consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the party who has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and who has an obligation to absorb losses of the entity or a right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity 
where we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  such as is the case with jefferies high yield holdings  llc  we consolidate the vie 
we do not generally consolidate the various vies related to our mortgage backed securities securitization activities because we are not the primary beneficiary 
at november   we did not have any commitments to purchase assets from our securitization vehicles 
at november   we held million of mortgage backed securities issued by vies for which we were initially involved as transferor and placement agent  which are accounted for at fair value and recorded within financial instruments owned on our consolidated statement of financial condition in the same manner as our other financial instruments

risk management risk is an inherent part of our business and activities 
the extent to which we properly and effectively identify  assess  monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our activities is critical to our financial soundness  viability and profitability 
accordingly  we have a comprehensive risk management approach  with a formal governance structure and processes to identify  assess  monitor and manage risk 
principal risks involved in our business activities include market  credit  liquidity and capital  operational  legal and compliance  new business  and reputational risk 

table of contents jefferies group  inc

accordingly  our risk management process encompasses the active involvement of executive and senior management  and also many departments independent of the revenue producing business units  including the risk management  operations  compliance  legal and finance departments 
our risk management policies  procedures and methodologies are fluid in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
for discussion of liquidity and capital risk management refer to  liquidity  financial condition and capital resources within item management s discussion and analysis in this annual report on form k 
governance and risk management structure our board of directors our board of directors plays an important role in reviewing our risk management process and risk tolerance 
our board of directors is provided with data relating to risk at each of its regularly scheduled meetings 
our chief risk officer meets with the board of directors at each of those meetings to present his views and to respond to questions 
risk committees we make extensive use of internal committees to govern risk taking and ensure that business activities are properly identified  assessed  monitored and managed 
our risk management committee meets weekly to discuss our risk  capital  and liquidity profile in detail 
in addition  business or market trends and their potential impact on the risk profile are discussed 
membership is comprised of our chief executive officer and chairman  chairman of the executive committee  chief financial officer  chief risk officer and treasurer 
the committee approves limits for us as a whole  and across risk categories and business lines 
it also reviews all limit breaches 
limits are reviewed on at least an annual basis 
other risk related committees include market risk management  credit risk management  new business  underwriting acceptance  margin oversight  executive management and operating committees 
these committees govern risk taking and ensure that business activities are properly managed for their area of oversight 
risk related policies we make use of various policies in the risk management process market risk policy this policy sets out roles  responsibilities  processes and escalation procedures regarding market risk management 
independent price verification policy this policy sets out roles  responsibilities  processes and escalation procedures regarding independent price verification for securities and other financial instruments 
operational risk policy this policy sets out roles  responsibilities  processes and escalation procedures regarding operational risk management 
credit risk policy this policy provides standards and controls for credit risk taking throughout our global business activities 
this policy also governs credit limit methodology and counterparty review 
risk management key metrics we apply a comprehensive framework of limits on a variety of key metrics to constrain the risk profile of our business activities 
the size of the limit reflects our risk tolerance for a certain activity under normal business conditions 
key metrics included in our framework include inventory position and exposure limits on a gross and net basis  scenario analysis and stress tests  value at risk  sensitivities greeks  exposure concentrations  aged inventory  amount of level assets  counterparty exposure  leverage  cash capital  and performance analysis metrics 

table of contents jefferies group  inc 
and subsidiaries continued market risk the potential for changes in the value of financial instruments is referred to as market risk 
our market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from a change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices  commodity prices and foreign exchange rates  along with the level of volatility 
interest rate risks result primarily from exposure to changes in the yield curve  the volatility of interest rates  and credit spreads 
equity price risks result from exposure to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  equity baskets and equity indices 
commodity price risks result from exposure to the changes in prices and volatilities of individual commodities  commodity baskets and commodity indices 
market risk arises from market making  proprietary trading  underwriting  specialist and investing activities 
we seek to manage our exposure to market risk by diversifying exposures  controlling position sizes  and establishing economic hedges in related securities or derivatives 
due to imperfections in correlations  gains and losses can occur even for positions that are hedged 
position limits in trading and inventory accounts are established and monitored on an ongoing basis 
each day  consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed to various levels of management  which enable management to monitor inventory levels and results of the trading groups 
value at risk we estimate value at risk var using a model that simulates revenue and loss distributions on substantially all financial instruments by applying historical market changes to the current portfolio 
using the results of this simulation  var measures the potential loss in value of our financial instruments over a specified time horizon at a given confidence level 
we calculate a one day var using a one year look back period measured at a confidence level 
this implies that  on average  we expect to realize a loss of daily trading net revenue at least as large as the var amount on one out of every twenty trading days 
as with all measures of var  our estimate has inherent limitations due to the assumption that historical changes in market conditions are representative of the future 
furthermore  the var model measures the risk of a current static position over a one day horizon and might not capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges in a one day period 
published var results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions 
while we believe the assumptions and inputs in our risk model are reasonable  we could incur losses greater than the reported var because the historical market prices and rates changes may not be an accurate measure of future market events and conditions 
consequently  this var estimate is only one of a number of tools we use in our daily risk management activities 
when comparing our var numbers to those of other firms  it is important to remember that different methodologies and assumptions could produce significantly different results 
the var numbers below are shown separately for interest rate  equity  currency and commodity products  as well as for our overall trading positions  excluding corporate investments in asset management positions  using the past days of historical date 
the aggregated var presented here is less than the sum of the individual components ie  interest rate risk  foreign exchange rate risk  equity risk and commodity price risk due to the benefit of diversification among the risk categories 
diversification benefit equals the difference between 
table of contents jefferies group  inc 
and subsidiaries continued aggregated var and the sum of vars for the four risk categories and arises because the market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
the following table illustrates the var for each component of market risk 
daily var value at risk in trading portfolios november  twelve months ended november  eleven months ended november  risk categories average high low average high low in millions interest rates equity prices currency rates commodity prices diversification effect firmwide var is the potential loss in value of our trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specific confidence level 
for the var numbers reported above  a one day time horizon  with a one year look back period  and a confidence level were used 
average var of million during the twelve months ended november  increased from the million average during the eleven months ended november  due mainly to higher fixed income exposure 
var of at november  reflects a decrease as we significantly reduced our balance sheet and risk at year end 
the chart below reflects our daily var over the last four quarters logo the comparison of actual daily net revenue fluctuations with the daily var estimate is the primary method used to test the efficacy of the var model 
this is performed at various levels of the trading portfolio  from the holding company level down to specific business lines 
at a confidence one day var model  net trading losses would not be expected to exceed var estimates more than twelve times out of days on an annual basis 
trading related revenue is defined as principal transaction revenue  trading related commissions and net interest income 
results of the process at the aggregate level demonstrated two days when the net trading loss exceeded the one day var in the twelve months ended november  the var excesses were realized on august  and august   as previously disclosed in our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended august  
table of contents jefferies group  inc 
and subsidiaries continued daily net trading revenue in millions the chart below presents the distribution of our daily net trading revenue for substantially all of our trading activities for the twelve months ended november  logo there were days with trading losses out of a total of trading days in the twelve months ended november   of which days with trading losses occurred in the third quarter of fiscal as a result of the exceptionally difficult trading conditions in the major markets during that period 
scenario analysis and stress tests we use stress testing to analyze the impact of specific market moves on our current portfolio both firmwide and within business segments 
we employ a range of scenarios to estimate the potential loss from extreme market moves or stressful market environments 
the scenarios comprise both historical market moves and hypothetical market environments  and they generally involve simultaneous moves of many risk factors 
indicative market moves in our scenarios include  but are not limited to  a large widening of credit spreads  a substantial decline in equities markets  significant moves in selected emerging markets  large moves in interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve and large moves in european markets 
because our stress scenarios are meant to reflect market moves that occur over a period of time  our estimates of potential loss assume some level of position reduction for liquid positions 
unlike our var  which measures potential losses within a given confidence interval  stress scenarios do not have an associated implied probability  rather  stress testing is used to estimate the potential loss from market moves that tend to be larger than those embedded in the var calculation 
stress testing is performed and reported regularly as part of the risk management process 
in addition  we also perform ad hoc stress tests and add new scenarios as market conditions dictate 
stress testing is used to asses our aggregate risk position as well as for limit setting and risk reward analysis 
counterparty credit risk and issuer country exposure counterparty credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a counterparty s credit worthiness or its ability or willingness to meet its financial obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of a financial contract 

table of contents jefferies group  inc 
and subsidiaries continued we are exposed to credit risk as trading counterparty to other broker dealers and customers  as a direct lender and through extending loan commitments  as a holder of securities and as a member of exchanges and clearing organizations 
it is critical to our financial soundness and profitability that we properly and effectively identify  assess  monitor  and manage the various credit and counterparty risks inherent in our businesses 
credit is extended to counterparties in a controlled manner in order to generate acceptable returns  whether such credit is granted directly or is incidental to a transaction 
all extensions of credit are monitored and managed on an enterprise level in order to limit exposure to loss related to credit risk 
our credit risk framework is responsible for identifying credit risks throughout the operating businesses  establishing counterparty limits and managing and monitoring those credit limits 
our framework includes defining credit limit guidelines and credit limit approval processes  providing a consistent and integrated credit risk framework across the enterprise  approving counterparties and counterparty limits with parameters set by the risk management committee  negotiating  approving and monitoring credit terms in legal and master documentation  delivering credit limits to all relevant sales and trading desks  maintaining credit reviews for all active and new counterparties  operating a control function for exposure analytics and exception management and reporting  determining the analytical standards and risk parameters for on going management and monitoring of global credit risk books  actively managing daily exposure  exceptions  and breaches  monitoring daily margin call activity and counterparty performance in concert with the margin department  and setting the minimum global requirements for systems  reports  and technology 
credit exposures credit exposure exists across a wide range of products including cash and cash equivalents  loans  securities finance transactions and over the counter derivative contracts

cash and cash equivalents include both interest bearing and non interest bearing deposits at banks 
current counterparty credit exposures at november  and november  are summarized in the table below and provided by industry  credit quality and region 
credit exposures presented take netting and collateral into consideration by counterparty and master agreement 
current exposure is the loss that would be incurred on a particular set of positions in the event of default by the counterparty  assuming no recovery

this table is presented in a manner consistent with how management views and monitors these exposures as part of our risk management framework 
our issuer exposure to these european countries arises primarily in the context of our market making activities and our role as a major dealer in the debt securities of these countries 
accordingly  our issuer risk arises due to holding securities as long and short inventory  which does not carry counterparty credit exposure 
while the economic derivative hedges are presented on a notional basis  we believe this best reflects the reduction in the underlying market risk due to interest rates or the issuer s credit as a result of the hedges 
long and short financial instruments are offset against each other for determining net exposure although they do not represent identical offsetting positions of the same debt security 
components of risk embedded in the securities will generally offset  however  basis risk due to duration and the specific issuer may still exist 
economic hedges as represented by the notional amounts of the derivative contracts may not be perfect offsets for the risk represented by the net fair value of the debt securities

short securities represent the fair value of debt securities sold short and are presented within financial instruments sold  not yet purchased corporate debt securities and government  federal agency and other sovereign obligations on the face of the balance sheet and are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in principal transactions revenues 
net derivative contracts reflect the notional amount of the derivative contracts and include credit default swaps  bond futures and listed equity options
