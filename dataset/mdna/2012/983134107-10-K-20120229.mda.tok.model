in response to our evaluation of our macau operations and the reactions of our guests  we have made and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to this resort complex 
future development approximately acres of land comprising our las vegas operations is currently improved with a golf course 
while we may develop this property in the future  we have no immediate plans to do so 
in september  palo real estate company limited and wynn resorts macau sa  each an indirect subsidiary of wynn macau limited  formally accepted the terms and conditions of a draft land concession contract from the macau government  and in december made a million initial deposit for approximately acres of land in the cotai area of macau 
following government approval  we anticipate constructing a full scale integrated resort containing a casino  approximately  hotel suites  convention  retail  entertainment and food and beverage offerings on this land 
we continue to finalize the project scope  timeline and budget 
results of operations our operating results in macau were significantly higher in as the macau market continued to grow  and the las vegas market began to improve with increased levels of gaming revenue  visitation  and hotel room demand 
our results for the years presented are not comparable as the year ended december  includes a full year of operations for encore at wynn macau which opened on april  the table below presents our net revenues amounts in thousands for the years ended december  net revenues las vegas operations macau operations 
table of contents reliance on only two resort complexes in two geographic regions for our operating cash flow exposes us to certain risks that competitors  whose operations are more geographically diversified  may be better able to control 
in addition to the concentration of operations in two resort complexes  many of our customers are premium gaming customers who wager on credit  thus exposing us to increased credit risk 
high end gaming also increases the potential for variability in our results 
operating measures certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which a consolidated statement of income is presented 
there are two methods used to calculate win percentage in the casino industry 
in las vegas and in the general casino in macau  customers usually purchase cash chips at the gaming tables 
the cash and net markers used to purchase the cash chips are deposited in the gaming table s drop box 
this is the base of measurement that we use in the casino at our las vegas operations and in the general casino at our macau operations for calculating win percentage 
in our vip casino in macau  customers primarily purchase non negotiable chips  commonly referred to as rolling chips  from the casino cage and there is no deposit into a gaming table drop box from chips purchased from the cage 
non negotiable chips can only be used to make wagers 
winning wagers are paid in cash chips 
the loss of the non negotiable chips in the vip casino is recorded as turnover and provides a base for calculating vip casino win percentage 
because of this difference in chip purchase activity  the measurement base used in the general casino is not the same that is used in the vip casino 
it is customary in macau to measure vip casino play using this rolling chip method 
the measurement method in las vegas and in the general casino in macau tracks the initial purchase of chips at the table while the measurement method in our vip casino in macau tracks the sum of all losing wagers 
accordingly  the base measurement in the vip casino is much larger than the general casino 
as a result  the expected win percentage with the same amount of gaming win is smaller in the vip casino in macau when compared to the general casino in las vegas and macau 
even though both use the same measurement method  we experience different win percentages in the general casino activity in las vegas versus macau 
this difference is primarily due to the difference in the mix of table games and customer playing habits between the two casinos 
each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage 
in the second quarter of  we increased our expectations for table games win percentage in the general casino at wynn macau from to based on our experience since the opening of the encore at wynn macau expansion 
below are definitions of the statistics discussed table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue 
drop is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table s drop box 
turnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our macau vip program 
rolling chips are identifiable chips that are used to track vip wagering volume turnover for purposes of calculating incentives 
slot win is the amount of handle representing the total amount wagered that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenue 
average daily rate adr is calculated by dividing total room revenue less service charges  if any by total rooms occupied 
revenue per available room revpar is calculated by dividing total room revenue less service charges  if any by total rooms available

our average table games win percentage before discounts for the year ended december  was  which was above the expected range of to and compares to for the prior year

our macau operations experienced an million increase in casino revenues to  million for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
our vip revenue segment increased due to a increase in turnover  offset by a lower win percentage  all compared to the prior year 
our win as a percent of turnover was  which is within our expected range of to  and compares to in the prior year 
for the year ended december   we benefited from an increase in the number of vip tables and a full year of operations from encore at wynn macau which opened in april in our general casino  drop increased when compared to the prior year and the average table games win percentage was  which is slightly above our expected range of to 
the average table game win percentage for the year ended december  was 
slot machine handle increased compared to the prior year as a result of increased visitation to our resort and a full year of operations for encore at wynn macau

room revenue at our las vegas operations increased million compared to the prior year 
in las vegas  we experienced an increase in room rates during the year ended december   compared to the prior year  with a percentage point decrease in occupancy rate 
we were able to achieve an increase in adr as we adjusted rates to attract a higher quality customer who would take advantage of all aspects of our resort 
room revenue at our macau operations increased million due to increases in both occupancy rate and room rates compared to the prior year  as well as the inclusion of a full year of the additional suites added with the opening of encore at wynn macau in april the table below sets forth key operating measures related to room revenue

other non gaming revenues for the year ended december   included food and beverage revenues of million  retail revenues of million  entertainment revenues of million  and other revenues from outlets  including the spa and salon  of million 
food and beverage revenues at our las vegas operations increased million  while our macau operations increased million  as compared to the prior year 
the increase in las vegas is due primarily to business in our nightclubs including the full year of operations for the encore beach club and surrender nightclub which opened in may and increases in our catering and restaurant business 
the increase in macau is due to increased visitation to our resort and a full year of operations from encore at wynn macau which opened in april retail revenues at our macau operations increased million  while retail at our las vegas operations increased by million 
the increase at wynn macau is due primarily to strong same store sales growth and the addition of three new boutiques at encore at wynn macau 
entertainment revenues increased million over the prior year primarily due to increased revenue from garth brooks  who performs in the encore theater  and the sinatra dance with me show  both in las vegas 
the sinatra dance with me show ended its run on april  departmental  administrative and other expenses for the year ended december   departmental expenses included casino expenses of  million  room expenses of million  food and beverage expenses of million  and entertainment  retail and other expenses of million 
also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately million and million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable 
for the year ended december   departmental expenses included casino expenses of  million  room expenses of million  food and beverage expenses of million  and entertainment  retail and other expenses of million 
also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately million and approximately million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable 
casino expenses have increased during the year ended december  due to an increase in casino revenues at both of our las vegas operations and at our macau operations where we incur a gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling in accordance with the concession agreement 
although our room revenues increased  room expenses increased only as the revenue increase was driven primarily by increased adr 
food and beverage and entertainment  retail and other expenses increased commensurate with the increase in revenues 
the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts relates primarily to wynn las vegas and is a result of the higher casino revenue base experienced during the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
pre opening costs we incurred no pre opening costs during the year ended december  for the year ended december   we incurred million of pre opening costs primarily related to encore at wynn macau which opened on april  and the encore beach club and surrender nightclub which opened in las vegas on may  depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   was million compared to million for the year ended december  while there was little change between periods  depreciation expense decreased due to assets with a year life being fully depreciated as of september at wynn macau and assets with a year life being fully depreciated as of april at wynn las vegas 
these decreases were offset by additional depreciation for the assets of encore at wynn macau which were placed into service in april and the assets of the encore beach club and surrender nightclub in las vegas which were placed into service in may 
table of contents during the construction of our resorts  costs incurred in the construction of the buildings  improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized 
once these resorts opened  their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense 
depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets 
in addition  we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment  intangibles and other assets and adjust them when warranted 
the maximum useful life of assets at our macau operations is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession  which currently expire in june and august  respectively 
consequently  depreciation related to our macau operations is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to our las vegas operations 
property charges and other property charges and other for the year ended december   were million compared to million for the year ended december  property charges and other for the year ended december  include a charge of million reflecting the present value of a charitable contribution made by wynn macau to the university of macau development foundation 
this contribution consists of a million payment made in may  and a commitment for additional donations of million each year for the calendar years through inclusive  for a total of million 
the amount reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of income has been discounted using our then estimated borrowing rate over the time period of the remaining committed payments 
also included are the write off of certain off site golf memberships by wynn las vegas  miscellaneous renovations and abandonments at our resorts  including modifications of the encore at wynn las vegas and wynn macau retail esplanades  closure of the blush nightclub and the write off of certain costs related to a show that ended its run in las vegas in april property charges and other for the year ended december   include a contract termination payment of million related to a management contract for certain of the nightclubs at wynn las vegas and miscellaneous renovations  abandonments and gain loss on sale of equipment at our resorts 
other non operating costs and expenses interest income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during and  our short term investment strategy has been to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity 
while the majority of our short term investments were primarily in money market accounts  us treasury bills and time deposits with a maturity of three months or less  beginning in may we have invested in certain corporate bond securities and commercial paper which contributed to the increase in interest income 
interest expense was million  net of capitalized interest of  for the year ended december   compared to million  net of capitalized interest of million  for the year ended december  our interest expense increased compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in interest capitalized and an increase in interest rates on our first mortgage notes  offset by a decrease in amounts outstanding under our wynn las vegas and wynn macau bank credit revolving facilities compared to the prior year 
changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase decrease in swap fair value in each period 
we recorded a gain of million for the year ended december   resulting from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from december  to december  for the year ended december   we recorded an expense of million resulting from the decrease in the fair value of interest rate swaps between december  and december  for further information on our interest rate swaps  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in april  we completed an exchange offer for a portion of our outstanding first mortgage notes the notes 
in connection with that exchange offer  the direct costs incurred with third parties of million were expensed 
in august  we completed a tender offer for the then outstanding notes 
table of contents and subsequent call of all the remaining amounts once the tender was completed 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million 
this included the tender offer consideration  the call premium and the related write off of the unamortized debt issue costs and original issue discount 
income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded a tax benefit of million 
our income tax benefit is primarily related to tax benefits resulting from an increase in our deferred tax assets  a decrease in our liability for uncertain tax positions as the result of the statute of limitations lapse reduced by foreign taxes assessable on the dividends of wynn macau  sa and foreign tax provisions related to our international marketing offices 
since june   we have no longer considered our portion of the tax earnings and profits of wynn macau  limited to be permanently invested 
no additional us tax provision has been made with respect to amounts not considered permanently invested as we anticipate that us foreign tax credits should be sufficient to eliminate any us tax provision relating to such repatriation 
to the extent that book earnings exceed the tax earnings and profits of wynn macau  limited  such excess is considered permanently invested 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized income tax benefits related to excess tax deductions associated with stock compensation costs of million and million  respectively 
effective september   wynn macau  sa received a year exemption from macau s complementary tax on casino gaming profits 
on november   wynn macau  sa received an additional year exemption through december  accordingly  we were exempted from the payment of approximately million and million in such taxes for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our non gaming profits remain subject to the macau complementary tax and casino winnings remain subject to the macau special gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling in accordance with our concession agreement 
during the year ended december   wynn macau  sa received the results of the macau finance bureau s examination of its and macau complementary tax returns and filed an appeal related to the examination s disallowance of certain deductions claimed in its macau complementary tax return 
in august  the macau tax issues under appeal were resolved 
as part of the settlement  the company paid million in macau complementary tax substantially all of which was provided for in prior years 
as the result of the resolution of these macau tax issues and expiration of the statute of limitations for macau complementary tax assessments on december   the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased million 
during  we received the results of an irs examination of our through us income tax returns and filed an appeal of the examination s findings with the appellate division of the irs 
in connection with that appeal  we agreed to extend the statute of limitations for our and us income tax returns to december  the issues under examination in these years are temporary differences and relate to the treatment of discounts extended to las vegas casino customers gambling on credit  the deduction of certain costs incurred during the development and construction of encore at wynn las vegas and the appropriate tax depreciation recovery periods applicable to certain assets 
upon the settlement of these issues  unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by to million 
the resolution of the  and examination is not expected to result in any significant cash payment but rather the utilization of a portion of our foreign tax credit carryforward 
during the fourth quarter of  the irs commenced an examination of our us income tax return 
we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions related to the period covered by the examination is adequate 
the resolution of the irs examination is not expected to result in any significant cash payment  but rather the utilization of a portion of our foreign tax credit carryforward 

table of contents during october  the irs began an examination of our us income tax return 
since the examination is in its initial stages we are unable to determine if it will be concluded within the next twelve months 
we believe our liability for uncertain tax positions related to the period covered by this examination is adequate 
we are participating in the irs compliance assurance program cap for the tax year 
under the cap program  the irs and the taxpayer work together in a pre filing environment to examine transactions and issues and thus complete the tax examination before the tax return is filed 
participation in this program should enable us to reduce time spent on tax administration and enhance tax reserve and financial statement reporting integrity 
in january  we received notification that we had been accepted into the irs cap for the tax year

in las vegas  we continued to experience a decrease in room rates during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  we believe this was due to the economic conditions in the us and the increased capacity in the las vegas market including the opening of a new large scale casino hotel in las vegas in december in addition  in july  we commenced a project to remodel all of the rooms at wynn las vegas 
accordingly  we had fewer room nights available during the year ended december  which had a negative impact on our room revenues in las vegas

the tax provision recorded for the valuation allowance increases was reduced by an income tax benefit recorded for the loss from our us operations 
as of june   we no longer consider our portion of the tax earnings and profits of wynn macau  limited to be permanently reinvested 
no additional us tax provision has been made with respect to this amount as we anticipate that us foreign tax credits should be sufficient to eliminate any us tax provision relating to such repatriation 
prior to this change  our earnings attributable to periods after september  were considered permanently reinvested abroad

adjusted property ebitda we use adjusted property ebitda to manage the operating results of our segments 
adjusted property ebitda is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  pre opening costs  property charges and other  corporate expenses  stock based compensation  and other non operating income and expenses  and includes equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates 
adjusted property ebitda is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that it is widely used to measure the performance  and as a basis for valuation  of gaming companies 
we use adjusted property ebitda as a measure of the operating performance of our segments and to compare the operating performance of our properties with those of our competitors 
we also present adjusted property ebitda because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company s ability to incur and service debt  make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements 
gaming companies have historically reported ebitda as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand alone basis  gaming companies  including us  have historically excluded from their ebitda calculations pre opening expenses  property charges and corporate expenses that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties 
however  adjusted property ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance  as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity  or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
unlike net income  adjusted property ebitda does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital 
we have significant uses of cash flows  including capital expenditures  interest payments  debt principal repayments  taxes and other non recurring charges  which are not reflected in adjusted property ebitda 
also  our calculation of adjusted property ebitda may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be limited 

table of contents the following table amounts in thousands summarizes adjusted property ebitda for our las vegas and macau operations as reviewed by management and summarized in item notes to consolidated financial statement note segment information 
that footnote also presents a reconciliation of adjusted property ebitda to net income

while we benefited from higher win percentages on our table games and higher non casino revenues for the year  the economic environment in the las vegas market is still uncertain 
our macau operations adjusted property ebitda has increased as the macau market continues to grow and as a result of our expansion of that resort as detailed in the discussions above regarding our results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations our operating cash flows primarily consist of our operating income generated by our las vegas and macau operations excluding depreciation and other non cash charges  interest paid  and changes in working capital accounts such as receivables  inventories  prepaid expenses  and payables 
our table games play both in macau and las vegas is a mix of cash play and credit play  while our slot machine play is conducted primarily on a cash basis 
a portion of our table games revenue is attributable to the play of a limited number of premium international customers that gamble on credit 
the ability to collect these gaming receivables may impact our operating cash flow for the period

accordingly  operating cash flows will be impacted by changes in operating income and accounts receivables 
net cash provided from operations for the year ended december  was billion compared to billion provided by operations for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the increase in operating income as a result of increased operating department profitability at both our las vegas operations and our macau operations  especially in the casino  room and food and beverage departments
