edison international s earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the united states 
management uses core earnings by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance 
core earnings losses by principal operating subsidiary are also used when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the company s performance from period to period 
core earnings losses are a non gaap financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies 
core earnings losses are defined as earnings attributable to edison international shareholders less income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings  such as exit activities  including lease terminations  sale of certain assets  early debt extinguishment costs and other activities that are no longer continuing  asset impairments and certain tax  regulatory or legal settlements or proceedings 
sce s core earnings increased million primarily due to rate base growth 
emg s core earnings declined million due to lower realized energy and capacity prices along with lower

accomplishing this mission requires balancing competing priorities  including public policies regarding air and water quality  energy efficiency and renewable energy and the need to replace aging infrastructure 
the accumulation of several major policy mandates is expected to add significantly to the cost of electric service  which could cause a growing number of customers to seek to self generate their power 
choices by customers to self generate results in fewer kilowatt hour sales to absorb the increasing costs of the electrical system  further increasing rates for sce s other customers 
working with policy makers to balance competing priorities  a key focus of sce is to manage the costs that drive increases in electricity rates while delivering safe and reliable electric service to its customers 
cpuc general rate case sce filed its grc application in november in october  sce submitted updated testimony to reflect changes in escalation rates  known changes due to governmental actions and changes in the timing of recovery for nuclear refueling outages at san onofre  which taken together changed its requested base rate revenue requirement to billion 
sce s updated request  after considering the effects of sales growth and including the impacts of reducing sce s solar program as approved by the cpuc  would result in incremental customer base rate increases of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the division of ratepayer advocates dra recommended that sce s requested base rate revenue requirement be decreased by approximately million  comprised of approximately million in operation and maintenance expense reductions and approximately million in capital related revenue requirement reductions 
the utility reform network turn and other intervenors recommended an additional million revenue requirement reduction  beyond the dra adjustments  primarily capital related in nature  as well as disallowances of recorded capital investments for specific projects 
intervenors have also recommended changes to sce s proposed post test year ratemaking methodology to be used for and as well as limiting the recovery amount of sce s pension costs 
a final decision on the grc is expected in the first half of the cpuc has authorized the establishment of a grc memorandum account  which will make the revenue requirement ultimately adopted by the cpuc effective as of january  recognition of the revenue for the 
table of contents period january  through the date of a final decision  as well as any delays in certain expenditures  may impact the timing of earnings in ferc formula rates the ferc has accepted  subject to refund and settlement procedures  sce s request to implement formula rates as a means to determine sce s ferc transmission revenue requirement effective january  the formula rates include revenue requirements related to construction work in progress cwip that was previously recovered through a separate mechanism 
sce estimates its total ferc weighted average roe will be  including the previously authorized basis point incentive for caiso participation and individual authorized project incentives 
the actual weighted average roe and rate base is dependent upon the amount and timing of capital expenditures among ferc incentive and non incentive projects 
sce s request proposed the adoption of a specific formula to calculate a forecasted annual revenue requirement that is used to establish rates and is trued up annually to allow sce to recover its actual revenue requirement  including its actual cost of service  actual rate base and the authorized return on investment 
sce s request also allows sce to make single issue rate filings requesting changes to certain elements of the formula  including the base roe  depreciation rates and the retail rate structure 
sce and the other parties to the proceeding are currently in settlement negotiations 
capital program during  sce continued execution of its capital investment program 
total capital expenditures including accruals were billion in compared to billion in the level of future spending is significantly dependent on a final outcome of sce s grc decision and the timing  scope and approvals of major transmission projects 
sce s capital program for is focused primarily in the following areas maintaining reliability and expanding the capability of sce s transmission and distribution system 
upgrading and constructing new transmission lines and substations for system reliability and increased access to renewable energy  including the tehachapi  devers colorado river  eldorado ivanpah  and red bluff projects 
completing installation of digital meters in households and small businesses  referred to as edisonsmartconnect tm 
through  sce installed million meters and plans to install the remaining million meters during generation capital projects for nuclear and hydro electric plants 
sce forecasts capital expenditures in the range of billion to billion for actual capital spending will be affected by changes in regulatory  environmental and engineering design requirements  permitting and project delays  cost and availability of labor  equipment and materials  and other factors as discussed further under sce liquidity and capital resources capital investment plan 
sce has experienced significant cost pressures on its tehachapi and devers colorado river transmission projects  primarily related to environmental monitoring and mitigation costs  scope changes and schedule delays 
currently  sce is completing the final engineering design for these projects and expects to file revised cost estimates with the cpuc later this year 
subject to further permitting and schedule delays  sce has revised its direct capital expenditure estimates for the tehachapi project to billion from billion and revised its estimates for the devers colorado river project to million from million 
the tehachapi project may be further impacted by issues related to aviation marking and lighting and community opposition to portions of the line  as further discussed in sce liquidity and capital resources capital investment plan 
capital program cost increases have been partially offset by expenditures for other transmission reliability projects  which were deferred due to delays from once through cooling requirements for coastal generating plants 
sce plans to utilize cash generated from its operations  tax benefits and issuance of additional debt and preferred equity to fund its capital needs 
management overview of emg emg s competitive power generation business primarily consists of the generation and sale into the pjm market of energy and capacity from merchant coal fired power plants and a portfolio of natural gas and wind projects 
emg s operating results were significantly lower in compared to due to lower realized energy and capacity prices and generation at the coal plants 
power prices fell in the fourth quarter of and have continued to fall in  driven by an abundance of low priced natural gas  weather conditions and a slow economic recovery 
moreover  the abundance of low priced natural gas has resulted in increased competition from natural gas fired generating units in the markets in which midwest generation operates  and generation from midwest generation s plants has been correspondingly affected 
also at the end of  a favorable long term rail contract that supplied midwest generation s fleet expired and was replaced by a higher priced contract 
emg expects that midwest generation s average fuel cost mwh will increase by approximately one third in furthermore  homer city is engaged in discussions with the owner lessors regarding funding of retrofit expenditures 
table of contents for the homer city plant that  if successful in providing funding  will likely result in eme s loss of substantially all beneficial economic interest in and material control of the homer city plant 
finally  as discussed below  emg recorded significant impairment charges during the fourth quarter of at december   eme had corporate cash and cash equivalents of million and million of available borrowing capacity under its million revolving credit facility maturing in june and midwest generation had cash and cash equivalents of million and million of available borrowing capacity under its million credit facility maturing in june subsequent to the end of the fiscal year  eme terminated its revolving credit facility  and there can be no assurance that midwest generation will be eligible to draw on its credit facility prior to maturity 
any replacements of these credit lines will likely be on less favorable terms and conditions  and there is no assurance that eme will  or will be able to  replace these credit lines or any portion of them 
eme had billion of unsecured notes outstanding at december   million of which mature in unless energy and capacity prices increase  emg expects that it will incur further reductions in cash flow and losses in years subsequent to as well as in  and a continuation of these adverse trends coupled with pending debt maturities and the need to retrofit its plants to comply with governmental regulations will strain emg s liquidity 
to address such scenario  emg would need to consider all options available to it  including potential sales of assets or restructurings or reorganization of the capital structure of emg and its subsidiaries 
emg s current business plans are focused on liquidity and operating effectively through the current commodity price cycle and on environmental compliance as described below 
midwest generation environmental compliance plans and costs during  midwest generation continued to advance necessary activities for nox and nox controls to meet the requirements of the cps 
midwest generation does not anticipate a material change to its current approach in order to comply with the mats rule 
midwest generation expects to continue to develop and implement a compliance program that includes the operations of aci systems  upgrades to particulate removal systems and the use of dry sorbent injection  combined with its use of low sulfur prb coal  to meet emissions limits for criteria pollutants  such as nox and nox as well as for hazardous air pollutants  such as mercury  acid gas and non mercury metals 
a significant decline in power prices from september   combined with new environmental regulations and public policy pressure on coal generation have resulted in continuing uncertainties for merchant coal fired power plants 
decisions regarding whether or not to proceed with retrofitting any particular remaining units to comply with cps requirements for so 
emissions  including those that have received permits  are subject to a number of factors  such as market conditions  regulatory and legislative developments  liquidity and forecasted commodity prices and capital and operating costs applicable at the time decisions are required or made 
midwest generation may also elect to shut down units  instead of installing controls  to be in compliance with the cps 
decisions about any particular combination of retrofits and shutdowns midwest generation may ultimately employ also remain subject to conditions applicable at the time decisions are required or made 
final decisions on whether to install controls  to install particular kinds of controls  and to actually expend capital or continue with the expenditure of capital will be made as required  subject to the requirements of the cps and other applicable regulations 
in february  midwest generation decided to shut down the fisk station by the end of and the crawford station by the end of and concluded it was less likely to retrofit the waukegan station rather than the larger powerton  joliet and will county stations 
as a result  emg recorded an impairment charge of million at december  related to the crawford  fisk and waukegan stations 
for further discussion  see edison international consolidated liquidity and capital resources critical accounting estimates and policies impairment of long lived assets application to midwest generation stations and item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note asset impairments  lease terminations and other 
units that are not retrofitted may continue to operate until required to shut down by applicable regulations or operate with reduced output 
in connection with its decision to close the fisk and crawford stations  midwest generation entered into a memorandum of understanding with the city of chicago  acting through the commissioner of health  which acknowledges that the cessation of coal fired electric generation at the fisk and crawford stations will achieve the objectives of the proposed chicago clean power ordinance without a need to pass the proposed clean power ordinance or similar ordinances recognizing that such agreement cannot bind the chicago city council or its members 
midwest generation and the city of chicago have also agreed to collaborate with key stakeholders to consider potential future uses  ownership and sources of external funding to transition the sites for such uses 
the closure of the fisk and crawford stations will be subject to review for reliability by pjm interconnection llc  the regional transmission organization that controls the area where these plants are located 
in total  midwest generation estimates to employees will be affected 
the timing and amount of severance benefits  if any  will be determined after completion of review of personnel based on seniority and other factors and  in the case of the crawford station  the amount may be affected by the timing of the plant closure 
other obligations related to the fisk and crawford stations could be affected by the plant closing  including sales of capacity  for which midwest generation is unable 
table of contents to reasonably estimate the impact  or range of impacts  that could be incurred 
midwest generation does not expect to incur future capital expenditures to close these plants 
based on work to date  midwest generation estimates the cost of retrofitting the large stations powerton  joliet units and and will county using dry scrubbing with sodium based sorbents to comply with cps requirements for so emissions  and the associated upgrading of existing particulate removal systems  would be up to approximately million 
the cost of retrofitting joliet unit is not included in the large unit amounts as it is less likely that midwest generation will make retrofits for this unit 
the estimated cost of retrofitting joliet unit  if made  would be approximately million  while the estimated cost of retrofitting the waukegan station  if made  would be approximately million

in february  midwest generation received an extension of its permit to install a dry sorbent injection system at the powerton station 
homer city lease homer city engaged a financial advisor and conducted a bidding process to obtain capital funding from third parties during the second half of to partially finance the installation of the environmental improvements 
during the fourth quarter of  such efforts failed to obtain sufficient interest from market participants necessary to fund the capital needed to make such improvements under the current lease arrangement 
homer city does not currently have sufficient capital and does not expect to generate sufficient funds from operations to complete retrofits 
emg is under no legal obligation to  and has chosen not to  provide funding 
restrictions under the agreements entered into as part of homer city s sale leaseback transaction affect  and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit  homer city s ability to incur indebtedness or make capital expenditures 
consequently  homer city s ability to install environmental compliance equipment will be dependent on funding from the owner lessors or third parties 
homer city is currently engaged in discussions with the owner lessors regarding the potential for such funding 
emg expects that the outcome of any such discussions  if successful in providing funding for the homer city plant  will likely result in emg s loss of substantially all beneficial economic interest in and material control of the homer city plant 
failure to resolve the source of funding of necessary capital expenditures for the homer city plant could result in homer city s default under the lease agreements giving rise to remedies for the owner lessors and secured lease obligation bondholders  which could include foreclosing on the leased assets  the general partner of homer city  or both 
there is no assurance that an agreement will be reached with the owner lessors or the existing secured lease obligation bondholders on funding the capital improvements 
homer city believes it is unlikely to meet the covenant requirements of its sale leaseback documents relating to the payment of equity rent at april  and will be unable to make the required equity rent payment 
there is no assurance that subsequent rent payments will be made 
under the sale leaseback documents  rent payments are comprised of two components  senior rent and equity rent 
senior rent is used exclusively for debt service to secured lease obligation bondholders  while equity rent is paid to the owner lessors 
in order to pay equity rent  among other requirements  homer city must meet historical and projected senior rent service coverage ratios of to subject to reduction to to under certain circumstances 
a failure to pay equity rent does not entitle the owner lessors to foreclose upon homer city s leasehold interest  but it does result in the suspension of homer city s ability to make permitted distributions 
moreover  homer city would be permanently restricted in its ability to make permitted distributions if a failure to pay equity rent when due was not cured within nine months  or even if cured  occurred more than one additional time during the term of the lease 
homer city is not subject to any minimum historical and projected senior rent service coverage ratios except as conditions to distributions and equity rent payments 
also  failure by homer city to pay equity rent when due in april could trigger termination of the million senior rent reserve letter of credit 
homer city would then be required to fund the senior rent reserve  and failure to do so could entitle counterparties to seek available remedies under the sale leaseback documents  including termination or foreclosure upon the leasehold interest 
as a result of the expectation that emg is likely to lose substantially all beneficial economic interest in and material control of the homer city plant  emg recorded an impairment charge of billion for the fourth quarter of for further discussion  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note asset impairments  lease terminations and other 
included in the consolidated financial statements are the assets and liabilities related to homer city 
in the event that emg no longer controls homer city  emg will record a loss on disposition of assets and liabilities and likely classify homer city as a discontinued operation 
the loss on disposition will be determined based on the assets and liabilities at the date of disposition and an assessment whether any ongoing contingencies exist

table of contents as a result of the financial outlook of homer city  as previously discussed  emg s subsidiary  emmt  has ceased to enter into hedging activities related to future power sales  but continues to enter into energy and capacity transactions on behalf of homer city pursuant to an intercompany agreement 
those transactions are generally back to back transactions in which emmt enters into a transaction with a third party as a principal and then enters into an equivalent transaction with homer city 
in the case of capacity  emmt has sold homer city capacity in the annual pjm base residual auctions through may if homer city were to default on its obligations to supply capacity  then emmt would be liable to pjm to supply that capacity  and failure to do so would expose emmt to penalties under the pjm tariffs 
if one or more of the homer city units were to be unavailable as a capacity resource and emmt did not fulfill this obligation through market transactions  then emmt would be required to refund any capacity payments received and would be assessed by pjm a penalty equal to the greater of of the capacity payments or per mw day 
emg s renewable energy activities recent developments related to emg renewable financing and development activities include on december   emg s subsidiary  eme closed a million portfolio financing of three contracted wind projects representing megawatts of generation capacity previously funded entirely with equity 
funding available in the amount of million from the term loan facility  net of transaction costs  was distributed to eme in and approximately million  net of transaction costs  of available funds is expected to be distributed in the first quarter of when the pinnacle project achieves certain completion milestones 
as part of its plan to obtain third party equity capital to finance the development of a portion of emg s wind portfolio  on february   edison mission wind sold its indirect equity interests in the cedro hill wind project mw in texas  the mountain wind power i project mw in wyoming and the mountain wind power ii project mw in wyoming to a new venture  capistrano wind partners 
outside investors provided million of the funding 
capistrano wind partners also agreed to acquire the broken bow i wind project mw in nebraska and the crofton bluffs wind project mw in nebraska for consideration expected to include million from the same outside investors upon the satisfaction of specified conditions  including commencement of commercial operation and completion of project debt financing 
the proceeds from outside investors net of costs on the projects to be completed are expected to be distributed to emg and available for general corporate purposes 
for additional information  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note variable interest entities categories of variable interest entities projects or entities that are consolidated 
during the fourth quarter of  emg significantly reduced development of renewable energy projects to conserve cash and in light of more limited market opportunities 
as a result  emg reduced staffing and has undertaken efforts to reduce funding joint development projects  thereby reducing the development pipeline of potential wind projects to a projected installed capacity to approximately  megawatts 
these changes triggered charges of million 
in addition  management has reviewed the storm lake project and four small wind projects in minnesota  and based on an expected future increase in operating costs and declines in long term power prices that the projects could potentially realize following the term of the power purchase agreements  emg has recorded an impairment charge of million

the tehachapi project costs and schedule may be further impacted by the cpuc s response to sce s petition to modify the decision approving the project for the purpose of obtaining authorization to install aviation marking and lighting in accordance with faa standards 
in october  the cpuc staff notified sce that the constructed portions of the project should be marked and lighted as required  but instructed sce to defer completion of remaining project components that may require aviation marking or lighting pending cpuc review of the petition to modify 
community opposition to portions of the project continues and requests for reconsideration of the cpuc s decision are pending 
in january  in response to a cpuc request  sce provided information on potential new options for a portion of the project  including traversing a state park  changing the nature of some of the towers  and undergrounding lines 
adoption of any of these alternatives could create additional costs and delay the completion of the project 
sce is required to file revised cost estimates with the cpuc 
as with all transmission investments  cost recovery will be subject to future rate proceedings 
distribution projects distribution expenditures include projects and programs to meet customer load growth requirements  reliability and infrastructure replacement needs  information and other technology and related facility requirements 
generation projects generation expenditures include nuclear related capital expenditures necessary to maintain safe and reliable plant operation  meet nrc and other regulatory requirements  and optimize plant performance and cost effectiveness 
hydro related capital expenditures associated with infrastructure and equipment replacement and renewal of ferc operating licenses 
infrastructure expenditures include dam improvements  flowline and substation refurbishments  and powerline replacements 
equipment replacement expenditures include transformers  automation  switchgear  hydro turbine repowers  generator rewinds  and small generator replacements 
sce s solar photovoltaic program to develop up to mw of utility owned solar photovoltaic generating facilities generally ranging in size from to mw each  on commercial and industrial rooftops and other space in sce s service territory 
the cpuc has authorized recovery of reasonable costs and allowed for a return on investment 
edisonsmartconnect sce s edisonsmartconnect project involves installing state of the art smart meters in approximately million households and small businesses through its service area 
in march  sce was authorized by the cpuc to recover billion in customer rates for the deployment phase of edisonsmartconnect 
in  sce began full deployment of meters to all residential and small business customers under kw 
sce anticipates completion of the deployment in in  the cpuc began exploring the feasibility of allowing customers to voluntarily opt out of smart meter installation 

table of contents sce has provided information to the cpuc on the costs and technical issues involved 
should the cpuc order sce to implement an opt out option  sce would file an application seeking to recover the associated costs in rates 
regulatory proceedings energy efficiency shareholder risk reward incentive mechanism the cpuc previously adopted and extended through an energy efficiency risk reward incentive mechanism energy efficiency mechanism allowing sce to earn incentives based on sce s performance toward meeting cpuc energy efficiency goals 
in december  the cpuc issued a decision approving an million final payment for performance under the energy efficiency mechanism 
the cpuc is reviewing and may further modify or eliminate the energy efficiency mechanism for performance periods subsequent to san onofre outage and repair issues four replacement steam generators were installed at san onofre units and in and inspections of the unit steam generators during a planned maintenance and refueling outage in february found some isolated areas of wear in some of the  heat transfer tubes 
in light of this condition  sce  in consultation with the steam generators manufacturer  determined that a number of the tubes should be removed from service as a preventive measure 
the steam generators are designed to include sufficient tubes to accommodate a need to remove some from service for a variety of reasons  including wear  and the tubes that sce is in the process of preventively removing from service in unit are well within the extra margin 
additionally  on january   a water leak was detected in one of the tubes of a new steam generator in unit  and the unit was safely taken offline 
extensive testing of the unit steam generators is ongoing to fully understand the cause of the leak 
in a memorandum dated february   the nrc determined that inasmuch as the leak was in a newly installed steam generator  it will conduct an event follow up baseline inspection to review san onofre s response to the leak and verify the appropriateness of its remedial actions 
each unit will be restarted when repairs on that unit are completed  and sce is satisfied that it is safe to do so 
the steam generators were supplied by mitsubishi heavy industries mhi and are warranted for an initial period of years from acceptance 
subject to certain exceptions  the purchase agreement sets forth specified damages for certain repairs  generally limits mhi s aggregate contractual liability to the approximately million purchase price of the generators and excludes consequential damages from recovery  such as the cost of replacement power 
in  the cpuc authorized expenditures of approximately million million when adjusted for inflation for sce s share of san onofre to purchase and install new generators and remove their predecessors 
those expenditures remain subject to cpuc review upon submission of sce s final costs for the overall project 
sce expects to file an application with the cpuc setting forth final project costs in the third or fourth quarter of replacement power costs are recovered through the erra balancing account  subject to reasonableness review 
dividend restrictions the cpuc regulates sce s capital structure which limits the dividends it may pay edison international 
in sce s most recent cost of capital proceeding  the cpuc set an authorized capital structure for sce which included a common equity component of 
sce may make distributions to edison international as long as the common equity component of sce s capital structure remains at or above the authorized level on a month weighted average basis 
at december   sce s month weighted average common equity component of total capitalization was resulting in the capacity to pay million in additional dividends 
during  sce made million in dividend payments to its parent  edison international 
future dividend amounts and timing of distributions are dependent upon several factors including the level of capital expenditures  operating cash flows and earnings 
margin and collateral deposits certain derivative instruments  power procurement contracts and other contractual arrangements contain collateral requirements 
future collateral requirements may differ from the requirements at december   due to the addition of incremental power and energy procurement contracts with collateral requirements  if any  and the impact of changes in wholesale power and natural gas prices on sce s contractual obligations 
some of the power procurement contracts contain provisions that require sce to maintain an investment grade credit rating from the major credit rating agencies 
if sce s credit rating were to fall below investment grade  sce may be required to pay the liability or post additional collateral 

table of contents the table below provides the amount of collateral posted by sce to its counterparties as well as the potential collateral that would be required as of december  in millions collateral posted as of december  incremental collateral requirements for power procurement contracts resulting from a potential downgrade of sce s credit rating to below investment grade posted and potential collateral requirements collateral provided to counterparties and other brokers consisted of million of cash which was offset against net derivative liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  million of cash reflected in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and million in letters of credit 
there would be no increase to sce s total posted and potential collateral requirements based on sce s forward positions as of december  due to adverse market price movements over the remaining lives of the existing power procurement contracts using a confidence level 
workers compensation self insurance fund sce is self insured for workers compensation claims 
sce assesses workers compensation claims that have been asserted and those that have been incurred but not reported to determine the probable amount of losses that should be recorded 
the department of industrial relations for the state of california requires companies that are self insured for workers compensation to post collateral in the form of cash and or letters of credits based on the estimated workers compensation liability if a company s bond rating were to fall below b 
as of december   if sce s bond rating were to fall below a b rating  sce would be required to post million for its workers compensation self insurance plan 
regulatory balancing accounts sce s cash flows are affected by regulatory balancing account over or under collections 
over and under collections represent differences between cash collected in current rates for specified forecasted costs and the costs actually incurred 
with some exceptions  sce seeks to adjust rates on an annual basis or at other designated times to recover or refund the balances recorded in its balancing account 
under or over collections in these balancing accounts impact cash flows and can change rapidly 
over and under collections accrue interest based on a three month commercial paper rate published by the federal reserve 
as of december   balancing account net over collections were billion primarily related to public purpose related program costs as well as fuel and power procurement related costs 
over collections for public purpose related programs are expected to decrease as costs are incurred to fund programs established by the cpuc 
the fuel and power procurement related over collections of million are expected to be refunded through a rate adjustment in historical segment cash flows the table below sets forth condensed historical cash flow information for sce in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided used by financing activities net cash used by investing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased million in compared to the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to the following million decrease from refunding to customers overcollections of revenue which resulted from actual electricity sales exceeding forecasted electricity sales 
sce began refunding this balance through a rate adjustment effective june   million decrease resulting from higher balancing account overcollections for fuel and power procurement related 
table of contents costs in when compared to overcollections of approximately million in compared to approximately million in 
the overcollection was primarily due to lower realized gas and power prices compared to the amounts forecasted for setting customer rates 
sce began refunding the overcollection through a rate adjustment beginning on june  the balancing account was over collected by million at december   million at december   million at december  and under collected by million at december   and million increase resulting from higher income before depreciation and income taxes primarily driven by higher customer revenue 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million in  compared to the cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily due to the following million decrease in cash reflecting lower net tax receipts in compared to primarily related to the impacts of the global settlement 
in  sce received tax allocation payments of million from the global settlement  compared to tax allocation payments received of million in this decrease was partially offset by higher estimated tax payments in compared to million net cash inflow from balancing accounts composed of million net cash inflow from the funding of public purpose and solar initiative programs and lower pension and pbop contributions in compared to  and million net cash outflow due to the decrease in balancing account cash flows for fuel and power procurement related costs collections of approximately million in  compared to collections of approximately million in

the estimated contributions for sce are not available beyond these amounts represent estimates that are based on assumptions that are subject to change 
in addition  funding of future contributions could be impacted by the final grc decision 
see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note compensation and benefit plans for further information 
at december   sce had a total net liability recorded for uncertain tax positions of million  which is excluded from the table 
sce cannot make reliable estimates of the cash flows by period due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of resolving these open tax issues with the irs 
the contractual obligations table does not include derivative obligations and asset retirement obligations  which are discussed in item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note derivative instruments and hedging activities  and item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note property  plant and equipment  respectively 
contingencies sce has contingencies related to the cpsd investigations  four corners new source review litigation  nuclear insurance  wildfire insurance and spent nuclear fuel  which are discussed in item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note commitments and contingencies 
environmental remediation sce records its environmental remediation liabilities when site assessments and or remedial actions are probable and a range of reasonably likely cleanup costs can be estimated 
sce reviews its sites and measures the liability quarterly  by assessing a range of reasonably likely costs for each identified site using currently available information  including existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations  experience gained at similar sites  and the probable level of involvement and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties 
these estimates include costs for site investigations  remediation  operations and maintenance  monitoring and site closure 
unless there is a probable amount  sce records the lower end of this reasonably likely range of costs classified as other long term liabilities at undiscounted amounts as timing of cash flows is uncertain 
as of december   sce had identified material sites for remediation and recorded an estimated minimum liability of million 
sce expects to recover of its remediation costs at certain sites 
see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note commitments and contingencies for further discussion 
market risk exposures sce s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates  commodity prices and volumes  and counterparty credit 
fluctuations in interest rates can affect earnings and cash flows 
fluctuations in commodity prices and volumes and counterparty credit losses may temporarily affect cash flows  but are not expected to affect earnings due to expected recovery through regulatory mechanisms 
derivative instruments are used  as appropriate  to manage market risks for customers and sce 
for a further discussion of sce s market risk exposures  including commodity price risk  credit risk and interest rate risk  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note derivative instruments and hedging activities and note fair value measurements 
interest rate risk sce is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its financing and short term investing activities used for liquidity purposes  to fund business operations and to fund capital investments 
the nature and amount of sce s long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
changes in interest rates may impact sce s authorized rate of return for the period beyond  see item business overview of ratemaking process cpuc for further discussion 

table of contents at december   the fair market value of sce s long term debt including current portion of long term debt was billion  compared to a carrying value of billion 
a increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a million decrease in the fair market value of sce s long term debt 
a decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a million increase in the fair market value of sce s long term debt 
commodity price risk sce and its customers are exposed to the risk of a change in the market price of natural gas and electric power 
sce s hedging program reduces exposure to variability in market prices related to sce s purchases and sales of electric power and natural gas 
sce expects recovery of its related hedging costs through the erra balancing account or cpuc approved procurement plans  and as a result  exposure to commodity price is not expected to impact earnings  but may impact the timing of cash flows 
sce s hedging program reduces customer exposure to variability in market prices 
as part of this program  sce enters into energy options  swaps  forward arrangements  tolling arrangements  and congestion revenue rights crrs 
the transactions are pre approved by the cpuc or executed in compliance with cpuc approved procurement plans 
for further discussion on derivative instruments entered into to mitigate commodity price exposures  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fair value of derivative instruments with some exceptions  sce records derivative instruments on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are expected to be recovered from or refunded to customers through regulatory mechanisms and  therefore  sce s fair value changes have no impact on earnings 
sce does not use hedge accounting for these transactions due to this regulatory accounting treatment 
for further discussion on fair value measurements and the fair value hierarchy  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note fair value measurements 
the fair value of outstanding derivative instruments used at sce to mitigate its exposure to commodity price risk was a net liability of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the net liability was related to changes in unrealized losses on economic hedging activities primarily due to declining power and natural gas prices 
the following table summarizes the increase or decrease to the fair values of outstanding derivative instruments as of december   if the electricity prices or gas prices were changed while leaving all other assumptions constant in millions december  increase in electricity prices by decrease in electricity prices by increase in gas prices by decrease in gas prices by credit risk for information related to credit risks and how sce manages credit risk  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note derivative instruments and hedging activities 
credit risk exposure from counterparties for power and gas trading activities is measured as the sum of net accounts receivable accounts receivable less accounts payable and the current fair value of net derivative assets derivative assets less derivative liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets 
sce enters into master agreements which typically provide for a right of setoff 
accordingly  sce s credit risk exposure from counterparties is based on a net exposure under these arrangements 
sce manages the credit risk on the portfolio for both rated and non rated counterparties based on credit ratings using published ratings of counterparties and other publicly disclosed information  such as financial statements  regulatory filings  and press releases  to guide it in the process of setting credit levels  risk limits and contractual arrangements  including master netting agreements 

table of contents as of december   the amount of balance sheet exposure as described above broken down by the credit ratings of sce s counterparties  was as follows december  in millions exposure collateral net exposure s p credit rating a or higher not rated total sce assigns a credit rating based on the lower of a counterparty s s p or moody s rating 
for ease of reference  the above table uses the s p classifications to summarize risk  but reflects the lower of the two credit ratings 
exposure excludes amounts related to contracts classified as normal purchases and sales and non derivative contractual commitments that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets  except for any related net accounts receivable 
the exposure in this category relates to long term power purchase agreements 
sce s exposure is mitigated by regulatory treatment

the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to higher capitalized interest and lower debt balances under eme s and midwest generation s credit facilities  partially offset by higher wind project financing 
capitalized interest was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease was due to completion of the renewable energy projects under construction in and the increase was the result of increased interest capitalization for renewable energy projects under construction

homer city would be permanently restricted in its ability to make distributions if a failure to pay equity rent when due was not cured within nine months  or even if cured  occurred more than one additional time during the term of the lease 
eme has not guaranteed homer city s obligations under the leases 
homer city believes it is unlikely to meet the covenant requirements of its sale leaseback agreements relating to the payment of equity rent at april   and will be unable to make the required equity rent payment

these market risks arise from price fluctuations of electricity  capacity  fuel  emission allowances  and transmission rights 
additionally  emg s financial results can be affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
emg manages these risks in part by using derivative instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
derivative instruments emg uses derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to market risks that arise from price fluctuations of electricity  capacity  fuel  emission allowances  and transmission rights

energy from mw of merchant renewable energy projects is sold in the energy markets  primarily at spot prices in pjm and ercot 

table of contents the following table depicts the average historical market prices for energy per megawatt hour at the locations indicated hour average historical market prices midwest generation plants northern illinois hub homer city plant pjm west hub homer city busbar energy prices were calculated at the northern illinois hub and homer city busbar delivery points and the pjm west hub using historical hourly day ahead prices as published by pjm or provided on the pjm web site 
the following table sets forth the forward market prices for energy per megawatt hour as quoted for sales into the northern illinois hub and pjm west hub at december  hour forward energy prices northern illinois hub pjm west hub calendar strip calendar strip energy prices were determined by obtaining broker quotes and information from other public sources relating to the northern illinois hub and pjm west hub delivery points 
market price for energy purchases for the entire calendar year 
power prices at the northern illinois hub fell in the fourth quarter of and continued to fall in due to an abundance of low priced natural gas and the sales volume from the midwest generation plants has been correspondingly affected 
forward market prices at the northern illinois hub and pjm west hub fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including natural gas prices  transmission congestion  changes in market rules  electricity demand which in turn is affected by weather  economic growth  and other factors  plant outages in the region  and the amount of existing and planned power plant capacity 
the actual spot prices for electricity delivered by the coal plants into these markets may vary materially from the forward market prices set forth in the preceding table

the rpm auction capacity prices for the delivery period of june  to may  and june  to may  varied between different areas of pjm 
in the western portion of pjm  affecting midwest generation  the prices of per mw day and per mw day were substantially lower than other areas capacity prices 
the impact of lower capacity prices for these periods compared to previous years will have an adverse effect on midwest generation s revenues unless such lower capacity prices are offset by an unavailability of competing resources and increased energy prices 
revenues from the sale of capacity from midwest generation and homer city beyond the periods set forth above will depend upon the amount of capacity available and future market prices either in pjm or nearby markets if eme has an opportunity to capture a higher value associated with those markets

basis risk sales made from the coal plants in the real time or day ahead market receive the actual real time or day ahead prices  as the case may be  at the busbars delivery points of the individual plants 
in order to mitigate price risk from changes in forward spot prices at the individual plant busbars  emg may enter into cash settled futures contracts as well as forward contracts with counterparties for energy to be delivered in future periods 
currently  a liquid market for entering into these contracts at the individual plant busbars does not exist 
a liquid market does exist for a settlement point at the pjm west hub in the case of the homer city plant and for settlement points at the northern illinois hub and the aep dayton and indiana hubs in the case of the midwest generation plants 
emg s hedging activities use these settlement points and  to a lesser extent  other 
table of contents similar trading hubs to enter into hedging contracts 
to the extent that  on the settlement date of a hedge contract  spot prices at the relevant busbar are lower than spot prices at the settlement point  the proceeds actually realized from the related hedge contract are effectively reduced by the difference 
this is referred to as basis risk 
during  day ahead prices at the homer city busbar were lower than those at the pjm west hub by an average of  compared to during and during  due to transmission congestion in pjm 
during  day ahead prices at the individual busbars of the midwest generation plants were lower than the aep dayton hub  cinergy hub and northern illinois hub by an average of  and less than  respectively  compared to  and less than  respectively  during  due to transmission congestion in pjm

midwest generation contracts with rail carriers to transport coal to its facilities 
in anticipation of the expiration on december  of its existing rail transportation contracts  during the fourth quarter of  midwest generation entered into new multi year transportation contracts with union pacific railroad and two short haul carriers for a specified minimum and maximum amount of tons effective january  the estimated minimum annual costs of transportation of coal under these contracts  based on tonnage commitments  are million during  million in  and million in however  all of the contracts have provisions that address the financial exposure of midwest generation related to a plant closure under certain circumstances as specified in the agreements 
the contracts provide for quarterly and annual cost adjustments based on a number of factors that may increase the minimum payments 
emg believes midwest generation is fully contracted in based on its anticipated coal requirements for midwest generation 
based on homer city s anticipated coal requirements in excess of the amount under contract  homer city expects that a change in the price of coal at december  would increase or decrease pre tax income by approximately million

critical accounting estimates and policies the accounting policies described below are considered critical to obtaining an understanding of edison international s consolidated financial statements because their application requires the use of significant estimates and judgments by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
management estimates and judgments are inherently uncertain and may differ significantly from actual results achieved 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires significant assumptions and changes in the estimate or  the use of alternative estimates  that could have a material impact on edison international s results of operations or financial position 
for more information on edison international s accounting policies  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies 
rate regulated enterprises nature of estimate required 
sce follows the accounting principles for rate regulated enterprises which are required for entities whose rates are set by regulators at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service  plus a return on net investment  or rate base 
regulators may also impose certain penalties or grant certain incentives 
due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenue  these principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a unregulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates  conversely the principles allow creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred 
key assumptions and approach used 
sce s management assesses at the end of each reporting period whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as the current regulatory environment  the issuance of rate orders on recovery of the specific or a similar incurred cost to sce or other rate regulated entities in california  and other factors that would indicate that the regulator will treat an incurred cost as allowable for ratemaking purposes 
using these factors  management has determined that existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or settlement 
this determination reflects the current regulatory climate in california and is subject to change in the future 
effect if different assumption used 
significant management judgment is required to evaluate the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets  the recognition of incentives and revenue subject to refund  as well as the anticipated cost of regulatory liabilities or penalties 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  all or part of the regulatory assets and liabilities would have to be written off against current period earnings 
at december   the consolidated balance sheets included regulatory assets of billion and regulatory liabilities of billion 
if different judgments were reached on recovery of costs and timing of income recognition  sce s earnings may vary from the amounts reported 
impairment of long lived assets nature of estimates required 
long lived assets  including intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance 
authoritative guidance requires that if the undiscounted expected future cash flow from a company s assets or group of assets without interest charges is less than its carrying value  asset impairment must be recognized on the financial statements 
the impairment charges  if applicable  are calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value  which represents the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the asset or  in the case of assets expected to be sold  at fair value less costs to sell 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators exist or when there is a commitment to sell or dispose of the asset 
these evaluations may result from significant decreases in the market price of an asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  as well as economic or operational analyses 
key assumptions and approach used 
the assessment of impairment requires significant management judgment to determine if an indicator of impairment has occurred  how assets should be grouped  the forecast of undiscounted expected future cash flow over the asset s estimated useful life to determine if an impairment exists  and if an impairment 
table of contents exists  the fair value of the asset or asset group 
factors that are considered important  which could trigger an impairment  include operating losses from a project  projected future operating losses  the financial condition of counterparties  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
the determination of fair value requires management to apply judgment in estimating future prices of energy and capacity in wholesale energy markets and fuel prices that are susceptible to significant change  environmental and maintenance expenditures  and the time period due to the length of the estimated remaining useful lives 
in preparing long term cash forecasts  emg includes assumptions about future prices for electricity  capacity  fuel and related products and services  as applicable  future operations and maintenance costs and future capital expenditure requirements under different scenarios 
as appropriate  eme uses a probability weighted approach when determining whether impairment indicators exist 
assumptions included in the long term cash flow forecasts for merchant projects include observable market prices for electricity  fuel and related products and services to the extent available and long term prices developed based on a fundamental price model  long term capacity prices based on the assumption that capacity markets would continue consistent with their current structure  with expected increases in revenues as a result of declines in reserve margins beyond the price of the latest auctions  trends for additions and retirements for generation resources  and plans for compliance with both existing and possible future environmental regulations 
emg includes allocated acquired emission allowances as part of each power plant asset group 
in the case of the powerton and joliet stations and homer city  emg also includes prepaid rent in the respective asset group 
emg s unit of account is at the plant level and  accordingly  the closure of a unit at a multi unit site would not result in an impairment of property  plant and equipment unless such condition were to affect an impairment assessment on the entire plant 
effect if different assumptions used 
the estimates and assumptions used to determine whether an impairment exists are subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
the estimated fair value of an asset would change materially if different estimates and assumptions were used to determine the amounts or timing of future revenues  environmental compliance costs or operating expenditures 
application to emg s homer city plant as described in management overview of emg  homer city failed to obtain sufficient interest from market participants to fund the capital improvements during the process undertaken in the fourth quarter of  and homer city is currently engaged in discussions with the owner lessors regarding the potential for such funding 
emg expects that the outcome of any such discussions  if successful in providing funding for the homer city plant  will likely result in emg s loss of substantially all beneficial economic interest in and material control of the homer city plant 
failure to resolve the source of funding of necessary capital expenditures for the homer city plant could result in homer city s default under the lease agreements giving rise to remedies for the owner lessors and secured lease obligation bondholders  which could include foreclosing on the leased assets  the general partner of homer city  or both 
in connection with the preparation of its year end financial statements  emg concluded that these events combined with the current and projected financial condition of homer city were indicators of impairment 
the long lived asset group subject to the impairment evaluation was determined to include the homer city lease  leasehold improvements and prepaid rent 
in assessing impairment  emg concluded that the future undiscounted cash flows through the period in which emg expects to continue to have significant economic interest and control of the homer city plant were insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset group 
to measure the amount of impairment loss  the market and income approaches were considered the most appropriate and resulted in a zero fair value 
emg viewed the lack of interest from market participants to provide sufficient funding for the capital improvements as indicative that the fair value of the asset group is zero 
furthermore  discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future energy  capacity and coal prices  operations and maintenance costs and operating lease payments along with the estimated costs of constructing the environmental control equipment also indicated a fair value of zero 
accordingly  emg recorded an impairment charge of billion for the fourth quarter of application to emg s midwest generation stations a significant decline in power prices from september   combined with new environmental regulations and public policy pressure on coal generation have resulted in continuing uncertainties for merchant coal fired power plants 
in connection with the preparation of its year end financial statements  emg concluded  based on the current energy price environment  it is less likely that midwest generation will install environmental controls required by the cps at its fisk  
table of contents crawford and waukegan stations  and such assessment was an indicator that these stations were impaired 
management updated the probability weighted future undiscounted cash flows expected to be received at these stations and concluded that such amounts did not recover the respective station s carrying amounts 
as part of these alternative cash flow scenarios  management considered a shortened estimated useful life of each station if environmental improvements were not made and a forecasted reduction in generation from lower forward power prices 
in february  midwest generation decided to shut down the fisk station by the end of and the crawford station by the end of to measure the amount of the impairment loss  the income approach was considered the most relevant  but market data obtained prior to the significant decline in power prices was used to corroborate the income approach 
the discounted cash flow analysis assumptions that have the most significant impact on fair value are forecasted energy and capacity prices 
the discounted cash flow analysis indicated a fair value of zero 
emg also concluded it was unlikely that a third party would consummate the purchase of the fisk  crawford or waukegan stations in the current economic and regulatory environment resulting in a determination that the fair value of each of these stations is zero 
this resulted in an impairment charge of million  million and million for fisk  crawford and waukegan stations  respectively 
environmental and other remediation or ongoing maintenance costs are expected to be offset by the salvage value of the asset groups 
the following table summarizes the net book value of the merchant coal fired asset groups at december  in millions joliet station powerton station will county station application to selected emg wind projects in connection with the preparation of its year end financial statements  management has reviewed the storm lake project and four small wind projects in minnesota for impairment in the fourth quarter of based on an expected future increase in operating costs and declines in long term power prices that the projects could potentially realize following the term of the power purchase agreements 
the probability weighted future undiscounted cash flows of each project are not expected to be sufficient to recover the respective carrying value of each of these long lived assets million in aggregate 
the income approach was utilized to determine fair value for these asset groups 
the most significant assumptions used in determining fair value were discount rates  future wind generation  the future availability of the project to generate energy and future plant operations expense 
the asset groups at each project consisted of property  plant and equipment and  where appropriate  deferred revenue 
in aggregate  the fair value of these five asset groups was determined to be million  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
emg s merchant wind projects in light of the decline in forecasted power prices since september   emg reviewed the long term cash forecasts for the merchant wind projects in a manner consistent with the key assumptions and approach used described above 
the expected future undiscounted cash flows of these projects recovered the carrying amount of these asset groups and  accordingly  no impairments were recorded 
the expected future cash flows for these merchant wind projects are dependent upon a number of assumptions  the most significant of which are expected future power prices and operating costs 
a decline in the forecasted cash flows in future periods could result in impairment  requiring a write down of the carrying amount to fair value 
the carrying values of the goat wind  big sky and lookout asset groups at december  were million  million and million  respectively 
derivatives nature of estimates required 
as described in item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note derivative instruments and hedging activities  sce and emg use derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in electricity and fuel prices and interest rates 
derivative instruments are recorded at fair value unless certain exceptions are met in which case the derivative is recorded on an accrual basis 
sce records derivative instruments that do not meet the normal purchases and sales exception at fair value with an offsetting regulatory asset or liability due to application of principles for rate regulated enterprises 
as a result  changes in fair value of sce derivative instruments have no impact on earnings  but may temporarily affect cash flows 
sce has not elected to use hedge accounting for these transactions due to the regulatory accounting treatment 
emg records derivative instruments that do not meet the normal purchases and sales exception at fair value  with changes in 
table of contents the derivative s fair value recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment  the effective portion of the changes in the derivative s fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
emg records derivative instruments used for trading at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income 
management s judgment is required to determine if a transaction meets the definition of a derivative and  if it does  whether the normal purchases and sales exception applies or whether individual transactions qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
management s judgment is also required to determine the fair value of derivative transactions 
key assumptions and approach used 
sce and emg determine the fair value of derivative instruments based on forward market prices in active markets adjusted for nonperformance risk 
if quoted market prices are not available  internally developed models are used to determine the fair value 
when actual market prices  or relevant observable inputs are not available  it is appropriate to use unobservable inputs which reflect management assumptions  including extrapolating limited short term observable data and developing correlations between liquid and non liquid trading hubs 
in assessing nonperformance risks  sce and emg review credit ratings of counterparties and related default rates based on such credit ratings and prices of credit default swaps 
the market price or premium for credit default swaps represents the price that a counterparty would pay to transfer the risk of default  typically bankruptcy  to another party 
a credit default swap is not directly comparable to the credit risks of derivative contracts  but provides market information of the related risk of nonperformance 
in addition  a fair value hierarchy is established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
for further information  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note fair value measurements 
effect if different assumptions used 
as described above  fair value is determined using a combination of market information or observable data and unobservable inputs which reflect management s assumptions 
changes in observable data would impact results 
in addition  unobservable inputs could have an impact on results 
fair value for level derivatives is derived using observable and unobservable inputs 
as of december   the net fair value of emg s level derivatives was an asset of million 
while it is difficult to determine the impact of a change in any one input  if the fair value of emg s level derivatives were increased or decreased by  the impact would be a million increase or decrease to operating revenues 
for emg s derivative instruments that are measured at fair value using quantitative pricing models  a significant change in estimate could affect emg s results of operations 
as of december   the net fair value of sce s level derivatives was a liability of million 
sce recovers its hedging related costs through the energy resource recovery account erra balancing account  and as a result  exposure to commodity price risk is not expected to impact earnings  but may impact cash flows

for further information on derivative instruments  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note derivative instruments and hedging activities 
nuclear decommissioning aro nature of estimate required 
regulations by the nrc require sce to decommission its nuclear power plants which is expected to begin after the plants operating licenses expire 
in accordance with authoritative guidance  sce is required to record an obligation to decommission its nuclear facilities 
nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in utility rates through contributions that are reviewed every three years by the cpuc 
due to regulatory accounting treatment  nuclear decommissioning activities are not expected to affect sce earnings 
key assumptions and approach used 
the liability to decommission sce s nuclear power facilities is based on site specific studies performed in and for san onofre and palo verde  respectively  which estimate that sce will spend approximately billion through to decommission its active nuclear facilities 
decommissioning cost estimates are updated in each nuclear decommissioning triennial proceeding 
the current estimate is based on the following assumptions from the and site specific studies decommissioning costs 
the estimated costs for labor  dismantling and disposal costs  energy and miscellaneous costs 
escalation rates 
annual escalation rates are used to convert the decommissioning cost estimates in base year dollars to decommissioning cost estimates in future year dollars 
escalation rates are primarily used for labor  material  equipment  and low level radioactive waste burial costs 
sce s current estimate is based on sce s decommissioning cost methodology used for ratemaking purposes  escalated at rates ranging from to depending on the cost element annually 

table of contents timing 
cost estimates are based on an assumption that decommissioning will commence promptly after the nrc operating licenses expire 
the operating licenses currently expire in for san onofre units and when the site specific study was completed  the licenses for the palo verde units were set to expire in  and effective april  the licenses were extended to  and for the palo verde units 
spent fuel dry storage costs 
cost estimates are based on an assumption that the doe will begin to take spent fuel in  and will remove the last spent fuel from the san onofre and palo verde sites by and  respectively 
costs for spent fuel monitoring are included until and  respectively 
changes in decommissioning technology  regulation  and economics 
the current cost studies assume the use of current technologies under current regulations and at current cost levels 
effect if different assumptions used 
the aro for decommissioning sce s active nuclear facilities was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
changes in the estimated costs or timing of decommissioning  or in the assumptions and judgments by management underlying these estimates  could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission these facilities which could have a material effect on the recorded liability and related regulatory asset 
the following table illustrates the increase to the aro and regulatory asset if the escalation rate was adjusted while leaving all other assumptions constant in millions increase to aro and regulatory asset at december  uniform increase in escalation rate of basis points pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions nature of estimate required 
authoritative accounting guidance requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet  the assets and or liabilities are normally offset through other comprehensive income loss 
in accordance with authoritative guidance for rate regulated enterprises  regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded instead of charges and credits to other comprehensive income loss for its postretirement benefit plans that are recoverable in utility rates 
edison international has a fiscal year end measurement date for all of its postretirement plans 
key assumptions of approach used 
pension and other postretirement obligations and the related effects on results of operations are calculated using actuarial models 
two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected return on assets  are important elements of plan expense and liability measurement 
additionally  health care cost trend rates are critical assumptions for postretirement health care plans 
these critical assumptions are evaluated at least annually 
other assumptions  which require management judgment  such as retirement  mortality and turnover  are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect actual experience 
as of december   edison international s pension plans had a billion benefit obligation and total expense for these plans was million for as of december   edison international s pbop plans had a billion benefit obligation and total expense for these plans was million for annual contributions made to most of sce s pension plans are currently recovered through cpuc approved regulatory mechanisms and are expected to be  at a minimum  equal to the related annual expense 

table of contents the following are critical assumptions used to determine expense for pension and other postretirement benefit for in millions pension plans postretirement benefits other than pensions discount rate expected long term return on plan assets assumed health care cost trend rates the discount rate enables edison international to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
edison international selects its discount rate by performing a yield curve analysis 
this analysis determines the equivalent discount rate on projected cash flows  matching the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
two corporate yield curves were considered  citigroup and aon hewitt 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  current and expected asset allocations are considered  as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets 
a portion of pbop trusts asset returns are subject to taxation  so the rate of return on plan assets above is determined on an after tax basis 
actual time weighted  annualized returns on the pension plan assets were  and for the one year  five year and ten year periods ended december   respectively 
actual time weighted  annualized returns on the pbop plan assets were   and over these same periods 
accounting principles provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees 
the health care cost trend rate gradually declines to for and beyond 
pension expense is recorded for sce based on the amount funded to the trusts  as calculated using an actuarial method required for ratemaking purposes  in which the impact of market volatility on plan assets is recognized in earnings on a more gradual basis 
any difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with ratemaking methods and pension expense calculated in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance for pension is accumulated as a regulatory asset or liability  and will  over time  be recovered from or returned to customers 
as of december   this cumulative difference amounted to a regulatory asset of million  meaning that the accounting method has recognized more in expense than the ratemaking method since implementation of authoritative guidance for employers accounting for pensions in as of december   edison international had unrecognized pension costs of billion and unrecognized pbop costs of million which primarily consisted of the cumulative impact of the reduced discount rates on the respective benefit obligations and the cumulative difference between the expected and actual rate of return on plan assets 
of these deferred costs  million of pension costs and million of pbop costs are recorded as regulatory assets  an offset to the underfunded liabilities of these plans  and will be amortized to expense over the average expected future service of employees 
edison international s pension and pbop plans are subject to limits established for federal tax deductibility 
sce funds its pension and pbop plans in accordance with amounts allowed by the cpuc 
executive pension plans and competitive power generation pbop plans have no plan assets 
effect if different assumptions used 
changes in the estimated costs or timing of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  or the assumptions and judgments used by management underlying these estimates  could have a material effect on the recorded expenses and liabilities 
earnings could be impacted if the cpuc eliminates or modifies the current approved sce regulatory recovery mechanism 
the following table summarizes the increase or decrease to the projected benefit obligation for pension and the accumulated benefit obligation for pbop if the discount rate were changed while leaving all other assumptions constant in millions increase in discount rate by decrease in discount rate by change to projected benefit obligation for pension change to accumulated benefit obligation for pbop

as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  edison international is required to estimate its income taxes for each jurisdiction in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current period tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within edison international s consolidated balance sheets 
edison international takes certain tax positions it believes are applied in accordance with the applicable tax laws 
however  these tax positions are subject to interpretation by the irs  state tax authorities and the courts 
edison international determines its uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
key assumptions and approach used 
accounting for tax obligations requires management judgment 
management uses judgment in determining whether the evidence indicates it is more likely than not  based solely on the technical merits  that a tax position will be sustained  and to determine the amount of tax benefits to be recognized 
judgment is also used in determining the likelihood a tax position will be settled and possible settlement outcomes 
in assessing its uncertain tax positions edison international considers  among others  the following factors the facts and circumstances of the position  regulations  rulings  and case law  opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers  and the experience gained from similar tax positions 
management evaluates uncertain tax positions at the end of each reporting period and makes adjustments when warranted based on changes in fact or law 
effect if different assumptions used 
actual income taxes may differ from the estimated amounts which could have a significant impact on the liabilities  revenue and expenses recorded in the financial statements 
edison international continues to be under audit or subject to audit for multiple years in various jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of particular tax positions that involve interpretations of complex tax laws 
a tax liability has been recorded with respect to tax positions in which the outcome is uncertain and the effect is estimable 
such liabilities are based on judgment and a final determination could take many years from the time the liability is recorded 
furthermore  settlement of tax positions included in open tax years may be resolved by compromises of tax positions based on current factors and business considerations that may result in material adjustments to income taxes previously estimated 
see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note income taxes for a further discussion on income taxes 
accounting for contingencies  guarantees and indemnities nature of estimates required 
edison international records loss contingencies when it determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when a guarantee or indemnification subject to authoritative guidance is entered into  edison international records a liability for the estimated fair value of the underlying guarantee or indemnification 
gain contingencies are recognized in the financial statements when they are realized 
key assumptions and approach used 
the determination of a reserve for a loss contingency is based on management judgment and estimates with respect to the likely outcome of the matter  including the analysis of different scenarios 
liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change 
in assessing whether a loss is a reasonable possibility  edison international may consider the following factors  among others the nature of the litigation  claim or assessment  available information  opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors  and the experience gained from similar cases 
edison international provides disclosures for material contingencies when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred 
some guarantees and indemnifications could have a 
table of contents significant financial impact under certain circumstances  and management also considers the probability of such circumstances occurring when estimating the fair value 
effect if different assumptions used 
actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities  revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  for guarantees and indemnities actual results may differ from the amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on edison international s consolidated financial statements
