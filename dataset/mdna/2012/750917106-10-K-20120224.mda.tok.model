business overview we are a premier intellectual property and technology licensing company focusing on the creation  design  development and licensing of patented innovations  technologies and architectures that are foundational to nearly all digital electronics products and systems 
our mission is to continuously enrich the end user experience of electronic systems through groundbreaking innovations and technologies designed to improve the performance  power efficiency  time to market and cost effectiveness of the products  components and systems offered by market leading companies in semiconductors  computing  tablets  handheld devices  mobile applications  gaming and graphics  high definition televisions and displays  general lighting  cryptography and data security 
our inventors and engineering teams focus on creating innovations designed to address the most challenging demands of each target market and industry 
we believe we have established an unparalleled licensing platform and business model that will continue to foster the development of new foundational technologies 
by continuing to build upon this platform  our goal is to create additional licensing opportunities  and thereby perpetuate strong company operating performance and long term stockholder value 
while we have historically focused our efforts in the development of technologies for electronics memory and chip interfaces  we have been expanding our portfolio of inventions and solutions to address additional markets in lighting  displays  chip and system security  digital media  as well as new areas within the semiconductor industry  such as imaging and non volatile memory 
we intend to continue our growth into new technology fields  consistent with our mission to create great value through our innovations and to make those technologies available through our licensing business model 
key to our efforts  both in our current businesses and in any new area of diversification  will be hiring and retaining world class inventors  scientists and engineers to lead the development of inventions and technology solutions for these fields of focus  and the management and business support personnel necessary to execute our plans and strategies 
prior to  we operated in a single industry segment  the design  development and licensing of memory and logic interfaces  lighting and optoelectronics  and other technologies 
in  we reorganized  and as a result  currently have two business groups sbg which focuses on the design  development and licensing of technology that is semiconductor based  and nbg which focuses on the design  development and licensing of technologies for lighting  displays  chip and system security  anti counterfeiting  digital media and other markets 
as of december   only sbg was 
table of contents considered a reportable segment as it met the quantitative thresholds for disclosure as a reportable segment 
as such  segment information is not separately discussed below 
for additional information concerning segment reporting  see note  business segments and major customers  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
the key elements of our strategy are as follows innovate develop and patent our innovative technology to provide fundamental competitive advantage when incorporated into semiconductors  and digital electronics products and systems 
drive adoption communicate the advantages of our patented innovations and technologies to the industry and encourage its adoption through demonstrations and incorporation in the products of select customers 
monetize license our patented inventions and technology solutions to customers for use in their semiconductor and system products 
as of december   our semiconductor  lighting  display  security and other technologies are covered by  us and foreign patents 
additionally  we have  patent applications pending 
some of the patents and pending patent applications are derived from a common parent patent application or are foreign counterpart patent applications 
we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate and would further our overall business strategy and objectives 
in some instances  obtaining appropriate levels of protection may involve prosecuting continuation and counterpart patent applications based on a common parent application 
we believe that our patented innovations provide our customers means to achieve improved performance  lower risk  greater cost effectiveness and other benefits in their products and services 
our patented inventions and technology solutions are offered to our customers through either a patent license or a solutions license 
our revenues are primarily derived from patent licenses  through which we provide our customers a license to use some specified portion of our broad portfolio of patented inventions 
the patent license essentially provides our customers with a defined right to use our patented innovations in the customer s own digital electronics products  systems or services  as applicable 
the patent licenses may also define the specific field of use where our customers may use or employ our inventions in their products 
patent license agreements are structured with fixed  variable or a hybrid of fixed and variable royalty payments over certain defined periods 
we also offer our customers solutions licenses to support the implementation and adoption of our technology in their products or services 
our solutions license offerings include a range of solutions developed by rambus  which include leadership solutions which are rambus proprietary solutions widely licensed to our customers and industry standard solutions that we provide to our customers under license for incorporation into our customers digital electronics products and systems 
we offer a range of services as part of our solutions licenses which can include know how and technology transfer  product design and development  system integration  supply chain consulting and other services 
these solutions license agreements may have both a fixed price non recurring component and ongoing royalties 
further  under solutions licenses  our customers typically receive licenses to our patents necessary to implement these solutions in their products with specific rights and restrictions to the applicable patents elaborated in their individual contracts with us 
royalties represent a substantial majority of our total revenue 
we derive the majority of our royalty revenue by licensing our broad portfolio of patents for chip interfaces to our customers 
these licenses may cover part or all of our patent portfolio across our breadth of technologies 
leading semiconductor and system companies such as amd  broadcom  elpida  freescale  fujitsu  ge  intel  panasonic  renesas  samsung and toshiba have licensed our patents for use in their own products 

table of contents we also derive additional revenue by licensing a range of technology solutions including our leadership and industry standard solutions to customers for use in their digital electronics products and systems 
our customers include leading companies such as elpida  ge  ibm  panasonic  samsung  sony and toshiba 
due to the often complex nature of implementing our technologies  we provide engineering services under certain of these licenses to help our customers successfully integrate our technology solutions into their semiconductor and system products 
licensees may also receive  in addition to their solutions license agreements  patent licenses as necessary to implement the technology in their products with specific rights and restrictions to the applicable patents elaborated in their individual contracts 
the remainder of our revenue is contract services revenue which includes license fees and engineering services fees 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on deferred revenue or account receivables in any given period 
we intend to continue making significant expenditures associated with engineering  marketing  general and administration including litigation expenses  and expect that these costs and expenses will continue to be a significant percentage of revenue in future periods 
whether such expenses increase or decrease as a percentage of revenue will be substantially dependent upon the rate at which our revenue or expenses change 
executive summary during  we renewed patent license agreements with panasonic and toshiba as well as signed a patent license agreement with freescale and broadcom 
as a result of the patent license agreement with both broadcom and freescale  we settled all outstanding claims with them  including resolution of past use of our patented innovations 
on june   we completed our largest acquisition to date  cri  a security research and development and licensing company 
we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of cri in exchange for cash of million and common stock with a value of approximately million at closing 
this acquisition expands the breadth of rambus technologies available for licensing with complementary technologies from cri that include patented innovations and solutions for content protection  network security and anti counterfeiting 
in connection with the acquisition of cri  we are obligated to pay retention bonuses to certain cri employees and contractors  subject to certain eligibility and acceleration provisions  including continued employment with us  in three equal amounts of approximately million  with the first payment paid in cash and the remaining payments in cash or stock at our election  on june   and  respectively 
the total retention bonus commitment is million and may be forfeited in part or whole by the covered employees and contractors upon voluntary departure from employment or discontinuation of services 
any amounts forfeited will be paid by us to a designated charity 
see note  acquisition  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion 
additionally  we signed a patent license agreement in with a major smartphone and tablet manufacturer for the use of cri s differential power analysis dpa countermeasures patents 
research and development continues to play a key role in our efforts to maintain product innovations 
our engineering expenses for the year ended december  increased million as compared to primarily due to increased headcount related costs of million from additional employees including employees from our cri acquisition to support our development efforts  the accrual of the cri retention bonuses of million and increased amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired of million 
our lower revenue combined with the increase in engineering expenses has caused engineering expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue 
marketing  general and administrative expenses in aggregate increased million for the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to litigation expenses being higher by million 
our lower revenue combined with the increase in marketing  general and administrative 
table of contents expenses  has caused marketing  general and administrative expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue 
additionally  for the year ended december   we incurred costs of restatement and related legal activities of million primarily due to the million settlement in the matter captioned stuart j 
steele  et al 
v 
rambus inc  et al  related to the previous stock option investigation  settling the claims against us and the individual defendants as well as the associated litigation expense 
trends there are a number of trends that may or will have a material impact on us in the future  including but not limited to  the evolution of memory technology  adoption of leds in general lighting  and global economic conditions with the resulting impact on sales of consumer electronic systems 
we have a high degree of revenue concentration  with our top five licensees representing approximately and  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as a result of our settlement with samsung in  samsung is expected to account for a significant portion of our ongoing licensing revenue 
for the year ended december   revenue from elpida  nvidia and samsung each accounted for or more of our total revenue 
for the year ended december   revenue from elpida and samsung each accounted for or more of our total revenue 
for the year ended december   revenue from amd  fujitsu  nec  panasonic  and toshiba  each accounted for or more of our total revenue 
we expect to continue to experience significant revenue concentration for the foreseeable future 
the particular licensees which account for revenue concentration have varied from period to period as a result of the addition of new contracts  expiration of existing contracts  renewals of existing contracts  industry consolidation and the volumes and prices at which the licensees have recently sold licensed semiconductors to system companies 
these variations are expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and highly cyclical 
our visibility with respect to future sales is very limited at this time 
to the extent that macroeconomic fluctuations negatively affect our principal licensees  the demand for our technology may be significantly and adversely impacted and we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in our operating results 
the royalties we receive from our semiconductor business are partly a function of the adoption of our chip interfaces by system companies 
many system companies purchase semiconductors containing our chip interfaces from our licensees and do not have a direct contractual relationship with us 
our licensees generally do not provide us with details as to the identity or volume of licensed semiconductors purchased by particular system companies 
as a result  we face difficulty in analyzing the extent to which our future revenue will be dependent upon particular system companies 
system companies face intense competitive pressure in their markets  which are characterized by extreme volatility  frequent new product introductions and rapidly shifting consumer preferences 
the display industry is also intensely competitive and highly cyclical 
since led backlighting solutions are increasingly pervasive in lcd for computers  smartphones  tablets  game systems  high definition televisions and any user interface incorporating an active display  the continued move to higher resolution displays across these products requires more leds per system 
the increased usage of leds is thereby creating a need for increased power efficiency since the led backlight is the primary source of power consumption in many consumer electronics products  including smartphones 
our ldt group has numerous patents in edge lit led lightguide technology 
our plans are to license our technology to key companies that use led edge lit display products 
the highly fragmented general lighting industry is undergoing a fundamental shift from incandescent technology to cold cathode fluorescent lights and led driven technology by the need to reduce energy consumption and to comply with government mandates 
led lighting typically saves 
table of contents energy costs as compared to existing installed lighting 
our ldt group has numerous patents in led edge lit lightguide technology which can be applied in the design of next generation led lighting products 
our goal is to be a major player in the general lighting industry with our technology and have established a technology center in brecksville  ohio 
our revenue from companies headquartered outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect that revenue derived from international licensees will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue in the future 
to date  all of the revenue from international licensees have been denominated in us dollars 
however  to the extent that such licensees sales to their customers are not denominated in us dollars  any royalties that we receive as a result of such sales could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  if the effective price of licensed semiconductors sold by our foreign licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies  demand for licensed semiconductors could fall  which in turn would reduce our royalties 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate risk 
for additional information concerning international revenue  see note  business segments and major customers  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
engineering costs in the aggregate and as a percentage of net sales increased in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
in the near term  we expect engineering costs to be higher than in as we intend to continue to make investments in the infrastructure and technologies required to maintain our product innovations in semiconductor and lighting technologies and newly acquired businesses  such as cri 
marketing  general and administrative expenses in the aggregate and as a percentage of net sales increased in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
historically  we have been involved in litigation stemming from the unlicensed use of our inventions 
our litigation expenses have been high and difficult to predict and future litigation expenses could be significant  volatile and difficult to predict 
if we are successful in the litigation and or related licensing  our revenue could be substantially higher in the future  if we are unsuccessful  our revenue may not grow or may decrease 
furthermore  our success in litigation matters pending before courts and regulatory bodies that relate to our intellectual property rights have impacted and will likely continue to impact our ability and the terms upon which we are able to negotiate new or renegotiate existing licenses for our technology 
we will continue to pursue litigation against those companies that have infringed our patented technologies  which in turn will keep litigation expenses significant until such litigation is resolved 
as we continue to pursue litigation and invest in research and development projects and if we experience lower revenue from our licensees in the future  our cash from operations will be negatively affected 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenue represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations years ended december  revenue royalties contract revenue total revenue operating costs and expenses cost of revenue research and development marketing  general and administrative costs recoveries of restatement and related legal activities  net gain from settlement total operating costs and expenses operating income loss interest income and other income  net interest expense on convertible notes interest and other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss includes stock based compensation cost of revenue research and development marketing  general and administrative years ended december  to change to change dollars in millions total revenue royalties contract revenue total revenue royalty revenue patent licenses our patent royalties decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to the one time recognition of royalty revenue from the settlement agreement signed with samsung in which was partially offset by the revenue recognized from one time and or ongoing licensing 
table of contents agreements with nvidia  broadcom  freescale and a major smartphone and tablet manufacturer in in  we renewed patent license agreements with toshiba and panasonic and signed new license agreements with freescale  broadcom and a major smartphone and tablet manufacturer 
some of these new agreements in had one time catch up royalty payments  and in the aggregate  for  these one time payments for past dues amounted to million dollars 
in  we renewed patent license agreements with amd  elpida and renesas 
in  we also signed patent license agreement with nvidia and settlement agreement with samsung 
the one time royalty payments from these new agreements in amounted to million 
excluding the non recurring portion from the patent royalties  the recurring patent royalties increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to the complete allocation of samsung s quarterly license payment to revenue since the second quarter of and revenue recognized from agreements signed since the third quarter of our patent royalties increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to the revenue recognized from the agreements signed with samsung and elpida during we are in negotiations with prospective licensees as well as existing licensees regarding renewals 
we expect patent royalties will continue to vary from period to period based on our success in renewing existing license agreements and adding new licensees  as well as the level of variation in our licensees reported shipment volumes  sales price and mix  offset in part by the proportion of licensee payments that are fixed or hybrid in nature 
solutions licenses royalties from solutions licenses decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to lower royalties reported from decreased shipments related to ddr technologies 
royalties from solutions licenses increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to higher royalties reported from increased shipments related to ddr technologies and higher royalties from xdr dram associated with increased shipments of the sony playstation product  partially offset by lower royalties from rdram controllers in the first half of due to a one time catch up royalty payment for the sony playstation product in the second quarter of in the future  we expect solutions royalties will continue to vary from period to period based on our licensees shipment volumes  sales prices  and product mix 
contract revenue contract revenue increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to new technology development contracts 
contract revenue decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to fewer new technology development contracts and decrease in work performed on existing technology development contracts 
we believe that contract revenue recognized will continue to fluctuate over time based on our ongoing contractual requirements  the amount of work performed  the timing of completing engineering 
table of contents deliverables  and by changes to work required  as well as new technology development contracts booked in the future 
engineering costs years ended december  to change to change dollars in millions engineering costs cost of revenue amortization of intangible assets stock based compensation total cost of revenue research and development stock based compensation total research and development total engineering costs engineering costs are allocated between cost of revenue and research and development expenses 
cost of revenue reflects the portion of the total engineering costs which are specifically devoted to individual licensee development and support services as well as amortization expense related to various acquired intellectual property for patent licensing 
the balance of engineering costs  incurred for the development of applicable technologies  is charged to research and development 
in a given period  the allocation of engineering costs between these two components is a function of the timing of the development and implementation schedules of individual licensee contracts 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  total engineering costs increased primarily due to increased headcount related costs of million from additional employees including employees from the cri acquisition to support our development efforts  increased amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired of million as well as the accrual of the cri retention bonuses of million and higher prototyping costs of million  offset by the million decrease in funding for our corporate incentive plan cip which is lower than our cip 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  total engineering costs increased primarily due to the increase in headcount from our ldt group and the funding for our cip  which included the employee bonus related to the samsung settlement  increase in patent research costs and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in a business combination in in the near term  we intend to continue to make investments in the infrastructure and technologies required to maintain our product innovation in semiconductor  lighting  security and other technologies 

table of contents marketing  general and administrative costs years ended december  to change to change dollars in millions marketing  general and administrative costs marketing  general and administrative costs litigation expense stock based compensation total marketing  general and administrative costs marketing  general and administrative expenses include expenses and costs associated with trade shows  public relations  advertising  litigation  general legal  insurance and other marketing and administrative efforts 
litigation expenses are a significant portion of our marketing  general and administrative expenses and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
consistent with our business model  our licensing and marketing activities aim to develop or strengthen relationships with potential and current licensees 
in addition  we work with current licensees through marketing  sales and technical efforts to drive adoption of their products that use our innovations and solutions  by system companies 
due to the long business development cycles we face and the semi fixed nature of marketing  general and administrative expenses in a given period  these expenses generally do not correlate to the level of revenue in that period or in recent or future periods 
for the year ended december  as compared to  total marketing  general and administrative costs increased primarily due to the increased litigation expenses of million related to ongoing major cases 
non litigation related marketing  general and administrative costs increased for the year ended december  primarily due to the accrual of the cri retention bonuses of million and increased headcount related costs of million from the increase in employees to support our business as well as higher consulting costs of million and the acquisition costs related to cri of million  offset by the million decrease in funding for our cip  which is lower than our cip  and lower stock based compensation expense of million 
for the year ended december  as compared to  total marketing  general and administrative costs decreased primarily due to lower litigation expenses 
non litigation related marketing  general and administrative costs increased for the year ended december  primarily due to funding for our cip  which included the employee bonus related to the samsung settlement  increased consulting fees  increased general legal expenses and increased headcount in corporate development commencing in as a result of our strategic initiatives to identify and acquire additional technology opportunities 
in the future  marketing  general and administrative costs will vary from period to period based on the trade shows  advertising  legal  acquisition and other marketing and administrative activities undertaken  and the change in sales  marketing and administrative headcount in any given period 
litigation expenses are expected to vary from period to period due to the variability of litigation activities

in  we recorded reimbursements of million from the insurance carriers and received million from former rambus executives as part of their settlement agreements with us in connection with the derivative and class action lawsuits in until all the litigation and related issues are resolved  we anticipate that there could be additional amounts relating to these matters in the future 
gain from settlement years ended december  to change to change dollars in millions gain from settlement n a n a not applicable the settlement with samsung is a multiple element arrangement for accounting purposes 
for a multiple element arrangement  we are required to determine the fair value of the elements 
we considered several factors in determining the accounting fair value of the elements of the settlement with samsung which included a third party valuation using an income approach  the black scholes merton option pricing model and a residual approach collectively the fair value 
the total gain from settlement is million  of which million was recognized during the year ended december  the total gain from settlement related to the settlement with samsung of million has been recognized as of the end of the first quarter of the gain from settlement represents the fair value of the cash consideration allocated to the resolution of the antitrust litigation settlement and the residual value of other elements

following the substantial completion of construction in the fourth quarter of  we occupied our sunnyvale and brecksville facilities 
in connection with the application of fasb authoritative guidance to our leases of the new facilities  we are deemed  in substance  to be the owner of the landlord s buildings  and therefore the estimated fair value of our portion of the buildings is required to be capitalized on our books as a non cash transaction  offset by a corresponding imputed financing obligation on our balance sheet 
the imputed financing obligations are amortized using the effective interest method with the imputed interest rate of approximately

since certain improvements constructed by us are considered structural in nature and given our responsibility for any cost overruns  for accounting purposes  we are treated in substance as the owner of the construction project during the construction period 
at completion  we concluded that we retained sufficient continuing involvement to preclude de recognition of the building under the fasb authoritative guidance applicable to the sale leasebacks of real estate 
as such  we continue to account for the building as owned real estate and to record an imputed financing obligation for our obligation to the legal owner 
pursuant to the terms of the sunnyvale lease  the landlord agreed to reimburse us approximately million  of which million was received in and million was received in we recognized the reimbursement as an additional imputed financing obligation under the fasb

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition overview we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer recognizing the revenue until such time as all criteria are met 
determination of whether or not these criteria have been met may require us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates based upon current information and historical experience 
our revenue consists of royalty revenue and contract revenue 
royalty revenue consists of patent license and solutions license royalties 
contract revenue consist of fixed license fees  fixed engineering fees and service fees associated with integration of our technology solutions into our customers products 
reseller arrangements generally provide for the pass through of a percentage of the fees paid to the reseller by the reseller s customer for use of our patent and solutions licenses 
we do not recognize revenue for these arrangements until we have received notice of revenue earned by and paid to the reseller  accompanied by the pass through payment from the reseller 
we do not pay commissions to the reseller for these arrangements 
in addition  we may enter into certain settlements of patent infringement disputes 
the amount of consideration received upon any settlement including but not limited to past royalty payments  future royalty payments and punitive damages is allocated to each element of the settlement based on the fair value of each element 
in addition  revenues related to past royalties are recognized upon execution of the agreement by both parties  provided that the amounts are fixed or determinable  there are no significant undelivered obligations and collectability is reasonably assured 
we do not recognize any revenues prior to execution of the agreement since there is no reliable basis on which we can estimate the amounts for royalties related to previous periods or assess collectability 
elements that are related to royalty revenue in nature including but not limited to past royalty payments and future royalty payments will be recorded as royalty revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
elements that are not related to royalty revenue in nature including but not limited to punitive damage and settlement will be recorded as gain from settlement which is reflected as a separate line item within the operating expenses section in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents many of our licensees have the right to cancel their licenses 
in such arrangements  revenue is only recognized to the extent that is consistent with the cancellation provisions 
cancellation provisions within such contracts generally provide for a prospective cancellation with no refund of fees already remitted by customers for products provided and payment for services rendered prior to the date of cancellation 
unbilled receivables represent enforceable claims and are deemed collectible in connection with our revenue recognition policy 
royalty revenue we recognize royalty revenue upon notification by our licensees and when deemed collectible 
the terms of the royalty agreements generally either require licensees to give us notification and to pay the royalties within days of the end of the quarter during which the sales occur or are based on a fixed royalty that is due within days of the end of the quarter 
we have two types of royalty revenue patent license royalties and solutions license royalties 
patent licenses 
we license our broad portfolio of patented inventions to companies who use these inventions in the development and manufacture of their own products 
such licensing agreements may cover the license of part  or all  of our patent portfolio 
the contractual terms of the agreements generally provide for payments over an extended period of time 
for the licensing agreements with fixed royalty payments  we generally recognize revenue from these arrangements as amounts become due 
for the licensing agreements with variable royalty payments which can be based on either a percentage of sales or number of units sold  we earn royalties at the time that the licensees sales occur 
our licensees  however  do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter 
as we are unable to estimate the licensees sales in any given quarter to determine the royalties due to us  we recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met 
solutions licenses 
we develop proprietary and industry standard products that we provide to our customers under solutions license agreements 
these arrangements include royalties  which can be based on either a percentage of sales or number of units sold 
we earn royalties on such licensed products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees sales occur 
our licensees  however  do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter 
as we are unable to estimate the licensees sales in any given quarter to determine the royalties due to us  we recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met 
contract revenue we generally recognize revenue using percentage of completion for development contracts related to licenses of our solutions that involve significant engineering and integration services 
for all license and service agreements accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we determine progress to completion using input measures based upon contract costs incurred 
we have evaluated use of output measures versus input measures and have determined that our output is not sufficiently uniform with respect to cost  time and effort per unit of output to use output measures as a measure of progress to completion 
part of these contract fees may be due upon the achievement of certain milestones  such as provision of certain deliverables by us or production of chips by the licensee 
the remaining fees may be due on pre determined dates and include significant up front fees 
a provision for estimated losses on fixed price contracts is made  if necessary  in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise the estimates of the total costs required to complete a contract  the total amount of revenue recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  to the extent the new assumptions regarding the total efforts necessary to complete a project are less than the original 
table of contents assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized sooner than originally expected 
conversely  if the newly estimated total efforts necessary to complete a project are longer than the original assumptions  the contract fees will be recognized over a longer period 
if application of the percentage of completion method results in recognizable revenue prior to an invoicing event under a customer contract  we will recognize the revenue and record an unbilled receivable 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognizable revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on deferred revenue or unbilled receivables in any given period 
litigation we are involved in certain legal proceedings  as discussed in note  litigation and asserted claims  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
based upon consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and an analysis of potential results  if we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated  we record the estimated liability in its consolidated financial statements 
if only a range of estimated losses can be estimated  we record an amount within the range that  in our judgment  reflects the most likely outcome  if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount  we record the liability at the low end of the range of estimates 
any such accrual would be charged to expense in the appropriate period 
we recognize litigation expenses in the period in which the litigation services were provided 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management based on the fair value of net assets received 
identifiable intangible assets are comprised of patents  customer contracts and contractual relationships  existing technology  intellectual property and other intangible assets 
identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using principally the straight line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years 
goodwill is not subject to amortization  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment  applying a fair value based test 
we evaluate goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill is allocation to various reporting units  which are generally an operating segment 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using an income or discounted cash flows approach 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
under the income approach  we measure fair value of the reporting unit based on a projected cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management which is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our discounted cash flow projections are based on our annual financial forecasts developed internally by management for use in managing our business 

table of contents we amortize other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
we record an impairment charge on these assets if we determine that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our other intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that the life of the asset may need to be revised 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant negative industry or economic trends  significant loss of clients  and significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure the potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
an impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset or other long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
different assumptions and judgments could materially affect the calculation of the fair value of our other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
as of december   the fair value of our sbg reporting unit  with million of goodwill  exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by approximately  the fair value of our ldt reporting unit  with million of goodwill  exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by approximately  and the fair value of our cri reporting unit  with million of goodwill  exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by approximately 
to arrive at our cash flow projections utilized in the income approach  we used the reporting unit s forecast of estimated operating results based on key assumptions such as long term revenue growth rates  costs and estimates of future anticipated changes in operating margins based on economic and market information 
key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units at december   were the expected after tax cash flows for the forecast period and terminal year  terminal growth rates and weighted average cost of capital 
certain estimates used in the income approach involve information from businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increase the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance 
one of the key assumptions used in applying the income approach include discount rates which ranged from to depending on the reporting units overall risk profile relative to other guideline companies  the reporting units respective industry as well as the visibility of future expected cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that business performance significantly below our expectations or a deterioration of market and economic conditions could occur 
this would adversely impact our ability to meet our projected results  which could cause the goodwill in any of our reporting units to become impaired 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 
if our ldt reporting unit is not successful in commercializing new business arrangements  or if we are unsuccessful in renewing our license agreements for the sbg and cri reporting units  the revenue and income for these reporting units could adversely and materially deviate from their historical trends and could cause goodwill to become impaired 
if we determine that our goodwill is impaired  we would be required to record a non cash charge that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

table of contents income taxes as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to calculate the income tax expense or benefit which relates to the pretax income or loss for the period 
in addition  we are required to assess the realization of the deferred tax asset or liability to be included on the consolidated balance sheet as of the reporting dates 
as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included net deferred tax assets  before valuation allowance  of approximately million  which consists of net operating loss carryovers  tax credit carryovers  amortization  employee stock based compensation expenses and certain liabilities  partially reduced by deferred tax liabilities associated with the convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlements 
for the year ended december   a valuation allowance of million reduced net deferred tax assets to million 
management periodically evaluates the realizability of our net deferred tax assets based on all available evidence  both positive and negative 
the realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods prior to the expiration of tax statutes to fully utilize these assets 
our forecasted future operating results are highly influenced by  among other factors  assumptions regarding our ability to achieve our forecasted revenue  our ability to effectively manage our expenses in line with our forecasted revenue and general trends in the semiconductor industry 
we weighed both positive and negative evidence and determined that there is a continued need for a valuation allowance due to projected future losses  which we considered significant negative evidence 
though considered positive evidence  projected income from potential favorable patent and related settlement litigation were not included in the determination for the valuation allowance due to our inability to reliably estimate and objectively verify the timing and amounts of such settlements 
even though we are no longer in a cumulative tax loss position for the last twelve quarters primarily due to certain discrete positive events  the projection of significant future losses is a negative factor that outweighs the positive factors leading to a conclusion that a release of the valuation allowance is not yet appropriate 
if any settlement income is realized  we will reassess our position on maintaining the valuation allowance 
tax attributes related to stock option windfall deductions are not to be recognized until they result in a reduction of cash taxes payable 
the benefit of these excess tax benefits will be recorded to equity when they reduce cash taxes payable 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
although fasb accounting standards codification asc income taxes  provides further clarification on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  significant judgment is required by management 
if the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated  a material impact on income tax expense could result 
stock based compensation we maintained stock plans covering a broad range of potential equity grants including stock options  nonvested equity stock and equity stock units and performance based instruments 
in addition  we sponsor an employee stock purchase plan espp  whereby eligible employees are entitled to purchase common stock semi annually  by means of limited payroll deductions  at a discount from the fair market value of the common stock as of specific dates 
the accounting guidance for share based payments requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense in our statement of operations for all share based payment awards made to our employees  directors and consultants including employee stock options  nonvested equity stock and equity stock units  and employee stock purchase grants 
stock based compensation expense is measured 
table of contents at grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  reduced by an estimate of the annualized rate of expected forfeitures  and is recognized as expense over the employees expected requisite service period  generally using the straight line method 
in addition  the accounting guidance for share based payments requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under previous accounting rules 
our forfeiture rate represents the historical rate at which our stock based awards were surrendered prior to vesting 
the accounting guidance for share based payments requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised on a cumulative basis  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
see note  equity incentive plans and stock based compensation  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for more information regarding the valuation of stock based compensation 
marketable securities available for sale securities are carried at fair value  based on quoted market prices  with the unrealized gains or losses reported  net of tax  in stockholders equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity  both of which are included in interest and other income  net 
realized gains and losses are recorded on the specific identification method and are included in interest and other income  net 
we review our investments in marketable securities for possible other than temporary impairments on a regular basis 
if any loss on investment is believed to be other than temporary  a charge will be recognized in operations 
in evaluating whether a loss on a debt security is other than temporary  we consider the following factors our intent to sell the security  if we intend to hold the security  whether or not it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the security s amortized cost basis and even if we intend to hold the security  whether or not we expect the security to recover the entire amortized cost basis 
due to the high credit quality and short term nature of our investments  there have been no other than temporary impairments recorded to date 
the classification of funds between short term and long term is based on whether the securities are available for use in operations or other purposes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily arising from the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our investment portfolio 
interest rate fluctuation may arise from changes in the market s view of the quality of the security issuer  the overall economic outlook  and the time to maturity of our portfolio 
we mitigate this risk by investing only in high quality  highly liquid instruments 
securities with original maturities of one year or less must be rated by two of the three industry standard rating agencies as follows a by standard poor s  p by moody s and or f by fitch 
securities with original maturities of greater than one year must be rated by two of the following industry standard rating agencies as follows aa by standard poor s  aa by moody s and or aa

by corporate investment policy  we limit the amount of exposure to million or of the portfolio  whichever is lower  for any single non us government issuer 
a single non us agency can represent up to of the portfolio 
no more than of the total portfolio may be invested in the securities of an industry sector  with money market fund investments evaluated separately 
our policy requires that at least of the portfolio be in securities with a maturity of days or less 
we may make investments in us treasuries  us agencies  corporate bonds and municipal bonds and notes with maturities up to months 
however  the bias of our investment portfolio is shorter maturities 
all investments must be us dollar denominated 
additionally  we have no significant exposure to european sovereign debt 
we invest our cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of us dollar financial instruments such as us treasuries  us government agencies  commercial paper and corporate notes 
our policy specifically prohibits trading securities for the sole purposes of realizing trading profits 
however  we may liquidate a portion of our portfolio if we experience unforeseen liquidity requirements 
in such a case  if the environment has been one of rising interest rates we may experience a realized loss  similarly  if the environment has been one of declining interest rates we may experience a realized gain 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income marketable securities of million including cash equivalents 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels as of december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million

table of contents the fair value of our convertible notes is subject to interest rate risk  market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature 
the fair value of the convertible notes will generally increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of the convertible notes will generally increase as our common stock price increases and will generally decrease as our common stock price declines in value 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our convertible notes but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation

our overseas operations consist primarily of one design center in india and small business development offices in germany  japan  korea and taiwan 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure  however  as of december   we believe our foreign currency exposure is not material enough to warrant foreign currency hedging
