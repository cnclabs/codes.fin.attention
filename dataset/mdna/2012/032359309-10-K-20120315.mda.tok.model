item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reinsurance 

table of contents interest rate risk 
we had fixed maturity securities excluding million of time and short term deposits with a fair value of billion and a carrying value of billion as of december  that are subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of our fixed maturity securities 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through a disciplined asset and liability matching and capital management process 
in the management of this risk  the characteristics of duration  credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements 
these risks are assessed regularly and balanced within the context of our liability and capital position 
the table below summarizes the interest rate risk associated with our fixed maturity securities by illustrating the sensitivity of the fair value and carrying value of our fixed maturity securities as of december  to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  and the associated impact on our stockholders equity 
we anticipate that we will continue to meet our obligations out of income 
we classify our fixed securities and equity securities as available for sale 
temporary changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities impact the carrying value of these securities and are reported in our shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes 
the selected scenarios in the table below are not predictions of future events  but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such events may have on the fair value and carrying value of our fixed maturity securities and on our shareholders equity  each as of december

we currently have million of debt instruments of which million are fixed rate debt instruments 
a fluctuation of basis points in interest on our variable rate debt instruments  which are tied to libor  would affect our earnings and cash flows by million before income tax  on an annual basis  but would not affect the fair market value of the variable rate debt 
foreign currency risk 
we write insurance in the united kingdom and certain other european union member countries through aiu and ael 
while the functional currency of aiu and ael are  respectively  the euro and the british pound  we write coverages that are settled in local currencies  including  primarily  the euro and the british pound 
we attempt to maintain sufficient local currency assets on deposit to minimize our exposure to realized currency losses 
assuming a increase in the exchange rate of the local currency in which the claims will be paid and that we do not hold that local currency  we would recognize a million before tax realized currency loss based on our outstanding foreign denominated reserves of million at december  equity price risk 
equity price risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio  which include common stocks  non redeemable preferred stocks and master limited partnerships 
we classify our portfolio of equity securities as available for sale and carry these securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
accordingly  adverse changes in the market prices of our equity securities result in a decrease in the value of our total assets and a decrease in our shareholders equity 
as of december   the equity securities in our investment portfolio had a fair value of million  representing approximately two percent of our total invested assets on that date 

table of contents the table below illustrates the impact on our equity portfolio and financial position given a hypothetical movement in the broader equity markets 
the selected scenarios in the table below are not predictions of future events  but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such events may have on the carrying value of our equity portfolio and on shareholders equity as of december  the hypothetical scenarios below assume that our beta is when compared to the s p index
