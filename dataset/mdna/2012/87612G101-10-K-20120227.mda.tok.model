item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and notes included in part iv of this annual report 
also  the partnership files a separate annual report on form k with the sec 
overview financial presentation an indirect subsidiary of ours is the general partner of the partnership 
because we control the general partner  under generally accepted accounting principles we must reflect our ownership interest in the partnership on a consolidated basis 
accordingly  the partnership s financial results are included in our consolidated financial statements even though the distribution or transfer of partnership assets are limited by the terms of the partnership agreement  as well as restrictive covenants in the partnership s lending agreements 
the limited partner interests in the partnership not owned by us are reflected in our results of operations as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
therefore  throughout this discussion  we make a distinction where relevant between financial results of the partnership versus those of us as a standalone parent including our non partnership subsidiaries 
see condensed parent only financial statements included under note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f in this annual report 
as a result of the conveyance of all of our remaining operating assets to the partnership in september  we have no separate  direct operating activities apart from those conducted by the partnership 
as such  our cash inflows will primarily consist of cash distributions from our interests in the partnership 
the partnership is required to distribute all available cash at the end of each quarter after establishing reserves to provide for the proper conduct of its business or to provide for future distributions 
the partnership files its own separate annual report 
the results of operations included in our consolidated financial statements will differ from the results of operations of the partnership primarily due to the financial effects of noncontrolling interests in the partnership  our separate debt obligations  certain general and administrative costs applicable to us as a separate public company  federal income taxes  and certain non operating assets and liabilities that we retained 
our operations currently  we have no separate  direct operating activities apart from those conducted by the partnership 
as such  our cash inflows will primarily consist of cash distributions from our interests in the partnership 
the partnership is required to distribute all available cash at the end of each quarter after establishing reserves to provide for the proper conduct of its business or to provide for future distributions 
the partnership s operations the partnership is engaged in the business of gathering  compressing  treating  processing and selling natural gas  storing  fractionating  treating  transporting and selling ngls and ngl products  and storing and terminaling refined petroleum products and crude oil 
the partnership reports its operations in two divisions i natural gas gathering and processing  consisting of two reportable segments a field gathering and processing and b coastal gathering and processing  and ii logistics and marketing consisting of two reportable segments a logistics assets and b marketing and distribution 
the financial results of the partnership s hedging activities are reported in other 

table of contents the partnership s natural gas gathering and processing division includes assets used in the gathering of natural gas produced from oil and gas wells and processing this raw natural gas into merchantable natural gas by extracting ngls and removing impurities 
the field gathering and processing segment s assets are located in north texas and the permian basin of west texas and new mexico 
the coastal gathering and processing segment s assets are located in the onshore and near offshore regions of the louisiana gulf coast and the gulf of mexico 
the partnership s logistics and marketing division is also referred to as the downstream business 
the downstream business includes all the activities necessary to convert raw ngls into ngl products and provides certain value added services such as storing  terminaling  transporting  distributing and marketing of ngls  refined petroleum products and crude oil 
it also includes certain natural gas supply and marketing activities in support of the partnership s other operations 
the partnership s logistics assets segment is involved in transporting  storing and fractionating mixed ngls  storing  terminaling and transporting finished ngls  and storing and terminaling refined petroleum products and crude oil 
these assets are generally connected to  and supplied in part by  the partnership s natural gas gathering and processing segments and are predominantly located in mont belvieu  texas and southwestern louisiana 
this segment includes the activities associated with the partnership s acquisitions of refined petroleum products and crude oil storage and terminaling facilities 
see developments 
the partnership s marketing and distribution segment covers activities required to distribute and market raw and finished natural gas liquids and all natural gas marketing activities 
it includes marketing the partnership s ngl production and purchasing ngl products in selected united states markets  providing liquefied petroleum gas balancing services to refinery customers  transporting  storing and selling propane and providing related propane logistics services to multi state retailers  independent retailers and other end users  and marketing natural gas available to the partnership from the partnership s natural gas gathering and processing division and the purchase and resale of natural gas in selected united states markets 
other contains the results of the partnership s commodity hedging activities 
factors that significantly affect our results our cash flow and resulting ability to pay dividends will be dependent upon the partnership s ability to make distributions to its partners  including us 
the actual amount of cash that the partnership will have available for distributions will depend primarily on the amount of cash that it generates from its operations 
as of february   our interests in the partnership consist of the following a general partner interest  which we hold through our ownership interest in the general partner of the partnership  all idrs  and  of the  outstanding common units of the partnership  representing a limited partnership interest 
factors that significantly affect the partnership s results the partnership s results of operations are substantially impacted by the volumes that move through its gathering  processing and logistics assets  changes in commodity prices  contract terms  the impact of hedging activities and the cost to operate and support assets 
volumes 
in the partnership s gathering and processing operations  plant inlet volumes and capacity utilization rates generally are driven by wellhead production  its competitive and contractual position on a regional basis and more broadly by the impact of prices for oil  natural gas and ngls on exploration and production activity in the areas of its operations 
the factors that impact the gathering and processing volumes also impact the total volumes that flow to the partnership s downstream business 
in addition  fractionation volumes are also affected by the location of the resulting mixed ngls  available pipeline capacity to transport ngls to the partnership s fractionators  and the partnership s competitive and contractual position relative to other fractionators

illustrative targa ngl contains ethane  propane  natural gasoline  isobutane and normal butane 
crude oil prices are based on quarterly and annual averages of daily prices from west texas intermediate commercial index prices as measured on the nymex 
contract terms  contract mix and the impact of commodity prices 
because of the significant volatility of natural gas and ngl prices  the contract mix of the partnership s natural gas gathering and processing segment can also have a significant impact on its profitability  especially those that create exposure to changes in energy prices equity volumes 
set forth below is a table summarizing the mix of the partnership s natural gas gathering and processing contracts for and the potential impacts of commodity prices on operating margins percent of contract type throughput impact of commodity prices percent of proceeds percent of liquids decreases in natural gas and or ngl prices generate decreases in operating margins 
fee based no direct impact from commodity price movements 
wellhead purchases keep whole increases in natural gas prices relative to ngl prices generate decreases in operating margin 
hybrid in periods of favorable processing economics  similar to percent of liquids or to wellhead purchases keep whole in some circumstances  if economically advantageous to the processor 
in periods of unfavorable processing economics  similar to fee based 
favorable processing economics typically occur when processed ngls can be sold  after allowing for processing costs  at a higher value than natural gas on a btu equivalent basis 

table of contents negotiated contract terms are based upon a variety of factors  including natural gas quality  geographic location  the competitive commodity and pricing environment at the time the contract is executed  and customer requirements 
the gathering and processing contract mix and  accordingly  the exposure to natural gas and ngl prices  may change as a result of producer preferences  competition  and changes in production as wells decline at different rates or are added  the partnership s expansion into regions where different types of contracts are more common as well as other market factors 
the contract terms and contract mix of the downstream business can also have a significant impact on its results of operations 
during periods of low relative demand for available fractionation capacity  rates were low and frac or pay contracts were not readily available 
currently  demand for fractionation services is near existing industry capacity  rates have increased  contract lengths have increased and reservation fees are required 
these fractionation contracts in the logistics assets segment are primarily fee based arrangements while the marketing and distribution segment includes both fee based and percent of proceeds contracts 
impact of the partnership s commodity price hedging activities 
in an effort to reduce the variability of its cash flows  the partnership has hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of its expected natural gas and ngl equity volumes through and condensate equity volumes through by entering into derivative instruments including swaps and purchased puts or floors 
with these arrangements  the partnership has attempted to mitigate its exposure to commodity price movements with respect to its forecasted gas plant volumes for these periods 
the partnership also actively manages product inventory and other working capital levels to reduce its downstream exposure to changing ngl prices 
for additional information regarding the partnership s hedging activities  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
operating expenses 
variable costs such as fuel  utilities  power  service and repairs can impact the partnership s results as volumes fluctuate through its systems 
continued expansion of existing assets will also give rise to additional operating expenses  which will affect the partnership s results 
general and administrative expenses 
under the omnibus agreement we have with the partnership  which runs through april  we provide general and administrative and other services associated with the partnership s existing assets and any future conveyances by us and subject to mutual agreement  future acquisitions from third parties 
since october   substantially all of our general and administrative costs have been and  so long as our only cash generating assets are ownership interests in the partnership  will continue to be allocated to the partnership  other than our direct costs of being a public reporting company 
general trends and outlook we expect the midstream energy business environment to continue to be affected by the following key trends demand for our services  commodity prices  volatile capital markets and increased regulation 
these expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us 
to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect  our actual results may vary materially from our expected results 
demand for the partnership s services 
fluctuations in energy prices can affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of oil and natural gas reserves 
generally  drilling and production activity will increase as energy prices increase 
we believe that the current strength of oil  condensate and ngl prices as compared to natural gas prices has caused producers in and around the partnership s natural gas gathering and processing areas of operation to focus their drilling programs on regions rich in liquid forms of hydrocarbons 
this focus is reflected in increased drilling permits and higher rig counts in these areas  and we expect these activities to lead to higher inlet volumes in the field gathering and processing segment over the next several years 
while we expect demand for the partnership s ngl products to remain strong  a reduction in demand for ngl products or a significant increase in ngl product supply relative to this demand  could impact the partnership s business 
increases in demand for international grade propane  along with expansion in the petrochemical industry  which relies on ethane as a feedstock  point towards sustained demand for the partnership s terminaling and storage services in the downstream business 
producer activity in areas rich in oil  condensate and ngls is currently generating increased demand for the partnership s fractionation services and for related fee based services provided by the downstream business 
while we expect development activity to remain robust with respect to oil and liquids rich gas development and production  currently depressed natural gas prices have resulted in reduced activity levels surrounding comparatively dry natural gas reserves  whether conventional or unconventional 

table of contents commodity prices 
current forward commodity prices as of december  show natural gas prices strengthening while ngl and crude oil prices weaken on an absolute price basis 
various industry commodity price forecasts based on fundamental analysis may differ significantly from forward market prices 
both are subject to change due to multiple factors 
there has been and we believe there will continue to be significant volatility in commodity prices and in the relationships among ngl  crude oil and natural gas prices 
in addition  the volatility and uncertainty of natural gas  crude oil and ngl prices impact drilling  completion and other investment decisions by producers and ultimately supply to the partnership s systems 
the partnership s operating income generally improves in an environment of higher natural gas  ngl and condensate prices  primarily as a result of its percent of proceeds contracts 
the partnership s processing profitability is largely dependent upon pricing  the supply of and market demand for natural gas  ngls and condensate  which are beyond its control and have been volatile 
recent weak economic conditions have negatively affected the pricing and market demand for natural gas which caused a reduction in profitability of the partnership s processing operations 
in a declining commodity price environment  without taking into account the partnership s hedges  it will realize a reduction in cash flows under its percent of proceeds contracts proportionate to average price declines 
the partnership has attempted to mitigate its exposure to commodity price movements by entering into hedging arrangements 
for additional information regarding hedging activities  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
volatile capital markets 
we and the partnership are dependent on our abilities to access equity and debt capital markets in order to fund acquisitions and expansion expenditures 
global financial markets have been  and are expected to continue to be  volatile and disrupted and weak economic conditions may cause a significant decline in commodity prices 
as a result  we and the partnership may be unable to raise equity or debt capital on satisfactory terms  or at all  which may negatively impact the timing and extent to which we and the partnership execute growth plans 
prolonged periods of low commodity prices or volatile capital markets may impact our and the partnership s ability or willingness to enter into new hedges  fund organic growth  connect to new supplies of natural gas  execute acquisitions or implement expansion capital expenditures 
increased regulation 
additional regulation in various areas has the potential to materially impact the partnership s operations and financial condition 
for example  increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing used by producers may cause reductions in supplies of natural gas and of ngls from producers 
please read risk factors increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells  which could adversely impact the partnership s revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas that it gathers  processes and fractionates 
similarly  the forthcoming rules and regulations of the cftc may limit the partnership s ability or increase the cost to use derivatives  which could create more volatility and less predictability in its results of operations 
please read risk factors the recent adoption of derivatives legislation by the united states congress could have an adverse effect on the partnership s ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price  interest rate and other risks associated with its business 
how we evaluate our operations our consolidated operations include the operations of the partnership due to our ownership and control of the general partner 
we currently have no separate  direct operating activities from those conducted by the partnership 
our financial results differ from the partnership s due to the financial effects of noncontrolling interests in the partnership  our separate debt obligations  certain non operating costs associated with assets and liabilities that we retained and were not included in asset conveyances to the partnership  and certain general and administrative costs applicable to us as a separate public company 
management s primary measure of analyzing our performance is the non gaap measure distributable cash flow 
distributable cash flow 
we define distributable cash flow as distributions due to us from the partnership  less our specific general and administrative costs as a separate public reporting entity  the interest carry costs associated with our debt and taxes attributable to our earnings 
distributable cash flow is a significant performance metric used by us and by external users of our financial statements  such as investors  commercial banks  research analysts  and others to compare basic cash flows generated by us to the cash dividends we expect to pay our shareholders 
using this metric  management and external users of our financial statements can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to planned cash dividends 
distributable cash flow is also an important financial measure for our shareholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment 
specifically  this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly dividend rates 
distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community because the share value is generally determined by the share s yield which in turn is based on the amount of cash dividends the entity pays to a shareholder 

table of contents the economic substance behind our use of distributable cash flow is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash flow sufficient to pay dividends to our investors 
the gaap measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net income 
distributable cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income 
distributable cash flow is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool 
investors should not consider distributable cash flow in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because distributable cash flow excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and is defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of distributable cash flow may not be compatible to similarly titled measures of other companies  thereby diminishing its utility 
management compensates for the limitations of distributable cash flow as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable gaap measure  understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into its decision making process 
on january   the partnership announced that the board of directors of its general partner declared a quarterly distribution for the three months ended december  of per common unit  or an annual rate of per common unit 
based on these distribution rates  we will receive quarterly distributions of million  or million on an annualized basis  in respect of our common units in the partnership  and based on these distribution rates  we will receive quarterly distributions of million and million  or million and million on an annualized basis  based on our idrs and general partner interests

how we evaluate the partnership s operations the partnership s profitability is a function of the difference between i the revenues the partnership receives from its operations  including fee based revenues from services and revenues from the natural gas  ngls and condensate the partnership sells  and ii the costs associated with conducting the partnership s operations  including the costs of wellhead natural gas and mixed ngls that the partnership purchases as well as operating and general and administrative costs and the impact of commodity hedging activities 
because commodity price movements tend to impact both revenues and costs  increases or decreases in the partnership s revenues alone are not necessarily indicative of increases or decreases in its profitability 
the partnership s contract portfolio  the prevailing pricing environment for natural gas and ngls  and the volumes of natural gas and ngl throughput on its systems are important factors in determining its profitability 
the partnership s profitability is also affected by the ngl content in gathered wellhead natural gas  supply and demand for its products and services and changes in its customer mix 
aside from commodity based revenues  the partnership s profitability is also impacted by fee based revenues 
the partnership s growth strategy  largely based on third party acquisitions of businesses and assets as well as expansion of existing facilities  emphasizes assets that generate fee based revenues 
fixed fees for services such as storage and terminaling are more attractive to the partnership s investors because these revenues are not susceptible to changes in market prices for commodities or to changes in the efficiency of the partnership s operational environments 
management uses a variety of financial measures and operational measurements to analyze the partnership s performance 
these include throughput volumes  facility efficiencies and fuel consumption  operating expenses and the following non gaap measures gross margin  operating margin  adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow 
throughput volumes  facility efficiencies and fuel consumption 
the partnership s profitability is impacted by its ability to add new sources of natural gas supply to offset the natural decline of existing volumes from natural gas wells that are connected to its gathering and processing systems 
this is achieved by connecting new wells and adding new volumes in existing areas of production  as well as by capturing natural gas supplies currently gathered by third parties 
similarly  the partnership s profitability is impacted by its ability to add new sources of mixed ngl supply  typically connected by third party transportation  to its downstream business fractionation facilities 
the partnership fractionates ngls generated by its gathering and processing plants  as well as by contracting for mixed ngl supply from third party gathering  fractionation and export facilities 

table of contents in addition  the partnership seeks to increase operating margin by limiting volume losses and reducing fuel consumption by increasing compression efficiency 
with its gathering systems extensive use of remote monitoring capabilities  the partnership monitors the volumes of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points along its gathering systems  the volume of natural gas received at its processing plant inlets and the volumes of ngls and residue natural gas recovered by its processing plants 
the partnership also monitors the volumes of ngls received  stored  fractionated and delivered across its logistics assets 
this information is tracked through its processing plants and downstream business facilities to determine customer settlements for sales and volume related fees for service and help the partnership increase efficiency and reduce fuel consumption 
as part of monitoring the efficiency of its operations  the partnership measures the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points on its gathering systems and the volume received at the inlet of its processing plants as an indicator of fuel consumption and line loss 
the partnership also tracks the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the inlet of the processing plant and the ngls and residue gas produced at the outlet of such plant to monitor the fuel consumption and recoveries of the facilities 
similar tracking is performed for its logistics assets 
these volume  recovery and fuel consumption measurements are an important part of the partnership s operational efficiency analysis 
operating expenses 
operating expenses are costs associated with the operation of a specific asset 
labor  contract services  repair and maintenance  utilities and ad valorem taxes comprise the most significant portion of the partnership s operating expenses 
these expenses  other than fuel and power  generally remain relatively stable and independent of the volumes through its systems but fluctuate depending on the scope of the activities performed during a specific period 
gross margin 
we define gross margin as revenues less purchases 
it is impacted by volumes and commodity prices as well as the partnership s contract mix and hedging program 
we define natural gas gathering and processing gross margin as total operating revenues from the sales of natural gas and ngls plus service fee revenues  less product purchases  which consist primarily of producer payments and other natural gas purchases 
logistics assets gross margin consists primarily of service fee revenue 
gross margin for marketing and distribution equals total revenue from service fees and ngl sales  less cost of sales  which consists primarily of ngl purchases  transportation costs and changes in inventory valuation 
the gross margin impacts of cash flow hedge settlements are reported in other 
operating margin 
operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of the partnership s operations 
we define operating margin as gross margin less operating expenses 
natural gas and ngl sales revenue includes settlement gains and losses on commodity hedges 
gross margin and operating margin are non gaap measures 
the gaap measure most directly comparable to gross margin and operating margin is net income 
gross margin and operating margin are not alternatives to gaap net income and have important limitations as analytical tools 
investors should not consider gross margin and operating margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the partnership s results as reported under gaap 
because gross margin and operating margin exclude some  but not all  items that affect net income and are defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of gross margin and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies  thereby diminishing their utility 
our management reviews business segment gross margin and operating margin monthly as a core internal management process 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results 
gross margin and operating margin provide useful information to investors because they are used as supplemental financial measures by us and by external users of our financial statements  including investors and commercial banks  to assess the financial performance of the partnership s assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  the partnership s operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector  without regard to financing or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 

table of contents management compensates for the limitations of gross margin and operating margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap measures  understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into its decision making processes 
adjusted ebitda 
the partnership defines adjusted ebitda as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  gains or losses on debt repurchases and non cash risk management activities related to derivative instruments 
adjusted ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by the partnership and by external users of our financial statements such as investors  commercial banks and others 
the economic substance behind the partnership s use of adjusted ebitda is to measure the ability of its assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support its indebtedness and make distributions to its investors 
the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net cash provided by operating activities and net income 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net cash provided by operating activities or gaap net income 
adjusted ebitda is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool 
investors should not consider adjusted ebitda in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because adjusted ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities and is defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
the partnership compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable gaap measures  understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into its decision making processes 
distributable cash flow 
the partnership defines distributable cash flow as net income attributable to targa resources partners lp plus depreciation and amortization  deferred taxes and amortization of debt issue costs included in interest expense  adjusted for non cash losses gains on mark to market derivative contracts and debt repurchases  less maintenance capital expenditures net of any reimbursements of project costs 
the impact of noncontrolling interests is included in this measure 
distributable cash flow is a significant performance metric used by the partnership and by external users of the partnership s financial statements  such as investors  commercial banks and research analysts  to compare basic cash flows generated by the partnership prior to the establishment of any retained cash reserves by the board of directors of its general partner to the cash distributions the partnership expects to pay the partnership s unitholders 
using this metric  the partnership s management and external users of its financial statements can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to planned cash distributions 
distributable cash flow is also an important financial measure for the partnership s unitholders since it serves as an indicator of the partnership s success in providing a cash return on investment 
specifically  this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not the partnership is generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in the partnership s quarterly distribution rates 
distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships and limited liability companies because the value of a unit of such an entity is generally determined by the unit s yield which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder

it typically represents the cash settlements on the partnership s derivative contracts 
other also includes deferred gains or losses on previously terminated or de designated hedge contracts that are reclassified to revenues upon the occurrence of the underlying physical transactions 
the primary purpose of the partnership s commodity risk management activities is to manage its exposure to commodity price risk and reduce volatility in its operating cash flow due to fluctuations in commodity prices 
the partnership has hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of its expected natural gas  ngl and condensate equity volumes by entering into derivative financial instruments 
because the partnership is essentially forward selling a portion of its plant equity volumes  these hedge positions will move favorably in periods of falling prices and unfavorably in periods of rising prices

our liquidity and capital resources we have no separate  direct operating activities apart from those conducted by the partnership 
as such  our ability to finance our operations  including payment of dividends to our common stockholders  funding capital expenditures and acquisitions  or to meet our indebtedness obligations  will depend on cash inflows from future cash distributions to us from our interests in the partnership 
the partnership is required to distribute all available cash at the end of each quarter after establishing reserves to provide for the proper conduct of its business or to provide for future distributions 
see item a 
risk factors 
as of february   our interests in the partnership consist of the following a general partner interest  which we hold through our ownership interest in the general partner of the partnership  all of the outstanding idrs  and  of the  outstanding common units of the partnership  representing a limited partnership interest 
our ownership of the general partner interest entitles us to receive of all cash distributed in respect for that quarter 
our ownership of the idrs of the partnership entitles us to receive of all cash distributed in a quarter after has been distributed in respect of each common unit of the partnership for that quarter  of all cash distributed in a quarter after has been distributed in respect of each common unit of the partnership for that quarter  and of all cash distributed in a quarter after has been distributed in respect of each common unit of the partnership for that quarter 

table of contents subsequent event 
on january   the partnership announced that the board of directors of its general partner declared a quarterly distribution for the three months ended december  of per common unit  or an annual rate of per common unit 
this distribution was paid on february  based on these current distribution rates  we will receive distributions in future quarters and years of million or million annually based on our common units in the partnership  million or million annually based on our idrs  and million or million annually based on our general partner interests 
we intend to pay to our stockholders  on a quarterly basis  dividends equal to the cash the partnership distributes to us based on our ownership of partnership securities  less the expenses of being a public company  other general and administrative expenses  federal income taxes  capital contributions to the partnership and reserves established by our board of directors

subsequent event 
on january   we announced a quarterly dividend of per share of our common stock for the three months ended december   or per share on an annualized basis 
the declared dividend totals million  including million with respect to accrued dividends related to unvested restricted stock grants 
the cash dividend of million was paid on february  as of december   we had million of cash on hand  including million of cash belonging to the partnership 
we do not have access to the partnership s cash as it is restricted for the use of the partnership 
we have the ability to use million of the cash on hand and available to us to satisfy our aggregate tax liability of approximately million over the next thirteen years associated with our sales of assets to the partnership and related financings 
on january   we used million of available cash to purchase an additional  common units of the partnership as part of a public offering by the partnership of  common units 
the partnership s cash generated from operations has been sufficient to finance its operating expenditures and non acquisition related capital expenditures 
based on our anticipated levels of the partnership s operations and absent any disruptive events  we believe that internally generated cash flow  borrowings available under the partnership s revolver and proceeds from unit offerings should provide sufficient resources to finance its operations  capital expenditures  long term debt obligations  collateral requirements and minimum quarterly cash distribution for at least the next twelve months 
our future cash flows will consist of distributions to us from our interests in the partnership  from which we intend to make quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders from available cash 
based on our anticipated levels of distributions that we expect to receive from the partnership  cash generated from this interest should provide sufficient resources to finance our operations  long term debt and quarterly cash dividends for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents the impact on us of changes in the partnership s distribution levels will vary depending on several factors  including the partnership s total outstanding partnership interests on the record date for the distribution  the aggregate cash distributions made by the partnership and the interests in the partnership owned by us 
if the partnership increases distributions to its unitholders  including us  we would expect to increase dividends to our stockholders  although the timing and amount of such increased dividends  if any  will not necessarily be comparable to the timing and amount of the increase in distributions made by the partnership 
in addition  the level of distributions we receive and of dividends we pay to our stockholders may be affected by the various risks associated with an investment in us and the underlying business of the partnership

risk factors for more information about the risks that may impact your investment in us 
the partnership s liquidity and capital resources the partnership s ability to finance its operations  including funding capital expenditures and acquisitions  to meet its debt obligations  to refinance its debt and to meet its collateral requirements will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future 
the partnership s ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors  some of which are beyond its control  including weather  commodity prices  particularly for natural gas and ngls  and its ongoing efforts to manage operating costs and maintenance capital expenditures  as well as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors 
the partnership s main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations  borrowings under its revolver  the issuance of additional common units and access to debt markets 
the capital markets continue to experience volatility 
many financial institutions have had liquidity concerns  prompting government intervention to mitigate pressure on the credit markets 
the partnership s exposure to current credit conditions includes its credit facility  cash investments and counterparty performance risks 
continued volatility in the debt markets may increase costs associated with issuing debt instruments due to increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks and affect our ability to access those markets 
as of february   the partnership s liquidity of billion consisted of million of available cash and billion of available borrowings under its credit facility 
the partnership continually monitors its liquidity and the credit markets  as well as events and circumstances surrounding each of the lenders in its credit facility 
the partnership may issue additional equity or debt securities to assist in meeting future liquidity and capital spending requirements 
the partnership has filed with the sec a universal shelf registration statement that  subject to effectiveness at the time of use  allows it to issue up to an aggregate of million of debt or equity securities the shelf 
as of december   the partnership had million of available securities under the shelf 
on october   the partnership filed a prospectus supplement under the shelf that allows it to issue common units  representing limited partner interests having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through an equity distribution agreement with citigroup global markets  inc sales of common units  if any  will be by means of ordinary brokers transactions through the facilities of the nyse at market prices  in block transactions or as otherwise agreed between us and the sales agent 
the shelf expires in july the partnership also has filed with the sec a universal shelf registration statement the shelf  which provides it with the ability to offer and sell an unlimited amount of debt and equity securities  subject to market conditions and its capital needs 
the partnership s august  january and january equity offerings were conducted under the shelf 
subsequent events 
on january   the partnership completed a public offering of  common units under its shelf at a price of per common unit per common unit  net of underwriting discounts 
as part of this offering  we purchased  common units with an aggregate value of million based on the offering price of 
the units we purchased were not subject to any underwriter discounts or commissions 
net proceeds to the partnership from this offering were approximately million 
pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option  the partnership sold an additional  common units  providing net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  we contributed million for  general partner units to maintain our general partner interest 
on january  the partnership privately placed million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes the notes due the notes resulted in approximately million of net proceeds  which was used to reduce borrowings under the partnership s revolver and for general partnership purposes 

table of contents risk management 
the partnership continues to evaluate counterparty risks related to its commodity derivative contracts and trade credit 
the partnership has all of its commodity derivatives with major financial institutions or major oil companies 
should any of these financial counterparties not perform  the partnership may not realize the benefit of some of its hedges under lower commodity prices  which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operation 
the partnership sells its natural gas  ngls and condensate to a variety of purchasers 
non performance by a trade creditor could result in losses 
crude oil and natural gas prices are also volatile 
in an effort to reduce the variability of the partnership s cash flows  the partnership has hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of its expected natural gas and ngl equity volumes through and its condensate equity volumes through by entering into derivative financial instruments including swaps and purchased puts or floors 
with these arrangements  the partnership has attempted to mitigate its exposure to commodity price movements with respect to its forecasted volumes for this period 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
the current market conditions may also impact the partnership s ability to enter into future commodity derivative contracts 
a significant reduction in commodity prices could reduce the partnership s operating margins and cash flow from operations to the extent that such operating margins and cash flows derive from the portion of equity volumes that are not hedged 
the partnership s risk management position has moved from a net liability of million at december  to a net liability of million at december  the partnership terminated its interest rate swap contracts in september  which eliminated a liability of million from its books 
additionally  forward prices for natural gas are below the fixed prices the partnership receives on those derivative contracts  creating an asset valued at million  while forward prices on crude oil and ngls are above the fixed prices the partnership receives on those derivative contracts  creating a liability valued at million 
consequently  expected future receipts on derivative contracts are less than expected future payments  creating a net liability of million 
the partnership accounts for derivatives that mitigate commodity price risk as cash flow hedges 
changes in fair value are deferred in oci until the underlying hedged transactions settle 
working capital 
working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities 
the partnership s working capital is primarily impacted by changes in inventory  which is closely managed to maintain minimum levels 
on a consolidated basis at the end of any given month  accounts receivable and payable tied to commodity sales and purchases are relatively balanced with downstream receivables from ngl customers offset by plant settlements payable owed producers 
the partnership s cash generated from operations has been sufficient to finance its operating expenditures and both acquisition and non acquisition related capital expenditures 
based on our anticipated levels of the partnership s operations and absent any disruptive events  we believe that the partnership s internally generated cash flow  borrowings available under its revolver and proceeds from unit offerings and debt offerings should provide sufficient resources to finance its operations  capital expenditures  long term debt obligations  collateral requirements and minimum quarterly cash distribution for at least the next twelve months 
a significant portion of the partnership s capital resources may be utilized in the form of letters of credit to satisfy certain counterparty credit requirements 
while the partnership s credit rating has improved this year  these letters of credit reflect the partnership s non investment grade status  as assigned to us by moody s investors service  inc and standard poor s corporation  and counterparties views of the partnership s financial condition and ability to satisfy its performance obligations  as well as commodity prices and other factors 
at december   the partnership s total outstanding letter of credit postings were million

table of contents in  partnership derivative settlements were a net cash outflow  as opposed to a net inflow in the change in cash paid to derivative counterparties reflects the change in the partnership s net position from in the money for the period ending december  to out of the money for the period ending december  reflecting higher commodity prices than the fixed prices we receive on derivative contracts  a payment for interest rate swap termination in the amount of million in september and total payments for ethane call options in the amount of million in october partnership cash receipts from derivative counterparties were lower in compared to because commodity prices  although higher than the fixed prices we receive on derivative contracts  were closer to the fixed prices compared to  when commodity prices were much higher than the fixed prices of our contracts 
the changes in partnership general and administrative cash payments primarily result from the timing differences in settlements between us and the partnership  especially those related to allocations of incentive and long term compensation programs and insurance  which  for the most part  the partnership does not fund until targa makes payments to participants or providers

a significant portion of the cost of constructing new gathering lines to connect to the partnership s gathering system is generally paid for by the natural gas producer 
however  the partnership expects to make significant expenditures during the next year for the construction of additional natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure and the expansion of its logistics assets 
we categorize capital expenditures as either i maintenance expenditures or ii expansion expenditures 
maintenance capital expenditures are those expenditures that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets including the replacement of system components and equipment which is worn  obsolete or completing its useful life  the addition of new sources of natural gas supply to our systems to replace natural gas production declines and expenditures to remain in compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
expansion capital expenditures improve the service capability of the existing assets  extend asset useful lives  increase capacities from existing levels  add capabilities  reduce costs or enhance revenues  and fund acquisitions of businesses or assets

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain 
see the description of our accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements for additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates 
property  plant and equipment 
in general  depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset s cost  less its residual value if any  to the period it benefits 
our property  plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
our estimate of depreciation incorporates assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets 
at the time we place our assets in service  we believe such assumptions are reasonable  however  circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions  which would change our depreciation amounts prospectively 
examples of such circumstances include changes in energy prices  changes in competition  changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset changes in technology that render an asset obsolete  changes in expected salvage values  and changes in the forecast life of applicable resources basins 
as of december   the net book value of our property  plant and equipment was billion and we recorded million in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  the weighted average life of our long lived assets is approximately years 
if the useful lives of these assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation expense may increase  liabilities for future asset retirement obligations may be insufficient and impairments in carrying values of tangible and intangible assets may result 
for example  if the depreciable lives of our assets were reduced by  we estimate that depreciation expense would increase by million per year  which would result in a corresponding reduction in our operating income 
in addition  if an assessment of impairment resulted in a reduction of of our long lived assets  our operating income would decrease by million in the year of the impairment 
there have been no material changes impacting estimated useful lives of the assets 
revenue recognition 
as of december   our balance sheet reflects total accounts receivable from third parties of million 
we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  of million 
the partnership s exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable relates to the financial health of its counterparties 
we have an active credit management process which is focused on controlling loss exposure to bankruptcies or other liquidity issues of counterparties 
if an assessment of uncollectible accounts resulted in a reduction of the partnership s third party accounts receivable  annual operating income would decrease by million in the year of the assessment 
price risk management hedging 
the partnership s net income and cash flows are subject to volatility stemming from changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
to reduce the volatility of our cash flows  the partnership has entered into derivative financial instruments related to a portion of its equity volumes to manage the purchase and sales prices of commodities 
we are exposed to the credit risk of the partnership s counterparties in these derivative financial instruments 
we also monitor ngl inventory levels with a view to mitigating losses related to downward price exposure 

table of contents the partnership s cash flow is affected by the derivative financial instruments it enters into to the extent these instruments are settled by i making or receiving a payment to from the counterparty or ii making or receiving a payment for entering into a contract that exactly offsets the original derivative financial instrument 
typically a derivative financial instrument is settled when the physical transaction that underlies the derivative financial instrument occurs 
one of the primary factors that can affect the partnership s operating results each period is the price assumptions used to value the partnership s derivative financial instruments  which are reflected at their fair values in the balance sheet 
the relationship between the derivative financial instruments and the hedged item must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the derivative financial instrument and on an ongoing basis 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when a derivative financial instrument becomes ineffective 
gains and losses deferred in other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting has been discontinued remain deferred until the forecasted transaction occurs 
if it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the derivative financial instrument are reclassified to earnings immediately 
the estimated fair value of the partnership s derivative financial instruments was a net liability of million as of december   net of an adjustment for credit risk 
the credit risk adjustment is based on the default probabilities by year as indicated by the counterparties credit default swap transactions 
these default probabilities have been applied to the unadjusted fair values of the derivative financial instruments to arrive at the credit risk adjustment  which aggregates to million as of december  the partnership has an active credit management process which is focused on controlling loss exposure to bankruptcies or other liquidity issues of counterparties 
if a financial instrument counterparty were to declare bankruptcy  we and the partnership would be exposed to the loss of fair value of the financial instrument transaction with that counterparty 
ignoring the adjustment for credit risk  if a bankruptcy by a financial instrument counterparty impacted of the fair value of commodity based financial instruments that are in an asset position  we estimate that the partnership s operating income would decrease by million in the year of the bankruptcy 
use of estimates 
when preparing financial statements in conformity with gaap  management must make estimates and assumptions based on information available at the time 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
estimates and judgments are based on information available at the time such estimates and judgments are made 
adjustments made with respect to the use of these estimates and judgments often relate to information not previously available 
uncertainties with respect to such estimates and judgments are inherent in the preparation of financial statements 
estimates and judgments are used in  among other things  estimating unbilled revenues  product purchases and operating and general and administrative costs  developing fair value assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates  analyzing long lived assets for possible impairment  estimating the useful lives of assets and determining amounts to accrue for contingencies  guarantees and indemnifications 
actual results  therefore  could differ materially from estimated amounts

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the partnership s principal market risks are its exposure to changes in commodity prices  particularly to the prices of natural gas and ngls  changes in interest rates  as well as nonperformance by its customers 
neither we nor the partnership use risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
commodity price risk 
a majority of the partnership s revenues are derived from percent of proceeds contracts under which it receives a portion of the natural gas and or ngl equity volumes as payment for services 
the prices of natural gas and ngls are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond the partnership s control 
the partnership monitors these risks and enters into hedging transactions designed to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations on its business 
cash flows from a derivative instrument designated as a hedge are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the item being hedged 
the primary purpose of the commodity risk management activities is to hedge the exposure to commodity price risk and reduce fluctuations in the partnership s operating cash flow despite fluctuations in commodity prices 
in an effort to reduce the variability of the partnership s cash flows  as of december   the partnership has hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of its expected natural gas  ngl and condensate equity volumes that result from its percent of proceeds processing arrangements in field gathering and processing  and the lou portion of the coastal gathering and processing operations through by entering into derivative financial instruments including swaps and purchased puts or floors 
the percentages of expected equity volumes that are hedged decrease over time 
with swaps  the partnership typically receives an agreed fixed price for a specified notional quantity of natural gas or ngl and it pays the hedge counterparty a floating price for that same quantity based upon published index prices 
since the partnership receives from its customers substantially the same floating index price from the sale of the underlying physical commodity  these transactions are designed to effectively lock in the agreed fixed price in advance for the volumes hedged 
in order to avoid having a greater volume hedged than its actual equity volumes  the partnership typically limits its use of swaps to hedge the prices of less than its expected natural gas and ngl equity volumes 
the partnership utilizes purchased puts or floors to hedge additional expected equity commodity volumes without creating volumetric risk 
the partnership intends to continue to manage its exposure to commodity prices in the future by entering into similar derivative transactions using swaps  collars  purchased puts or floors or other derivative instruments as market conditions permit 
the partnership has tailored its hedges to generally match the ngl product composition and the ngl and natural gas delivery points to those of its physical equity volumes 
the ngl hedges cover specific ngl products based upon the expected equity ngl composition 
the partnership believes this strategy avoids uncorrelated risks resulting from employing hedges on crude oil or other petroleum products as proxy hedges of ngl prices 
the ngl hedges fair values are based on published index prices for delivery at mont belvieu through the natural gas hedges fair values are based on published index prices for delivery at various locations which closely approximate the actual ngl and natural gas delivery points 
a portion of the partnership s condensate sales are hedged using crude oil hedges that are based on the nymex futures contracts for west texas intermediate light  sweet crude 
these commodity price hedging transactions are typically documented pursuant to a standard international swap dealers association form with customized credit and legal terms 
the principal counterparties or  if applicable  their guarantors have investment grade credit ratings 
the partnership s payment obligations in connection with substantially all of these hedging transactions and any additional credit exposure due to a rise in natural gas and ngl prices relative to the fixed prices set forth in the hedges are currently secured by a first priority lien in the collateral securing its senior secured indebtedness that ranks equal in right of payment with liens granted in favor of its senior secured lenders 
absent federal regulations requiring the deposit of cash collateral resulting from the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  and as long as this first priority lien is in effect  the partnership expects to have no obligation to post cash  letters of credit or other additional collateral to secure these hedges at any time  even if a counterparty s exposure to the partnership s credit increases over the term of the hedge as a result of higher commodity prices or because there has been a change in the partnership s creditworthiness 
a purchased put or floor transaction does not expose the partnership s counterparties to credit risk  as the partnership has no obligation to make future payments beyond the premium paid to enter into the transaction 
the partnership is exposed to the risk of default by the counterparty  which is the risk that the counterparty will not honor its obligation under the put transaction 
for all periods presented  the partnership has entered into hedging arrangements for a portion of its forecasted equity volumes 
floor volumes and floor pricing are based solely on purchased puts or floors 
during the years ended december   and  our consolidated operating revenues were increased decreased by net hedge adjustments on commodity derivative contracts of million  million and million 
the net hedge adjustments that impact our consolidated revenues but do not affect the partnership s revenues include amortization of other comprehensive income oci related to hedges terminated and re assigned upon the partnership s acquisition of versado in  as well as oci related to terminations of commodity derivatives in july 
table of contents as of december   the partnership had the following hedge arrangements which will settle during the years ending december  through natural gas instrument price mmbtu per day type index mmbtu fair value in millions swap if waha swap if waha total swaps swap if pb swap if pb total swaps swap if ngpl mc swap if ngpl mc total swaps total sales natural gas basis swaps basis swaps various indexes  maturities through december ngl instrument price barrels per day type index gal fair value in millions swap opis mb swap opis mb total swaps floor opis mb cap opis mb total floors total sales condensate instrument price barrels per day type index bbl fair value in millions swap ny wti swap ny wti swap ny wti total sales 
table of contents these contracts may expose the partnership to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances 
its hedging arrangements provide protection on the hedged volumes if prices decline below the prices at which these hedges are set 
if prices rise above the prices at which they have been hedged  the partnership will receive less revenue on the hedged volumes than it would receive in the absence of hedges 
the partnership accounts for the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities using a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the significant inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
the value of the ngl derivative contracts is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow model for swaps and a standard option pricing model for options  based on inputs that are readily available in public markets 
for the ngl contracts that have inputs from quoted prices  the classification of these instruments is level within the fair value hierarchy 
for those ngl contracts which the partnership is unable to obtain quoted prices for at least of the full term of the commodity swap and options  the ngl valuations are classified as level within the fair value hierarchy 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report for more information regarding classifications within the fair value hierarchy 
interest rate risk 
we and the partnership are exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate changes due to our variable rate holdco loan facility 
the partnership is exposed to interest rate changes as a result of variable rate borrowings under the revolver of the partnership 
to the extent that interest rates increase  interest expense for our holdco loan facility and the partnership s revolving debt will also increase 
as of december   the partnership had variable rate borrowings of million  and we had variable rate borrowings of million 
a hypothetical change of basis points in the interest rate of variable rate debt would impact the partnership s annual interest expense by million and would impact the trc non partnership annual interest expense by million 
counterparty credit risk 
the partnership is subject to risk of losses resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by its counterparties 
the credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of the asset position ie the fair value of expected future receipts at the reporting date 
should the creditworthiness of one or more of the counterparties decline  the partnership s ability to mitigate nonperformance risk is limited to a counterparty agreeing to either a voluntary termination and subsequent cash settlement or a novation of the derivative contract to a third party 
in the event of a counterparty default  the partnership may sustain a loss and its cash receipts could be negatively impacted 
as of december   affiliates of barclays plc barclays  credit suisse ag credit suisse  natixis and jp morgan chase bank na jp morgan accounted for   and of the partnership s counterparty credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments 
barclays  credit suisse  natixis and jp morgan are major financial institutions that possess investment grade credit ratings based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by moody s investors service  inc and standard poor s corporation 
customer credit risk 
the partnership extends credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
the partnership has established various procedures to manage its credit exposure  including initial credit approvals  credit limits and terms  letters of credit and rights of offset 
the partnership also uses prepayments and guarantees to limit credit risk to ensure that its established credit criteria are met
