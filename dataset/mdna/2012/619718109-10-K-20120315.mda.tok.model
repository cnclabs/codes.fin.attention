item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report 
overview our strategy and primary business objective is to become a fabless semiconductor company focused on the development and sale of bandwidth engine integrated circuits ics to networking equipment systems providers and their subsystem and component vendors 
our bandwidth engine family of ics combines our t sram high density embedded memory and high speed gigabits per second gbps serial interface i o technology with our intelligent access technology and a highly efficient interface protocol and is initially being marketed to networking systems companies 
bandwidth engine ics have been designed to increase system performance by using a serial i o to increase the accesses per second between the processor and memory components in networking systems 
since the beginning of  we have invested an increasing amount of our financial and engineering resources towards the development of our bandwidth engine family of ics 
we shipped initial samples of our first bandwidth engine ics to prospective customers in december  and  in november  we announced two design wins for low volume applications 
our future success and ability to achieve and maintain profitability will be dependent on our success in developing a market for our bandwidth engine ics 
historically  our primary business has been defining  designing  marketing and licensing differentiated embedded memory and high speed parallel and serial interface intellectual property ip for advanced systems on chip socs designs 
however  our competitiveness and the demand for our ip have declined since the beginning of as we have begun to dedicate more of our engineering and marketing resources to our ic efforts 
we expect that this trend will continue as we place more emphasis on ic product sales as opposed to our ip transactions 
the t sram is our high density  high performance patented memory solution that represents an alternative to traditional volatile embedded memory 
our i o ip includes physical layer phy circuitry that allows ics to communicate with one another in the networking  storage  computer and consumer market segments 
our phy ip supports serial interface technologies  such as gbps base kr  xaui  pci express and sata  as well as parallel interfaces like ddr our ip customers typically include fabless semiconductor companies  integrated device manufacturers idms and foundries 
as a result of our reduced licensing activities  we expect our licensing and royalty revenue to decrease in future periods 
we do not expect to generate significant revenue from our bandwidth engine ics until the second half of or later  and we believe that the growth in our ic revenues will not offset the decline in our ip revenues until at least accordingly  we expect our losses from operations to increase in the near future 
sources of revenue we currently generate two types of ip revenue licensing and royalties 
licensing 
licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements  development services  prepaid pre production royalties  and support and maintenance 
our license agreements involve long sales cycles  which make it difficult to predict when the agreements will be signed 
in addition  our licensing revenue fluctuates from period to period  and it is difficult for us to predict the timing and magnitude of such revenue from quarter to quarter 
moreover  we believe that the amount of licensing revenue for any period is not necessarily indicative of results in any future period 

table of contents our licensing revenue consists primarily of fees for providing circuit design  layout and design verification and granting licenses to customers that embed our technology into their products 
license fees generally range from  to several million dollars per contract  depending on the scope and complexity of the development project  and the extent of the licensee s rights 
the vast majority of our contracts allow for milestone billing based on work performed 
fees billed prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
royalty 
royalty revenue represents amounts earned under provisions in our memory licensing contracts that require our licensees to report royalties and make payments at a stated rate based on actual units manufactured or sold by licensees for products that include our memory ip 
we recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee s report 
royalty bearing license agreements provide for royalty payments at a stated rate 
we negotiate royalty rates by taking into account such factors as the anticipated volume of the licensee s sales of products utilizing our technologies and the cost savings to be achieved by the licensee through the use of our technology 
our license agreements require the licensee to report the manufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs 
as with our licensing revenue  the timing and level of royalties are difficult to predict 
they depend on the licensee s ability to market  produce and sell products incorporating our technology 
many of the products of our licensees that are currently subject to licenses from us are used in consumer products  such as electronic game consoles  for which demand can be seasonal 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the accounting policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
these policies may involve estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual future results may differ from our estimates  and if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
revenue recognition general we generate revenue from the licensing of our ip  and customers pay fees for licensing  development services  royalties and maintenance and support 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of signed agreements 
when sales arrangements contain multiple elements eg  license and services  we review each element to determine the separate units of accounting that exist within the agreement 
if more than one unit of accounting exists  the consideration payable to us under the agreement is allocated to each unit of accounting using the relative fair value method 
revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that unit of accounting 

table of contents licensing licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements  development services and support and maintenance 
for stand alone license agreements or license deliverables in multi deliverable arrangements that do not require significant development  modification or customization  revenue is recognized when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
delivery of the licensed technology is typically the final revenue recognition criterion met  at which time revenue is recognized 
if any of the criteria are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until such time as all criteria have been met 
for license agreements that include deliverables requiring significant production  modification or customization  and where we have significant experience in meeting the design specifications involved in the contract and the direct labor hours related to services under the contract can be reasonably estimated  we recognize revenue over the period in which the contract services are performed 
for these arrangements  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress 
significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours 
these judgmental elements include determining that we have the experience to meet the design specifications and estimating the total direct labor hours 
we follow this method because we can obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the direct labor hours to perform the contract services 
the direct labor hours for the development of the licensee s design are estimated at the beginning of the contract 
as these direct labor hours are incurred  they are used as a measure of progress towards completion 
we have the ability to reasonably estimate the direct labor hours on a contract by contract basis based on our experience in developing prior licensees designs 
during the contract performance period  we review estimates of direct labor hours to complete the contracts as the contract progresses to completion and will revise our estimates of revenue and gross profit under the contract if we revise the estimations of the direct labor hours to complete 
our policy is to reflect any revision in the contract gross profit estimate in reported income or loss in the period in which the facts giving rise to the revision become known 
under the percentage of completion method  provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses are determined to be likely 
if the amount of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion accounting method exceeds the amount of billings to a customer  then the excess amount is recorded as an unbilled contracts receivable 
we provide support and maintenance under many of our license agreements 
under these arrangements  we provide unspecified upgrades  design rule changes and technical support 
no other upgrades  products or other post contract support are provided 
support and maintenance revenue is recognized at its fair value established by vendor specific objective evidence  ratably over the period during which the obligation exists  typically months 
these arrangements are generally renewable annually by the customer 
under limited circumstances  we also recognize prepaid pre production royalties as license revenue 
these are lump sum payments made when we enter into licensing agreements that cover future shipments of a product that is not commercially available from the licensee 
we characterize such payments as license revenue because they are paid as part of the initial license fee and not with respect to products being produced by the licensee 
these payments are non cancelable and non refundable 
royalty our licensing contracts typically also provide for royalties based on licensees use of our memory technology in their currently shipping commercial products 
we recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee s report 
under limited circumstances  we may also recognize prepaid post production royalties as revenue upon execution of the contract  which are paid in a lump sum 
table of contents after the licensee commences production of the royalty bearing product and applied against future unit shipments regardless of the actual level of shipments by the licensee 
the criteria for revenue recognition of prepaid royalties are that a formal agreement with the licensee is executed  no deliverables  development or support services related to prepaid royalties are required  the fees are non refundable and not contingent upon future product shipments by the licensee  and the fees are payable by the licensee in a time period consistent with our normal billing terms 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer revenue recognition until such time as all criteria have been met 
fair value measurements of financial instruments we measure the fair value of financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels  as follows level inputs used to measure fair value are unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date 
level pricing is provided by third party sources of market information obtained from investment advisors rather than models 
we do not adjust for or apply any additional assumptions or estimates to the pricing information we receive from advisors 
our level securities include cash equivalents and available for sale securities  which consisted primarily of corporate debt  and government agency and municipal debt securities from issuers with high quality credit ratings 
our investment advisors obtain pricing data from independent sources  such as standard poor s  bloomberg and interactive data corporation  and rely on comparable pricing of other securities because the level securities we hold are not actively traded and have fewer observable transactions 
we consider this the most reliable information available for the valuation of the securities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment are used to measure fair value 
these values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions 
the determination of fair value for level investments and other financial instruments involves the most management judgment and subjectivity 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when a triggering event is deemed to have occurred 
this assessment is subjective in nature and requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results  projected cash flows and current period market capitalization levels 
if our estimates and assumptions change in the future  it could result in a material write down of long lived assets 
we amortize our finite lived intangible assets  such as developed technology  patent license and workforce  on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of one to seven years 
we recognize an impairment charge as the difference between the net book value of such assets and the fair value of the assets on the measurement date 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we use a two step impairment test 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using the market approach 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired  and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the 
table of contents carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment charge equal to the difference 
we have determined that we have a single reporting unit for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment test 
as we use the market approach to assess impairment  the price of our common stock is an important component of the fair value calculation 
if our stock price continues to experience significant price and volume fluctuations  this will impact the fair value of the reporting unit  which can lead to potential impairment in future periods 
as of december   we had not identified any factors to indicate there was an impairment of our goodwill and determined that no additional impairment analysis was required 
deferred tax valuation allowance when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability for each of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets  which we show on our consolidated balance sheet under the category of other current assets 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon weighted available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation for equity awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  usually the vesting period  based on the grant date fair value 
we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price 
results of operations net revenue 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands licensing percentage of total net revenue licensing revenue decreased million in due to a decline in the number and value of new license agreements 
licensing revenue in included revenue recognized from the achievement of final milestones for two t sram technology license agreements executed in the fourth quarter of we expect our licensing revenue to decrease in as we will not be pursuing new ip licenses  and the company s sales and marketing personnel will be focusing on selling bandwidth engine ics 
the million increase in licensing revenue in compared with resulted primarily from increased licensing activity in the fourth quarter of involving license agreements that required significant customization 
consequently  revenue under those agreements was recognized in in 
table of contents accordance with our revenue recognition accounting policies 
we also signed a technology agreement with a major japanese idm customer in the second quarter of  which contributed to the revenue growth 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands royalty percentage of total net revenue royalty revenue decreased million in primarily due to a decrease in shipments by an idm licensee whose product is used in the nintendo wii game console  although we did experience an increase in royalties received from tsmc  a major foundry partner  and from another licensee due to higher manufacturing volumes for their products 
we expect royalty revenues to decrease in  primarily due to reduced shipments by the idm licensee  as the nintendo wii game console is expected to be replaced in by a new console that does not incorporate our technology 
royalty revenue increased million in primarily due to an increase in royalties received from tsmc  and a fabless semiconductor company resulting from higher manufacturing volumes for their products 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in shipments by an idm licensee whose product is used in the nintendo wii game console  as well as decreased royalties received from licensees with products incorporating older generation technologies  such as micron and micron fabrication processes  which are approaching end of product life 
cost of net revenue and gross profit 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands cost of net revenue percentage of total net revenue year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands gross profit percentage of total net revenue cost of net revenue consists of personnel costs for engineers assigned to revenue generating licensing arrangements and related overhead allocation costs 
direct labor hours are tracked for each licensing arrangements and are used to measure the progress of completion 
cost of net revenue increased in primarily due to two t sram projects that were substantially completed in the fourth quarter of in which we expensed million of previously capitalized deferred costs 
cost of net revenue in included stock based compensation expense of million  an increase of million compared with total gross profit decreased to million in primarily due to the lower margin contribution from the two t sram projects and the decrease in royalty revenues 
we expect that the cost of licensing revenue will decrease in absolute dollars in the future because we anticipate entering into fewer license agreements 
we expect cost as a percentage of total net revenue to increase as we begin to generate revenues more from the sale of ics rather than the licensing of ip 
the increase in cost of net revenue for compared with resulted primarily from an increase in the number of licensing contracts requiring customization 
cost of net revenue in included stock based compensation expense of million  which was consistent with the prior year 
total gross profit increased to million in primarily due to an increase in license and royalty revenues 

table of contents research and development 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands research and development percentage of total net revenue our research and development expenses include development and design of variations of our t sram and i o technologies for use in different manufacturing processes used by licensees  costs related to the development of the bandwidth engine ic and amortization of technology based intangible assets 
in  we incurred costs of million  related to our former analog mixed signal product lines  which we exited in late we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
the million increase in was primarily due to increases in license costs for our cad software tools  costs related to the development of our bandwidth engine ic and stock based compensation charges  offset by a decrease in acquisition related contingent compensation charges 
the million increase in was primarily due to our expanded engineering team working on our i o and bandwidth engine ic products  mask tooling and other fabrication costs  increased amortization costs related to acquired intangible assets and increased costs for our cad software tools 
research and development expenses included stock based compensation expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect that research and development expenses will remain flat or decrease slightly in absolute dollars  but will increase as a percentage of total revenue as our ip revenues decline faster than our ic revenues ramp 
the primary driver of research and development expense will be our continued investment in our current and next generation bandwidth engine ic products 
selling  general and administrative 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands selling  general and administrative percentage of total net revenue selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  application engineering  finance  human resources and general management 
the million decrease for was primarily due to a decrease in personnel related  acquisition related and consulting costs 
the million increase for was primarily due to an increase in legal  marketing and personnel related costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses included stock based compensation expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect total selling  general and administrative expenses to remain flat or slightly decrease in absolute dollars  but increase as a percentage of revenues as our ip revenues decline faster than our ic revenues ramp 

table of contents gain on sale of patents 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands gain on sale of patents percentage of total net revenue in december  we entered into a patent purchase agreement for the sale of united states and related foreign memory technology patents for million in cash 
we recognized a million gain on this transaction  which has been recorded as a reduction of operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the gain was comprised of the million of proceeds  plus million  which we determined to be the value of our retained license to these patents  net of transaction costs 
other income and expense  net 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands other income and expense  net percentage of total net revenue other income and expense  net primarily consisted of interest income on our investments  which was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income declined by million in and million in primarily due to lower average investment balances and lower interest rates earned 
income tax provision benefit 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands income tax provision benefit percentage of total net revenue our income tax provision was attributable to the federal alternative minimum tax  as we were profitable in  and foreign jurisdictions 
our income tax provision was primarily attributable to foreign jurisdictions 
our income tax benefit was primarily attributable to us federal refundable tax credits 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for us federal income tax purposes and approximately million for state income tax purposes that are available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal and state income tax laws 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards expire from to  and state net operating loss carryforwards expire from to in  we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will continue to be less than the federal statutory tax rate because of expected losses 
as of december  and  we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
because of uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets  we had recorded a full valuation allowance as of december  and 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million compared with a combined balance of million at december  our principal source of cash in was the sale of patents for million in december in december  we sold approximately million shares of common stock in a registered direct equity offering  raising approximately million  net of transaction expenses of approximately million 
the offering was made under our existing million shelf registration statement that became effective in november our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital  including development of bandwidth engine ics  and any acquisitions that we make that require cash consideration or expenditures 
in  we used million in operating activities  which primarily resulted from the net income of million and million generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities  reduced by the million gain on the sale of patents and adjusted for non cash charges consisting of stock based compensation of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
the changes in assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of billing our customers  collection of receivables and payments to vendors 
in  we used million in operating activities  which primarily resulted from the net loss of million  partially offset by non cash charges consisting of stock based compensation expense of million  depreciation and amortization of million and million generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the changes in assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of billing our customers  collection of receivables and payments to vendors 
in  we used net cash of million in operating activities 
primarily  that amount reflected the net effects of our net loss of million  adjusted for million generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of the acquisition of prism circuits  non cash charges  including stock based compensation expense of million  amortization of intangible assets of million  depreciation and amortization of million and a non cash restructuring charge of million 
the changes in assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of billing our customers  collection of receivables and payments to vendors 
additional cash uses in included the payment of million in deferred consideration for the magnalynx acquisition in and the purchase of million of fixed assets 
our investing activities in included business acquisition payments of million  of which million related to a contingent payment related to the acquisition of prism circuits and million related to the acquisition of magnalynx in the first quarter of in  we purchased million of fixed assets 
remaining investing activities consisted of investing our cash in marketable securities 
our investing activities in included a net payment of million for the acquisition of prism circuits and million for purchases of fixed assets during our financing activities in primarily consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
our cash from financing activities in consisted of the proceeds of our registered direct offering of common stock and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
cash used in financing activities in consisted of million used for stock repurchases under our repurchase program prior to its suspension in february our future liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter  depending on numerous factors  including level and timing of licensing  royalty and ic product revenue  
table of contents cost  timing and success of technology development efforts  including meeting customer design specifications  fabrication costs  including mask costs of our bandwidth engine ics  currently under development  variations in manufacturing yields  materials costs and other manufacturing risks  costs of acquiring other businesses and integrating the acquired operations  and profitability of our business 
we expect our cash expenditures to continue to exceed receipts in as we will generate minimal revenue from ic sales and expect reduced licensing and royalty revenues compared with  and we will continue our research and development efforts for the expansion and fabrication of the bandwidth engine ic product line 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  along with our existing capital and cash generated from operations  if any  to be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
should our cash resources prove inadequate  we may seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing  and have a shelf registration allowing us to sell up to approximately million of our securities from time to time until november we also might decide to raise additional capital at such times and upon such terms as management considers favorable and in our interests  including  but not limited to  from the sale of our debt and or equity securities under our existing shelf registration statement 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
the failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payment due by period total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase commitments capital leases as of december   we had purchase commitments of million for licenses related to computer aided design tools payable through january  million in other purchase commitments and million in capital lease obligations for testing equipment 
in july  we entered into a year operating lease agreement for approximately  square feet with mission west properties  inc for our corporate headquarters in santa clara  california 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements or obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the counter party from losses relating to a breach of representations and warranties  
table of contents a failure to perform certain covenants  or claims and losses arising from certain external events as outlined within the particular contract  which may include  for example  losses arising from litigation or claims relating to past performance 
such indemnification clauses may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
we have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors 
no material amounts are reflected in our consolidated financial statements for  or related to these indemnifications 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk due to our investment portfolio 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and meet liquidity needs 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including us government agency debt  municipal notes  corporate notes and bonds  and money market funds 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer or fund 
the investments  other than money market funds  are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
securities with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents 
securities with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short term investments 
securities with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long term investments 
all investments have a maturity of less than two years 
no single security should exceed of the portfolio at the time of purchase 
the portfolio s dollar weighted average maturity of investments is within months 
these securities  which approximated million as of december  and earned an average annual interest rate of approximately in  are subject to interest rate and credit risks 
as of december   we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio 
according to our analysis  parallel shifts in the yield curve of both would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately million 
we do not have any investments denominated in foreign currencies  and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk currently  all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains or losses to date 
however  the expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in their local currencies  therefore we have risk of foreign exchange gains and losses through the funding of those expenditures 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases  we may choose to hedge those exposures 
for most currencies  we are a net payer of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a stronger us dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker us dollar relative to those foreign currencies
