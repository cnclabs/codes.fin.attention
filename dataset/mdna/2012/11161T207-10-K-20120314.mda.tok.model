item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion below contains forward looking statements  as defined in section e of the exchange act  that reflect our current expectations regarding our future growth  results of operations  cash flows  performance and business prospects and opportunities  as well as assumptions made by  and information currently available to  our management 
we have tried to identify forward looking statements by using words such as anticipate  believe  plan  expect  intend  will  and similar expressions  but these words are not the exclusive means of identifying forward looking statements 
these statements are based on information currently available to us and are subject to various risks  uncertainties  and other factors  including  but not limited to  those matters discussed in item a risk factors in part i of this annual report on form k  that could cause our actual growth  results of operations  cash flows  performance and business prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these statements 
except as expressly required by the federal securities laws  we undertake no obligation to update such factors or to publicly announce the results of any of the forward looking statements contained herein to reflect future events  developments  or changed circumstances  or for any other reason 
as used in this annual report on form k  the terms we  us  our  broadwind  broadwind energy and the company refer to broadwind energy  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
dollars are presented in thousands unless otherwise stated business overview broadwind provides technologically advanced high value products and services to energy  mining and infrastructure sector customers  primarily in the us our most significant presence is within the us wind industry  although we have increasingly diversified into other industrial markets in order to improve our capacity utilization and reduce our exposure to uncertainty related to the extension or renewal of tax incentives and other favorable policies currently supporting the us wind industry 
our product and service portfolio provides our wind energy customers  including wind turbine manufacturers  wind farm developers and wind farm operators  with access to a broad array of component and service offerings 
outside of the wind market  we provide precision gearing and specialty weldments to a broad range of industrial customers for oil and gas  mining and other industrial applications 
the market for new us wind energy installations is affected by the following factors i economic growth and the associated demand for new electricity generation  ii the cost of competing alternatives to conventional energy sources  primarily natural gas  iii federal and state level wind development incentives  iv upgrades to existing transmission infrastructure and the proliferation of smart grid technology  and v improvements in wind energy cost competitiveness resulting from the maturation of technologies and services within the wind industry  including increased turbine efficiencies  and improved focus on equipment maintenance and reliability 
in  approximately of our sales were associated with new wind turbine manufacturing and installations and were related to servicing the installed fleet of wind turbines 
the remaining of our sales primarily consisted of gearing and specialty weldments for industrial customers 
during this time we continued to execute our diversification strategy for our operations focusing on increasing sales to industrial customers within our gearing segment 
of our total company backlog at the end of  represents industrial customer demand  which is up from in while we believe that we will continue to have sufficient cash flows to operate our business and meet our financial debt covenants  there can be no assurances that our operations will generate sufficient cash or that credit facilities will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our 
table of contents indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if assumptions regarding our restructuring efforts which are described in greater detail below  sales and subsequent collections from several of our large customers  as well as revenues generated from new customer orders  are not materially consistent with management s expectations  we may encounter cash flow and liquidity issues 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us  which could affect our overall operations 
any additional equity financing  if available  may be dilutive to stockholders  and additional debt financing  if available  will likely require financial covenants or other restrictions 
additionally  we have a limited number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under our certificate of incorporation following our recent common stock offering 
as such  our ability to raise capital through future equity issuances may be restricted unless we increase the number of authorized shares of common stock  which would require the approval of a majority of the holders of our outstanding shares 
during the third quarter of  we conducted a review of our business strategies and product plans given the outlook for the economy at large  the forecast for the industries we serve  and our own business environment 
as a result  we have begun to execute a restructuring plan to rationalize our facility capacity and our management structure  and to consolidate and increase the efficiencies of our operations 
we have concluded that our manufacturing footprint and fixed cost base are too large and expensive for our medium term needs 
we are planning to reduce our facility footprint by approximately through the sale and or closure during the next fifteen months of facilities comprising a total of approximately  square feet 
the most significant planned reductions consist of one of our cicero  illinois gearing facilities and our non operational brandon  south dakota tower manufacturing facility 
we believe the remaining locations will be sufficient to support our towers and weldments  gearing  services and general corporate and administrative activities while allowing for growth for the next several years 
these factors have required management to reassess its estimates of the fair value of some of our reportable segments and could result in further review of our intangible assets and fixed assets 
we expect to incur restructuring costs associated with the restructuring plan totaling an estimated  of which has been incurred through the end of costs are expected to include approximately  in capital expenditures and  in expenses  of which approximately  is anticipated to be non cash expenses and  is anticipated to be cash expenses 
net proceeds from associated asset sales  projected to be approximately  will be used to fund cash costs 
we anticipate annual savings going forward of approximately  related to the restructuring 
in connection with our december decision to divest our badger transport  inc subsidiary badger  which formerly comprised our logistics segment  we classified badger as a discontinued operation 
the assets and liabilities of badger were classified as assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  in connection with the reclassification to assets held for sale  in we recorded an impairment charge of  to write down the assets to their net realizable value 
the impairment charge was included in loss from discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december

our gearing segment total revenues increased by as increases in industrial gearing revenue more than offset the declines in wind revenue  consistent with our focus on diversifying our business 
revenues in our services segment increased by due to increased blade services to our two largest customers  as well as the initial 
table of contents sales of gearboxes and loose gearing in connection with our abilene  texas drivetrain service center facility which opened in february total gross profit increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the gross margin percentage rose from in to in the improvement was primarily attributable to increased tower and gearing sales volumes and a higher margin mix of gearing sales 
partly offsetting the increase were the impact of more competitive pricing within towers and weldments  and higher facility costs within services due to the start up of our abilene drivetrain service center facility which operated at a low utilization level during selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from  during the year ended december   to  during the year ended december   as a reduction in employee compensation costs was partially offset by  in increased legal costs 
we review our goodwill balances for impairment on at least an annual basis and review our intangible and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying value amount may not be recoverable 
during the second quarter of we identified a triggering event associated with the continued deterioration in the financial performance within our services segment 
this triggering event required a revision of our projection of future operating results and cash flows for this segment in light of the continued economic weakness in the wind energy industry 
we performed our review of goodwill based on the carrying value of these assets as of june   and the estimate of fair value for each of our operating segments was based primarily on projected future results  cash flows and other assumptions 
as a result of this review  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  at june  in our services segment 
during the fourth quarter of  we identified triggering events associated with our current period operating losses  our history of continued operating losses and our revised projections of operating results and cash flows developed as part of the strategic planning process 
as a result  our review of other long lived assets indicated that the carrying values of customer relationships  trade name and property and equipment within our services segment were also impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge during the fourth quarter of  in addition  following our strategic planning meetings that took place in the fourth quarter  we determined that our brandon  south dakota tower manufacturing facility was impaired and recorded an impairment charge to fixed assets of  during  we identified triggering events associated with our current period operating losses combined with our history of continued operating losses 
as a result  we evaluated the recoverability of certain of our identifiable intangible assets and certain property and equipment assets 
we did not record any corresponding impairment in intangible amortization expense decreased from  during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the decrease was due to a lower asset base because of the impairment charges noted above 
we recorded restructuring costs of in selling  general and administrative expenses in  primarily due to the closure of our european sales office and subsidiary 
we also recorded in other restructuring costs related primarily to losses on the sale of surplus equipment 
total other income  net  was an expense of during the year ended december   compared to other expense  net  of during the year ended december  the net improvement was a result of increased grant income associated with local economic development initiatives partially offset by the restructuring costs mentioned above

table of contents gearing segment revenues increased  from  during the year ended december   to  during the year ended december  the increase in industrial gearing revenue of more than offset the decline in wind revenue of  consistent with our strategic diversification focus 
the challenges in the wind industry depressed the manufacture of wind turbine gearing  which had typically accounted for the majority of our gearing revenues in the recent past 
in  as demand for wind gearing decreased  we increased our sales force and shifted our focus to the manufacture of custom engineered gearing systems and gearboxes for oil and gas  mining and other industrial customers 
gearing sales to oil and gas  mining and other industrial customers in represented of our total revenues  and orders from these customers represented of our backlog as of december  gearing segment operating loss improved by  from  during the year ended december   to  during the year ended december  the operating margin improvement is due to improved sales volume and mix  partially offset by higher legal expenses of  as well as additional selling costs

table of contents consolidated total revenues decreased  or  from  during the year ended december   to  during the year ended december  the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to an decline in our towers and weldments segment revenue due mainly to a reduction in the price of the steel component included in the overall tower section price compared to the prior year 
our gearing segment experienced decreases in wind and industrial gearing revenues of and  respectively  due primarily to reduced or delayed production orders in from key customers 
revenues in our services segment decreased due to the absence of a large blade program completed in  and an overall reduction in technical services provided in total cost of sales decreased  or  from  during the year ended december   to  during the year ended december  the decrease in cost of sales within our towers and weldments segment was primarily attributable to the decline in revenues as compared to the prior year  as well as the absence of start up and production costs for our new wind tower manufacturing facility in abilene  texas in the decrease in cost of sales within our gearing segment was primarily due to the decline in revenues compared to the prior year as well as enhanced production efficiencies during the second half of the decrease in cost of sales in our services segment was due to lower direct labor costs for field technicians as a result of the decline in revenues compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from  during the year ended december   to  during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to cost reduction initiatives  namely the reduction of third party professional fees  implemented during to mitigate the effects of an overall decline in production volumes  the absence of charges incurred in associated with amendments to our credit agreement with bank of america and reserves established in connection with a customer dispute in we review our goodwill balances for impairment on at least an annual basis and review our intangible and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying value amount may not be recoverable

our analysis also indicated impairment to our customer relationship and trade name intangible assets in our towers and weldments segment as a result of the merger of our industrial weldment business into our towers and weldments segment in december  and due to a revision in projected revenues and cash flows 
table of contents associated with these customer relationships 
accordingly  we recorded goodwill and intangible impairment charges of  and  respectively  to properly reflect the carrying value of these assets 
intangible amortization expense decreased from  during the year ended december   to  during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a  reduction in amortization expense in our gearing segment as a result of the impairment in to its customer relationship intangibles

towers and weldments segment operating loss increased by  from a loss of during the year ended december   to a loss of  during the year ended december  the increased loss from operations was primarily attributable to a fixed asset impairment charge of  related to our investment in the brandon  south dakota tower facility 
additionally  a less profitable sales mix resulted in margin degradation of  as well as in higher labor costs mainly associated with premium costs and inefficiencies that were incurred to support the increased production 
table of contents volume during the fourth quarter 
these items were partially offset by the absence of  of start up costs incurred in associated with our wind tower manufacturing facility in abilene  texas and a non recurring impairment charge with respect to a customer relationship and trade name intangible in the aggregate amount of  taken in towers and weldments operating margins deteriorated from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december   as a result of these factors

the manufacture of wind turbine gearing  which typically accounts for the majority of our gearing revenues  continued to be negatively affected by reduced or delayed production orders from our key gearing customers  predominantly in the first half of the year  as well as ongoing challenges in the wind industry 
gearing segment operating loss decreased by  from  during the year ended december   to  during the year ended december  the decrease in operating loss was largely attributable to the absence of impairment charges of  recorded during as a result of the impairment recorded  the corresponding amortization expense decreased by approximately  in compared to these two factors were partially offset by the establishment of an environmental reserve of approximately in gearing operating margin was during the year ended december  compared to during the year ended december   due to these factors

services segment operating loss increased  from during the year ended december   to  during the year ended december  the operating margin declined from in to in the deterioration in operating loss and operating margin were primarily attributable to the  adverse effect of reduced sales  a goodwill impairment charge of  recorded in the second quarter of  an impairment charge of  related to customer relationships  trade name and property and equipment taken in fourth quarter of  less favorable labor utilization during the first half of the year and start up costs related to our drivetrain service center in abilene  texas 
corporate and other corporate and other operating loss decreased  from  during the year ended december   to  during the year ended december  the decrease in operating loss was primarily attributable to a  reduction in professional fees associated with tax  accounting and legal services  as well as the absence of costs associated with an acquisition we did not complete during in addition  the decrease in operating loss was attributable to the absence of a  expense related to a customer dispute incurred in summary of critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have identified the accounting policies listed below to be critical to obtain an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
this section should also be read in conjunction with note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies in part iv  item in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these and other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete and when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  transfer of title has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred per the terms of the contract 
customer deposits and other receipts are deferred and recognized when the revenue is realized and earned 
in some instances  typically within our towers and weldments segment  products are sold under terms included in bill and hold sales arrangements that result in different timing for revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue under these arrangements only when the buyer requests the bill and hold arrangement  a fixed schedule for delivery exists  the ordered goods are segregated from inventory and not available to fill other orders and the goods are complete and ready for shipment 
assuming these required revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue is recognized upon completion of product manufacture and customer acceptance 
warranty liability we provide warranty terms that generally range from one to seven years for various products and services relating to workmanship and materials supplied by us 
in certain contracts  we have recourse 
table of contents provisions for items that would enable recovery from third parties for amounts paid to customers under warranty provisions 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we have recorded a reserve for excess of cost over market value in our inventory allowance 
market value of inventory  and management s judgment of the need for reserves  encompasses consideration of other business factors including physical condition  inventory holding period  contract terms  and usefulness 
inventories are valued based on an average cost method  which approximates the first in  first out fifo basis 
inventories consist of raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
raw materials consist of components and parts for general production use 
work in process consists of labor and overhead  processing costs  purchased subcomponents  and materials purchased for specific customer orders 
finished goods consist of components purchased from third parties as well as components manufactured by us that will be used to produce final customer products 
intangible assets we test intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our assets may not be recovered 
in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units 
recoverability is measured by comparing the assets carrying amounts to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to intangible assets 
long lived assets we review property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  we will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
in evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of such assets 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to property and equipment and other long lived assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes based upon an asset and liability approach 
deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities versus the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
under this method  deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the impact of tax rate changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year that the change is enacted 

table of contents in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize the expected future income tax benefits of net operating loss carryforwards as deferred income tax assets 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred income tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards  we consider  among other things  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future income tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
we also account for the uncertainty in income taxes related to the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
we follow the applicable pronouncement guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition related to the uncertainty in these income tax positions 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses asu 
asu requires increased disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and allowances for credit losses  including disclosures about credit quality indicators  past due information and modifications of financing receivables 
we have adopted this standard as of january  and it had no material impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity  financial position and capital resources at december   cash assets totaled  compared to our cash assets which totaled  at december  on september   we completed a public offering of our common stock  par value per share  at an offering price of per share 
in the offering  we sold  newly issued shares of our common stock for approximately  in proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts  but before deducting other offering related costs 
the proceeds will be used for general operating purposes 
we feel that we have adequate internal and external cash resources to meet current and future operating requirements 
our most relevant internal metric to analyze our liquidity is operating working capital  which is comprised of accounts receivable and inventories  net of accounts payable and customer deposits 
our operating working capital at december  was  or of trailing three months of sales annualized 
this is an increase of  from december   when operating working capital was  or of trailing three months of sales annualized 
we anticipate our working capital needs to continue to grow in the future based on the transactional structural changes of raw material steel purchasing pursuant to orders for our towers and weldments segment  which remains our largest potential use of working capital

additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us  which could affect our overall operations 
any additional equity financing  if available  may be dilutive to stockholders  and additional debt financing  if available  will likely require financial covenants or other restrictions 
additionally  we have a limited number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under our certificate of incorporation following our recent common stock offering 
as such  our ability to raise capital through future equity issuances may be restricted unless we increase the number of authorized shares of common stock  which would require the approval of a majority of the holders of our outstanding shares 
sources and uses of cash operating cash flows during the year ended december   net cash flows used in operating activities totaled  compared to net cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in operating activities as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to increases in our inventory and accounts receivable balances  along with a decrease in our accounts payable 
partially offsetting this increase was an increase in our customer deposits  and reduced loss from operations 
the loss from operations was  lower than the prior year loss exclusive of prior year impairment charges 

table of contents investing cash flows during the years ended december  and  net cash used in investing activities totaled  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to a reduction in capital expenditures and the sale of excess equipment in financing cash flows during the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities totaled  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities as compared to the prior year was attributable to larger proceeds from an equity offering of  completed in january  compared to proceeds from an equity offering of  completed in september partially offsetting the decrease associated with the reduced proceeds from the equity offerings  were lower payments on lines of credit and notes payable of  in versus  in  due to the reduction of our outstanding debt balances during and credit facilities investors community bank loans on april   rba executed four promissory notes in favor of investors community bank icb in the aggregate principal amount of approximately  three of these promissory notes were term notes  with initial principal balances totaling  bearing interest at fixed rates ranging from to per annum  with maturities ranging from october to april collectively  the icb notes 
the fourth promissory note was a line of credit note  which has been repaid in full 
pursuant to the merger of rba into broadwind towers on december   the loans evidenced by the icb notes collectively  the icb loans were modified pursuant to a master amendment among icb  broadwind towers and the company as guarantor the master amendment 
under the terms of the master amendment  broadwind towers agreed to a number of security and financial covenants 
as the outstanding balances under the icb loans have declined  certain of these requirements have been removed through subsequent amendments to the master amendment 
the remaining security requirements are that broadwind towers maintain a depository relationship of not less than with icb and maintain a debt service ratio of not less than to at all times 
the icb loans are also secured by a mortgage on a facility owned by broadwind towers in clintonville  wisconsin  and a guaranty by the company 
as of december   i the total amount of outstanding indebtedness under the icb notes was  ii the effective per annum interest rate under the icb notes was  and iii broadwind towers was in compliance with all covenants under the documents evidencing and securing the icb loans

the primary raw material we use is steel 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations  we have incorporated price adjustment clauses in certain sales contracts 
management believes a hypothetical change in the price of steel and other raw materials would not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows because these costs are generally passed through to our customers
