item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust 
we acquire  own and manage a geographically diversified portfolio of retail including furniture and office supply stores  industrial  office  flex  health and fitness and other properties  a substantial portion of which are under long term net leases 
as of december   we owned properties  one of which is vacant  and one of which is a tenancy in common interest 
our joint ventures owned a total of five properties 
the properties are located in states 

table of contents we face a variety of risks and challenges in our business 
as more fully described under item a risk factors  we  among other things  face the possibility we will not be able to lease our properties on terms favorable to us or at all and that our tenants may not be able to pay their rental and other obligations owing under their leases 
in particular  during the recent national economic recession  consumer confidence and retail spending declined  which negatively impacted certain of our retail tenants 
as a result  from through march  four of our retail tenants sought bankruptcy protection and several of our retail tenants obtained rent relief or negotiated lease renewals on financial terms more favorable to such tenants 
we seek to manage the risk of our real property portfolio by diversifying among types of properties and industries ie    and of our contractual rental income is derived from retail  industrial  office  and other properties  respectively  tenant identity no tenant accounts for more than of our contractual rental income  geography contractual rental income exceeds from properties in only two states  and lease expiration dates through  there are only two years in which the percentage of our contractual rental income represented by expiring leases exceeds of our contractual rental income and approximately of our contractual rental income is represented by leases expiring in and thereafter 
we monitor the risk of tenant non payments through a variety of approaches tailored to the applicable situation 
generally  based on our assessment of the credit risk posed by our tenants  we monitor a tenant s financial condition through one or more of the following actions reviewing tenant financial statements  obtaining other tenant related financial information  regular contact with tenant s representatives  tenant credit checks and regular management reviews of our tenants 
in acquiring properties  we balance an evaluation of the terms of the leases and the credit of the existing tenants with a fundamental analysis of the real estate to be acquired  which analysis takes into account  among other things  the estimated value of the property  local demographics and the ability to re rent or dispose of the property on favorable terms upon lease expiration or early termination 
in  we purchased six properties for an aggregate of million  sold one property tenanted by office depot for a net gain of  and issued million common shares and received net proceeds of approximately million which proceeds were used to  among other things  reduce the amount outstanding under our credit line by approximately million and repay mortgage debt of million with a weighted average interest rate of 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and total revenues the following table compares revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  increase decrease dollars in thousands change revenues total revenues total revenues 
the increase is attributable to rental revenues of million earned from substantially all of the properties acquired by us since february approximately million and  from properties acquired in and  respectively  and  of real estate tax and 
table of contents expense reimbursements from tenants 
partially offsetting the increase was the  net decrease of rental income from the property formerly tenanted by robb stucky  a furniture retailer that sought bankruptcy protection in february and the  decrease from lease amendments with tenants at two properties 
operating expenses the following table compares operating expenses for the periods indicated year ended december  increase decrease dollars in thousands change operating expenses depreciation and amortization general and administrative real estate acquisition costs real estate expenses leasehold rent total operating expenses operating income depreciation and amortization expense

general and administrative expenses 
the increase is attributable to several factors including i a  increase in the annual amount payable pursuant to the compensation and services agreement  ii a  annual fee paid to our vice chairman which fee commenced in  iii an increase  due to higher compensation rates  of  in payroll and payroll related expenses  and iv an increase of  in non cash compensation expense primarily related to pay for performance restricted stock units awarded in september partially offsetting the increase was the inclusion in of  in professional fees in connection with a contemplated equity financing that was not pursued 
real estate acquisition costs 
these expenses decreased due to the inclusion in of expenses related to more acquisitions than in real estate expenses 
approximately  of the increase is attributable to real estate taxes  of which  and  relate to properties we acquired in and  respectively

the decrease is attributable to our share of real estate acquisition costs incurred in connection with the purchase of a property in march and from the sale of a property in april at the time the related lease expired 
gain on disposition of real estate held by unconsolidated joint venture 
in  we recognized a net gain of  on the sale of a property owned by a joint venture 
there was no comparable gain in gain on settlement of debt 
this gain represents the satisfaction  at less than face value  of the million mortgage payable related to the property previously leased by robb stucky 
the million gain is net of a  write off of the balance of related deferred mortgage costs 
other loss income 
the decrease is due to an impairment charge recorded on marketable securities that had unrealized losses of  and that were sold in january and the inclusion in of  in interest income from marketable securities which were sold in for a  gain 
interest expense 
the following table summarizes interest expense for the periods indicated year ended december  increase decrease dollars in thousands change interest expense credit line interest mortgage interest total credit line interest the decrease is due to the million  or  reduction in the weighted average balance outstanding under our line of credit 
in february  we applied million of our public offering proceeds to reduce the then outstanding balance on our credit line

table of contents rental revenues rental income 
a significant component of the increase is the million of rental revenue generated from the properties we acquired in  of which million is attributable to our february acquisition of a community shopping center 
partially offsetting the increase was an approximately  decrease in rental income representing the december rent of  that was not accrued and the  net write off of the entire balance of unbilled rent receivable and lease intangibles resulting from robb stucky s bankruptcy filing 
robb stucky accounted for  or of our rental income 
approximately  of the increase represents real estate tax and expense reimbursements from tenants from three properties we acquired in lease termination fee

there was no comparable fee income in operating expenses the following table compares operating expenses for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands difference change operating expenses depreciation and amortization general and administrative real estate acquisition costs real estate expenses leasehold rent total operating expenses operating income depreciation and amortization 
the increase is substantially due to depreciation and amortization on the properties we acquired in general and administrative expense 
the increase is attributable principally to the following items i a  increase in the annual fee payable pursuant to the compensation and services agreement  and ii the inclusion of  of professional fees incurred in connection with an equity financing that was not pursued 
the net balance of the increase is attributable to increases in payroll  amortization expense relating to our restricted stock awards and the award of pay for performance restricted stock units  investor relations activities  and directors fees  none of which was material on an individual basis 
partially offsetting this increase was an  decrease from in expenses relating to litigation involving our former president s activities 
real estate acquisition costs 
these expenses increased because of our acquisition of properties 
we did not acquire any properties in but incurred  of such expense in in connection with an acquisition completed in february real estate expenses

approximately  of the decrease results primarily from a sale by a joint venture of its only property on april  at the same time the related lease expired and approximately  relates to a decrease in rental income of another joint venture 
interest expense 
the increase is due to increased interest expense on our outstanding mortgages and credit line 
net mortgage interest expense increased by approximately  or 
mortgage interest expense increased by approximately million due to the assumption  in connection with acquisitions  of mortgage debt in the aggregate amount of million and million in connection with the financing of certain properties  which increase was partially offset by the payoff or paydown of mortgage loans aggregating million  as well as regular monthly principal amortization of other mortgages 
the weighted average interest rate of the mortgages that were paid off and paid down in was approximately and the weighted average interest rate of the mortgages we assumed and on the properties we financed in is approximately 
in addition  interest expense relating to our revolving line of credit increased by  due primarily to the increase  effective april   in the interest rate charged thereunder 
amortization of deferred financing costs 
the decrease was primarily due to accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs of  relating to a mortgage loan that was refinanced during this was offset in part by the amortization of deferred financing costs that were incurred in connection with new financings 
income from settlement with former president 
in november  civil litigations commenced by us as plaintiff  against our former president and chief executive officer  arising out of his inappropriate financial dealings  were settled  and we received  in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at  based on the november  closing price 
we were also assigned an interest in a real estate consulting venture  the value of which was fully reserved against 

table of contents discontinued operations the following table sets forth a comparison of discontinued operations for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands difference change discontinued operations income from operations impairment charges gain on troubled mortgage restructuring  as a result of conveyance to mortgagee net gain on sales income from discontinued operations discontinued operations for includes the results of operations and the gain on sale of two properties sold in and the results of operations for one property sold in the year ended december  includes the results of operations of ten properties  five of which were conveyed by us to the mortgagee in july  three of which were sold in and three of which were sold in and included in income from discontinued operations for is a  lease termination payment from a retail tenant that had been paying its rent on a current basis  but vacated the property in in march  we sold this property and recorded an impairment charge of  to recognize the loss on the sale 
also included in income from discontinued operations for is an  gain recognized in connection with the conveyance of five of our properties to the mortgagee by deeds in lieu of foreclosure 
these properties had formerly been leased to circuit city stores inc which filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws and rejected the leases for these five properties 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity and capital include cash flow from our operations  cash and cash equivalents  available for sale securities  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  refinancing existing mortgage loans and obtaining mortgage loans secured by our unencumbered properties 
our available liquidity at december  was approximately million  including million of cash and cash equivalents   of available for sale securities and million available under our revolving line of credit 
liquidity and financing we expect to meet substantially all of our operating cash requirements including dividend payments from cash flow from operations 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is not adequate to cover all of our operating needs  we will be required to use our available cash and cash equivalents  sell our marketable securities or draw on our credit line to the extent permitted to satisfy operating requirements 
mortgage debt in aggregate principal amount of million is payable from march through december  ie  million in  million in and million in 
we generally intend to refinance or extend the mortgage loans which mature in through though no assurance can be given in this regard  we believe that we will be able to refinance or extend the repayment obligation of such debt because  among other things  approximately million of such mortgage debt secures properties with long term leases ie  expiring after and approximately million represents debt amortization payments  a portion of which will be paid from operating cash flow 
we intend to repay the amount not refinanced or extended from our existing funds and sources of funds  including our available cash and our credit line to the extent permitted and available 

table of contents we continually seek to refinance existing mortgage loans on terms we deem acceptable  in order to generate additional liquidity 
additionally  in the normal course of our business  we sell properties when we determine that it is in our best interests  which also generates additional liquidity 
further  since each of our encumbered properties is subject to a non recourse mortgage with standard carve outs  if our in house evaluation of the market value of such property is substantially less than the principal balance outstanding on the mortgage loan  we may determine to convey such property to the mortgagee in order to terminate our mortgage obligations  including payment of interest  principal and real estate taxes  with respect to such property 
typically  we utilize funds from a credit facility to acquire a property and  thereafter secure long term  fixed rate mortgage debt on such property 
we apply the proceeds from the mortgage loan to repay borrowings under the credit facility  thus providing us with the ability to re borrow under the credit facility for the acquisition of additional properties 
as a result  in order to grow our business  it is important to have a credit facility in place 
credit facility we can borrow up to million pursuant to our revolving credit facility which is available to us for the acquisition of commercial real estate  repayment of mortgage debt  and for any other purpose  provided  if used for a purpose other than a property acquisition or mortgage repayment  the amount borrowed for such other purpose will not exceed the lesser of million and of the permitted borrowing base 
the facility matures on march  and bears interest at the greater of i day libor plus and ii 
there is an unused facility fee of per annum on the difference between the outstanding loan balance and million 
we are required to maintain at least million average outstanding collected deposit balances 
the facility is guaranteed by our subsidiaries that own unencumbered properties and is to be secured by the outstanding stock of any newly formed subsidiary 
net proceeds received from the sale  financing or refinancing of properties are generally required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under the facility 
the terms of our revolving credit facility include certain restrictions and covenants which may limit  among other things  the incurrence of liens  and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to  among other things  the minimum amount of tangible net worth  the minimum amount of debt service coverage  the minimum amount of fixed charge coverage  the maximum amount of debt to value  the minimum level of net income  certain investment limitations and the minimum value of unencumbered properties and the number of such properties 
net proceeds received from the sale  financing or refinancing of properties are generally required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants under this facility 

table of contents contractual obligations the following sets forth our contractual obligations as of december   which includes interest and amortization payments and balances due at maturity under outstanding mortgages secured by our properties for the periods indicated 
it also includes the amount due at maturity under our credit facility 
payment due by period dollars in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations mortgages payable interest and amortization mortgages payable balances due at maturity credit facility purchase obligations total represents the amount outstanding as of december  we may borrow up to  under such facility 
includes  payable annually pursuant to the compensation and services agreement at the rate in effect at december  and assuming such agreement continues for only five years  amounts payable to lease office space from a related party and amounts payable pursuant to a ground lease 
as of december   we had million of mortgage debt outstanding excluding mortgage indebtedness of our unconsolidated joint ventures  all of which is non recourse subject to standard carve outs 
we expect that mortgage interest and amortization payments excluding repayments of principal at maturity of approximately million due through will be paid primarily from cash generated from our operations 
we anticipate that debt obligations due through of approximately million  including million currently outstanding under our credit facility  will be paid primarily from cash and cash equivalents and mortgage financings and refinancings 
if we are unsuccessful in refinancing our existing indebtedness or financing our unencumbered properties  our cash flow  funds available under our credit facility and available cash  if any  may not be sufficient to repay all debt obligations when payments become due  and we may need to issue additional equity  obtain long or short term debt  or dispose of properties on unfavorable terms 
cash distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute currently at least of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders pursuant to internal revenue procedures 
it is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal  state or local income taxes on taxable income we distribute currently in accordance with the internal revenue code and applicable regulations to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent tax years 
even if we qualify for federal taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income taxes on our undistributed taxable income ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and applicable regulations thereunder and are subject to federal excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 

table of contents it is our intention to pay to our stockholders within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code no less than  and  if possible  of our annual taxable income  including taxable gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities 
it will continue to be our policy to make sufficient distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our reit status under the internal revenue code 
in  our board determined that  in view of the economic environment  we should conserve our capital 
as a result  all of our dividends declared in consisted of stock and cash  pursuant to revenue procedures issued by the internal revenue service 
in and  we declared dividends all in cash of and per share  respectively 
our board of directors reviews the dividend policy at each regularly scheduled quarterly board meeting to determine if any changes to our dividend should be made 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these critical accounting policies include the following  discussed below 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate the fair value of real estate acquired is allocated to acquired tangible assets  consisting of land and building  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases and other value of in place leases based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land and building is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land and building based on management s determination of relative fair values of these assets 
we assess fair value of the lease intangibles based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount rates and available market information 
the fair values associated with below market rental renewal options are determined based on our experience and the relevant facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the acquisitions 
the portion of the values of the leases associated with below market renewal options that are likely to be exercised are amortized to rental income over the respective renewal periods 
the allocation made by management may have a positive or negative effect on net income and may have an effect on the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
revenues our revenues  which are substantially derived from rental income  include rental income that our tenants pay in accordance with the terms of their respective leases reported on a straight line basis over the term of each lease 
it is our policy not to record straight line rent beyond the expected useful life of a building 
since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset and include in revenues  unbilled rent receivables which we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the term of the lease 
accordingly  our management must determine  in its judgment  that the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review unbilled rent receivables on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant s payment history and the financial condition of the tenant 
in the event that the collectability of an unbilled rent receivable is in doubt  we are 
table of contents required to take a reserve against the receivable or a direct write off of the receivable  which has an adverse affect on net income for the year in which the reserve or direct write off is taken  and will decrease total assets and stockholders equity 
carrying value of real estate portfolio we review our real estate portfolio on a quarterly basis to ascertain if there are any indicators of impairment to the carrying value of any of our real estate assets  including deferred costs and intangibles  in order to determine if there is any need for an impairment charge 
in reviewing the portfolio  we examine the type of asset  the current financial statements or other available financial information of the tenant  the economic situation in the area in which the asset is located  the economic situation in the industry in which the tenant is involved and the timeliness of the payments made by the tenant under its lease  as well as any current correspondence that may have been had with the tenant  including property inspection reports 
for each real estate asset owned for which indicators of impairment exist  if the undiscounted cash flow analysis yields an amount which is less than the asset s carrying amount  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the estimated fair value is less than the asset s carrying amount 
the estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model of the expected future cash flows through the useful life of the property 
real estate assets that are expected to be disposed of are valued at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell on an individual asset basis 
we generally do not obtain any independent appraisals in determining value but rely on our own analysis and valuations 
any impairment charge taken with respect to any part of our real estate portfolio will reduce our net income and reduce assets and stockholders equity to the extent of the amount of any impairment charge  but it will not affect our cash flow or our distributions until such time as we dispose of the property 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
our primary market risk exposure is the effect of changes in interest rates on the interest cost of draws on our revolving variable rate credit facility and the effect of changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
at december   we had five interest rate swap agreements outstanding including one held by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
the fair market value of the interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december   if there had been a increase in forward interest rates  the fair market value of the interest rate swaps and net unrealized gain on derivative instruments would have increased by approximately  if there were a decrease in forward interest rates  the fair market value of the interest rate swaps and net unrealized gain on derivative instruments would have decreased by approximately  these changes would not have any impact on our net income or cash 
from time to time  we utilize interest rate swaps to limit interest rate risk 
these swaps are used for hedging purposes not for speculation 
we do not enter into interest rate swaps for trading purposes 
our mortgage debt excluding our mortgages subject to the interest rate swap agreements  bears interest at fixed rates and accordingly  the effect of changes in interest rates would not impact the amount of interest expense that we incur under these mortgages 
our credit facility is a revolving variable rate facility which is sensitive to interest rates 
under current market conditions  we do not believe that our risk of material potential losses in future earnings  fair values and or cash flows from near term changes in market rates that we consider reasonably possible is material 
we assessed the market risk for our revolving credit facility and believe that there is no foreseeable market risk because interest is charged at the greater of i day libor plus and 
table of contents ii per annum 
at december   day libor plus was approximately  therefore  a increase or decrease would not have any impact on our interest expense related to this facility 
the fair market value of our long term debt is estimated based on discounting future cash flows at interest rates that our management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration 
the following table sets forth our debt obligations by scheduled principal cash flow payments and maturity date  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value at december  for the year ended december  dollars in thousands thereafter total fair market value fixed rate long term debt weighted average interest rate variable rate long term debt our credit facility matures on march  and bears interest at the greater of i and ii day libor plus
