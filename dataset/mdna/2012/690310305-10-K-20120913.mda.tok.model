table of contents overview this overview discusses matters on which our management primarily focuses in evaluating our financial position and operating performance 
generation of revenue 
we generate the majority of our revenue from sales of our data protection products 
the balance of our revenue is provided by selling maintenance contracts and rendering related services  and earning royalties on our licensed technology 
the majority of our sales are generated from sales of our branded products through a worldwide channel  which includes systems integrators and vars 
business transition 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we fulfilled all our obligations for supply of tape libraries to our sole oem customer  however  we will continue to provide spare parts and services under the agreement 
in fiscal  revenue from our sole oem customer decreased by compared to fiscal oem product revenue  including spare parts  accounted for and of sales in fiscal and  respectively 
oem total revenue accounted for and of net revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
we reported net revenue of million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the decline in net revenue resulted in a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal compared with a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal intellectual property rights 
in august and october  we filed patent infringement lawsuits in the united states district court for the southern district of california and united states international trade commission itc  respectively  against various parties 
both lawsuits claim infringement of two of our united states patents  nos 
 and  in november  we entered into a multi year settlement and cross licensing agreement with ibm pursuant to which we released all claims we had against dell and ibm in the united states district court for the southern district of california and at the itc 
however  our infringement case against bdt ag and its affiliates continues 
in july  the itc released the public version of the initial determination  which finds that the six asserted claims of us patent no 
 are valid 
the initial determination finds no infringement of united states patent no 
 we petitioned the full commission of the itc for a review of some of the initial determination findings 
the commission has decided to review in part the initial determination on its merits and the commission is expected to issue its decision in a final determination by october  see item legal proceedings for additional information on the patent litigation lawsuits 
in june  we filed five additional patent infringement lawsuits in the united states district court for the southern district of california against seven companies 
see item legal proceedings for additional information on these patent litigation lawsuits 
in august  quantum corporation filed counterclaims against us in the united states district court for the southern district of california action  alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition claims  and infringement of united states patent nos 
   and  by our products 
quantum is seeking monetary damages from us and injunctive relief 
liquidity and capital resources 
at june   we had a cash balance of million  compared to million at june  in fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately million and net proceeds of approximately million 
in august  we entered into a credit facility that provides for an million secured revolving loan and may be used to fund our working capital and our general business requirements 
cash management and preservation continue to be a top priority 
we expect to incur negative operating cash flows during the remainder of calendar year as we continue to reshape our business model and further improve operational efficiencies 

table of contents management has projected that cash on hand  combined with available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to allow us to continue operations for the next months 
significant changes from our current forecasts  including but not limited to i shortfalls from projected sales levels  ii unexpected increases in product costs  iii increases in operating costs and or iv changes in the historical timing of collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
this could force us to make further reductions in spending  extend payment terms with suppliers  liquidate assets where possible and or suspend or curtail planned programs 
any of these actions could materially harm our business  results of operations and future prospects 
as of june   we had working capital of million  reflecting decreases in current assets and current liabilities of million and million  respectively  during fiscal the decrease in current assets is primarily attributable to a million decrease in accounts receivable due to lower sales  and a million decrease in other current assets primarily due to a decrease in prepaid service contracts 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in inventory due to significant purchases at fiscal year end for the first quarter of fiscal product sales  and million increase in cash 
the decrease in current liabilities is primarily attributable to a million decrease in the fair value of an equity award  offset by a slight increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to operating activities 
industry trends 
we estimate that the cost of managing digital assets is four times the cost of acquiring storage devices 
furthermore  many smes and smbs are seeking to implement tiered storage for primary and secondary data utilizing a combination of low cost sata serial ata drives  high performance sas serial attached scsi and solid state drives ssds drives 
idc estimates that the total nas market will grow at approximately through  and the growth rate for nas storage systems in price bands up to  where our snapserver solutions lie  is estimated to be 
according to idc  tape storage still constitutes approximately of the total storage revenue in the global storage market 
sales of tape automation appliances represented and of our revenue during fiscal and  respectively 
recent developments in july  we released the snapsan for midrange businesses  and the snapsan for the enterprise  which replaced the snapsan s both systems are highlighted by features like thin provisioning  volume cloning  synchronous and asynchronous remote replication  snapshots and disk spin down for reduced power consumption 
the snapsan offers additional performance  ssd integration for caching and policy based tiering  and performance analysis  tuning and compliance tools 
in august  we announced that randy gast joined us as senior vice president of strategic alliances and client services 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  share based compensation  bad debts  inventories  intangible and other long lived assets  warranty obligations and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents critical accounting policies are those policies that  in management s view  are most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements also include disclosure of significant accounting policies 
the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements 
these critical accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies and estimates that require the most significant judgment are discussed further below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred 
under this policy  revenue on direct product sales excluding sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of products to our customers 
these customers are not entitled to any specific right of return or price protection  except for any defective product that may be returned under our warranty policy 
generally  title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when the product leaves our dock 
product sales to distribution customers are subject to certain rights of return  stock rotation privileges and price protection 
because we are unable to estimate our exposure for returned product or price adjustments  revenue from shipments to these customers is not recognized until the related products are in turn sold to the ultimate customer by the distributor 
for products in which software is more than an incidental component  we recognize revenue in accordance with current authoritative guidance for software revenue recognition 
we have various royalty arrangements with independent service providers that sell our product and also sell and provide service on our product 
these independent service providers pay a royalty fee for service contracts in place on our product 
the royalty fee is calculated by us for the units covered in the quarter  and agreed to by the service provider  based upon the monthly fee for each unit covered by the independent service provider 
we have various licensing agreements relating to our variable rate randomizer vr technology with third parties 
the licensees pay us a royalty fee for sales of their products that incorporate our vr technology 
the licensees provide us with periodic reports that include the quantity of units  subject to royalty  sold to their end users 
we record the royalty when reported to us by the licensee  generally in the period during which the licensee ships the products containing vr technology 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts and the overall condition of the accounts receivable portfolio 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific trade and other receivables  historical bad debts  customer credits  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customers payment terms and or patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  impairing their ability to make additional payments  then we may need to make additional allowances 
likewise  if we determine that we could realize more of our receivables in the future than previously estimated  we would adjust the allowance to increase income in the period we made the determination 
we review the allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis and record adjustments as considered necessary 
generally  our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification 
if we fail to identify an account as doubtful  or if we identify an account as uncollectible that is later collected  our results could vary 

table of contents share based compensation share based compensation expense can be significant to our results of operations  even though no cash is used for such expense 
in determining period expense associated with unvested options  we estimate the fair value of each option at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the award 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our stock and the expected term the average employee will hold the option prior to the date of exercise 
in addition  we estimate pre vesting forfeitures for share based awards that are not expected to vest 
we primarily use historical data to determine the inputs and assumptions to be used in the black scholes pricing model 
changes in these inputs and assumptions could occur and could materially affect the measure of estimated fair value and make it difficult to compare the results in future periods to our current results 
a change in our share based compensation for the year ended june  would have affected our net loss by million 
inventory valuation we record inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we assess the value of our inventories periodically based upon numerous factors including  among others  expected product or material demand  current market conditions  technological obsolescence  current cost and net realizable value 
if necessary  we adjust our inventory for obsolete or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than we project  we may need to record additional inventory adjustments and adverse purchase commitments 
warranty obligations we provide for estimated future costs of warranty obligations in accordance with current accounting rules 
for return to factory and on site warranties  we accrue for warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based on contractual rights and on the historical rate of claims and costs to provide warranty services 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims above historical experience or our costs to provide warranty services increase  we may be required to increase our warranty accrual 
any such unforeseen increases may have an adverse impact on our gross margins in the periods in which they occur 
similarly  if we experience a decrease in warranty claims or our costs to provide services decline  we may be required to decrease our warranty accrual  which may have a favorable impact on our gross margins in the periods in which they occur

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal net revenue 
net revenue decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decline was due to lower revenue from our overland branded products primarily as a result of decreased sales volumes in our taped based and disk based products sold in the americas and emea 
in addition  decreased revenues from our sole oem customer represented approximately of the overall decrease in revenues  as a result of the fulfillment of all our obligations for the supply of tape libraries in the fourth quarter of fiscal product revenue net product revenue decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or  was primarily associated with i a decrease of million in oem revenue related to the fulfillment of our obligations under the product supply portion of an agreement with our sole oem customer  ii million decrease in sales of our neo products  iii million decrease in sales of our snapserver products  iv million decrease in sales of spare parts  and v million decrease in sales of our reo products 
the decrease in sales of our snapserver products was primarily attributable to two factors i we increased the selling price of our snapserver products as a result of the increased cost of disk drives due to the severe flooding in thailand in october  which negatively impacted short term demand for these products  and ii the production ramp up time for our newly launched disk based products was longer than originally anticipated  which has caused customers to delay orders 
service revenue net service revenue was relatively constant at million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal royalty fees net royalty fees decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  was primarily associated with lower vr technology royalties 
vr technology royalties during fiscal totaled million compared with million during fiscal gross profit

product revenue gross profit on product revenue during fiscal was million compared to million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  was primarily due to the decrease in net product revenue 
gross margin on product revenue at for fiscal decreased from for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to increased prices for disk drives for our disk based products as a result of the flooding in thailand in october  as well as additional production costs incurred when we launched our new disk based products 
service revenue gross profit on service revenue during fiscal was million compared to million during fiscal the increase of million  or  was primarily due to our performing an increasing portion of service repair internally beginning the third quarter of fiscal  rather than utilizing third party vendors 
gross margin on service revenue at for fiscal increased from for fiscal 
table of contents sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense in fiscal decreased to million from million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  was primarily a result of a decrease of million in employee and related expenses associated with a decrease in the average headcount  offset by an increase of million in public relations and advertising expense  including contractor fees  due to reductions in marketing programs and bringing previously outsourced projects in house  and an increase of million in share based compensation expense primarily associated with options granted to an executive officer

general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense in fiscal decreased to million from million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  was primarily a result of i a decrease of million in in employee related expenses associated with a decreases in average headcount and facility costs related to the downsizing of our san diego facility  ii a decrease of million in outside contractor and audit expenses  principally for financial and accounting services  and iii a decrease of million in fees as a result of the termination of our two non oem financing agreements

the decrease was primarily a result of the termination of our two non oem financing agreements 
interest expense in fiscal was related to borrowings on our credit facility 
other income expense  net 
during fiscal  we incurred other income expense  net  of million of income compared with million of income during fiscal the change of million  or  was primarily due to the receipt of million in fiscal related to the recovery of accounts receivable in our foreign subsidiaries previously written off in  compared to the receipt of million in fiscal from various institutional investors in consideration for a minority ownership interest in any amounts we receive from litigation awards or settlements arising from our patent infringement lawsuits 
in addition  we realized million in foreign currency gains in fiscal  compared to million in realized foreign currency losses in fiscal provision for income taxes 
during fiscal  we recognized income tax expense of million compared to million in fiscal the decrease of million is primarily due to a reduction in tax rate for our foreign operations 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had a cash balance of million  compared to million at june  in fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million

table of contents significant purchases at fiscal year end for first quarter of fiscal product sales  and million increase in cash 
the decrease in current liabilities is primarily attributable to a million decrease in the fair value of an equity award  offset by a slight increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to operating activities 
management has projected that cash on hand  combined with available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to allow us to continue operations for the next months 
significant changes from our current forecasts  including but not limited to i shortfalls from projected sales levels  ii unexpected increases in product costs  iii increases in operating costs and or iv changes in the historical timing of collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
this could force us to make further reductions in spending  extend payment terms with suppliers  liquidate assets where possible and or suspend or curtail planned programs 
any of these actions could materially harm our business  results of operations and future prospects 
as a result of our recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows  the report from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
during fiscal  we used cash in operating activities of million  compared to million in fiscal the use of cash during fiscal was primarily a result of our net loss of million offset by million in non cash items  which were share based compensation  depreciation and amortization

inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the periods presented 
historically  we have been able to pass on to our customers increases in raw material prices caused by inflation

recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically  we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
foreign currency risk 
we conduct business on a global basis and essentially all of our products sold in international markets are denominated in us dollars 
historically  export sales have represented a significant portion of our sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of sales 
our wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom  france and germany incur costs that are denominated in local currencies 
as exchange rates vary  these results may vary from expectations when translated into us dollars  which could adversely impact overall expected results 
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations during fiscal and resulted in a gain of million for fiscal and a loss of million for fiscal
