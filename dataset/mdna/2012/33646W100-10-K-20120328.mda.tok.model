the business of the bank consists principally of attracting deposits from the general public and using them to originate secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans  permanent mortgage and construction loans secured by single family residences and other loans 
the bank s earnings depend primarily on its net interest income  the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the volume of noninterest income and noninterest expenses also impacts the bank s earnings 
prevailing economic conditions  competition  as well as federal and state regulations  affect the operations of the bank 
the bank s cost of funds is influenced by interest rates paid on competing investments  rates offered on deposits by other financial institutions in the bank s market area and by general market interest rates 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing of real estate and various types of commercial  consumer and mortgage loans  and by the interest rates offered on such financing

liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity generally refers to the bank s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its funding needs 
adequate liquidity guarantees sufficient funds are available to meet deposit withdrawals  fund loan commitments  maintain adequate reserve requirements  pay operating expenses  provide funds for debt service  and meet other general commitments

interest rate risk 
interest rate risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates 
the risk of loss can be reflected in diminished and or reduced potential net interest income in future periods 
interest rate risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending and deposit taking activities 
the bank considers interest rate risk to be a significant risk  which could potentially have a material impact on operating earnings 
interest rate risk is measured by computing estimated changes in net interest income and the economic value of equity eve of the cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the bank s exposure to interest rates is reviewed on a quarterly basis by management and the board 
exposure to interest rate risk is measured with the use of interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the potential change in net interest income and eve in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates  while interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is used to determine the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
if estimated changes to net interest income and eve are not within board established target risk tolerance limits  the board may direct management to adjust the bank s asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within the approved target limits 
the eve calculation is based on the net present value of discounted cash flows utilizing market prepayment assumptions 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the bank may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
eve represents the economic value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis assesses the potential loss in risk sensitive instruments in the event of sudden and sustained to increases and decreases in market interest rates 
with the federal reserve s current policy of continuing to hold interest rates at lower levels  it is not foreseeable that interest rates can decline below zero if downward rate environment assumptions were run 
any data produced by these assumptions would not be reliable 
therefore  the bank will not run any downward rate assumptions until interest rates increase 
the board has adopted an interest rate risk management policy that establishes maximum increases in net interest income of   and  and maximum decreases in eve of   and in the event of sudden and sustained to increases in market interest rates 
table below presents a static simulation projection of changes in eve and net interest income  before provision for credit losses pcl  only in the event of sudden and sustained increases in market interest rates for the various rate shock levels at december  at december   the bank s estimated changes in eve and net interest income were within the board established target limits 
table projected change in eve and net interest income economic value of portfolio equity net interest income before pcl change in rates amount change change amount change change dollars in thousands bp     bp     bp    bp    base   certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in table for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities to repricing  they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in addition  the proportion of adjustable rate loans in the bank s portfolio could decrease in future periods due to refinance activity if market interest rates remain at or decrease below current levels 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in the table 
also  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an increase in interest rates 
the bank uses interest sensitivity gap analysis to monitor the relationship between the maturity and repricing of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
interest sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities  and is considered negative when the amount of interest sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would negatively affect net interest income 
the bank s goal is to maintain a reasonable balance between exposure to interest rate fluctuations and earnings 
asset liability management 
the bank strives to maintain consistent net interest income and reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by matching the terms to repricing of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
factors beyond the bank s control  such as market interest rates and competition  may also impact interest income and interest expense 
the bank s net interest income will generally increase when interest rates rise over an extended period of time  and conversely  will decrease when interest rates decline 
the bank can significantly influence its net interest income by controlling the increases and decreases in its interest income and interest expense  which are primarily caused by changes in market interest rates 
interest rate risk and trends  liquidity and capital ratio requirements are reported to the board of directors the board on a regular basis 
the board reviews the maturities of the bank s assets and liabilities and establishes policies and strategies designed to regulate the flow of funds and to coordinate the sources  uses and pricing of such funds 
the first priority in structuring and pricing assets and liabilities is to maintain an acceptable interest rate spread while reducing the net effects of changes in interest rates 
the bank s management is responsible for administering the policies and determinations of the board with respect to the bank s asset and liability goals and strategies 
a primary component in managing interest rate risk is based on the volume of interest sensitive assets such as commercial loans  consumer loans and lease financing receivables 
commercial loans  consumer loans and lease receivables declined to million at december   from million at december  the bank also had million of loans held for sale at december   compared to million at december  depending on conditions existing at a given time  the bank may sell fixed rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market 
in managing its portfolio of investment securities  a majority of mortgage backed securities are held as available for sale  allowing the bank to sell a security in a timely manner should an immediate liquidity need arise 
mortgage backed securities classified as available for sale increased to million at december   from million at december  the bank uses interest sensitivity gap analysis to monitor the relationship between the maturity and repricing of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
interest sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities  and is considered negative when the amount of interest sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would negatively affect net interest income 
the bank s goal is to maintain a reasonable balance between exposure to interest rate fluctuations and earnings 
rate volume analysis 
net interest income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changing interest rates and changing volume on average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities 
table below represents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities have affected the company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
for each category of average interest earning asset and average interest bearing liability  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by old rate  ii changes in rate change in rate multiplied by old volume  iii changes in rate volume changes in rate multiplied by the changes in volume  and iv net change total of the previous columns 
analysis of net interest income 
net interest income primarily represents the difference between income derived from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by both the difference between the yield on earning assets and the average cost of funds interest rate spread  and the relative volume of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and noninterest bearing deposits 
table below sets forth certain information relating to the company s statements of financial condition and statements of operations for the years ended december    and  reflecting the yield on average earning assets and the average cost of funds for the periods indicated 
average balances are derived from month end balances 
the company does not believe that using month end balances rather than average daily balances has caused any material difference in the information presented 
the decline in net interest income results primarily from the decline in market interest rates and the decline in the volume of average earning assets 
the decline in market interest rates has been significantly influenced by the federal reserve s current policy of holding interest rates at record low levels in efforts to stimulate current economic conditions 
the decline in the volume of earning assets has been influenced by a slowdown in loan originations due to the current recessionary economic environment  and the current volume of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned  as discussed below

nonperforming loans  including nonperforming restructured loans  increased to million at december   from million at december  the current level of nonperforming loans  consisting primarily of residential and commercial real estate loans  is attributable to the current economic environment and the financial stress of certain borrowers 
downward pressure has impacted the market values of housing and other real estate  significantly impacting property values in the bank s market area and credit quality of certain borrowers 
management has thoroughly evaluated all nonperforming loans and believes they are either well collateralized or adequately reserved 
however  there can be no assurance in the future that regulators  increased credit risks in the loan portfolio  further declines in economic conditions and other factors will not require additional fair value adjustments to the nonperforming loans 
the bank s unrecognized interest on nonperforming loans was million at both december  and december  the ratio of non performing loans to total loans increased to at december   from at december  see provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses below for additional discussion 
other real estate owned increased to million at december   from million at december   reflecting foreclosures of certain real estate properties  net of sales

the company reported net income of million for the year ended december   compared to a net operating loss of million for the year ended december  the net income per diluted common share was per share for  compared to net loss per diluted common share of per share for the volume of net earnings during was influenced by the amount of provisions for credit losses required to replenish net charge offs  a decline in the volume of earning assets and an increase in the volume of non earning assets between the respective reporting periods  while being partially offset by a reduction in interest funding expense 
the current economy continues to present a challenging credit environment for the bank  for its customers and for the banking industry 
the bank continues to monitor and evaluate all significant loans in its portfolio  and will continue to manage its credit risk exposure in anticipation of future stabilization of the real estate market 
management believes competition and pricing pressures will continue on both deposits and loans into the amount and timing of any future federal reserve rate adjustments remains uncertain  and may further impact the bank if those adjustments are significant 
as the bank manages through the current economic cycle  it remains focused on long term strategies 
these strategies include remediating problem assets  maintaining adequate levels of capital and liquidity  improving efficiency in operations  building core customer relationships and improving franchise value along with stockholder value 
the bank continues to maintain a strong capital position in excess of the well capitalized regulatory guidelines  and combined with strengthening of the allowance for credit losses should enhance future earnings as economic conditions substantially improve

provision for credit losses 
the bank provided million for credit losses in  compared to million provided in these provisions were necessary to replenish net charge offs of million for  compared to million for  in order to bring the allowance for credit losses to an appropriate level in consideration of the inherent risk identified in the loan and lease portfolio and to provide support for the current volume of nonperforming loans discussed above 
allowance for credit losses 
the bank maintains allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments collectively the allowance for credit losses at levels it believes are adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and in unfunded loan commitments 
the bank has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses that reflect the assessment of credit risk and impairment analysis 
this assessment includes an analysis of qualitative and quantitative trends in the levels of classified loans 
in developing this analysis  the bank relies on historical loss experience  valuation estimates and exercises judgment in assessing credit risk exposure 
future assessments of credit risk may yield different results  depending on changes in market values and qualitative and quantitative trends  which may require increases or decreases in the allowance for credit losses 
the bank uses a variety of modeling  calculation methods and estimation tools for measuring credit risk and performing impairment analysis  which is the basis used in developing the allowance for credit losses 
the factors supporting the allowance for credit losses do not diminish the fact that the entire allowance is available to absorb probable losses 
the bank s principal focus is on the adequacy of the total allowance for credit losses 
based on the overall credit quality of the loan and lease receivable portfolio  the bank believes it has established the allowance for credit losses pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and has taken into account current market values  the views of its regulators and the current economic environment 
management evaluates the information upon which it bases the allowance for credit losses quarterly and believes their accounting decisions remain accurate 
however  there can be no assurance in the future that regulators  increased risks in its loans and leases portfolio  changes in economic conditions and other factors will not require additional adjustments to the allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses was million at december   compared to million at december  the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans and leases was at december   compared to at december   which management believes is appropriate
