item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we operate distinctive and large  multi use sports and athletic  professional fitness  family recreation and spa centers in a resort like environment 
as of february   we operated centers primarily in residential locations across states under the life time fitness and life time athletic sm brands 
we compare the results of our centers based on how long the centers have been open at the most recent measurement period 
we include a center for same center revenue purposes beginning on the first day of the thirteenth full calendar month of the center s operation  prior to which time we refer to the center as a new center 
we include an acquired center for same center revenue purposes beginning on the first day of the thirteenth full calendar month after we assumed the center s operations 
as we grow our presence in existing markets by opening new centers  we expect to attract some memberships away from our other existing centers in those markets  reducing revenue and initially lowering the memberships of those existing centers 
in addition  as a result of new center openings in existing markets  and because older centers will represent an increasing proportion of our center base over time  our same center revenue may be lower in future periods than in the past 
of the three new large format centers we plan to open in  one will be in an existing market 
in addition  in january  we acquired racquet club of the south  a tennis facility in the atlanta market  which we rebranded as life time tennis atlanta 
we do not expect that operating costs of our planned new centers will be significantly higher than centers opened in the past  and we also do not expect that the planned increase in the number of centers will have a material adverse effect on the overall financial condition or results of operations of existing centers 
during  we began to see improved center operating margins  primarily due to price and membership mix  which have more than offset the growth of our in center businesses which are lower margin 
in late  we acquired six previously leased centers  which we expect will result in lower occupancy costs and improved center operating margins 
this margin improvement is expected to more than offset lower margins we expect from our acquisition of the nine lifestyle family fitness lff centers  which have higher occupancy costs as a result of lease expense 
in and  we experienced increased member attrition and lower revenue per membership as well as higher membership acquisition costs compared to historical levels due to the challenging economic environment 
although attrition levels improved in and  if the challenging economic conditions were to continue  we may face continued lower revenue and operating profit in affected centers and on a consolidated basis 
certain of our markets may be impacted more severely than others as a result of regional economic factors such as housing  competition or unemployment rates 
our categories of new centers and existing centers do not include the center owned by bloomingdale  llc because it is accounted for as an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate and is not consolidated in our financial statements 
we measure performance using such key operating statistics as member satisfaction ratings  return on investment  average revenue per membership  including membership dues and enrollment fees  average in center revenue per membership and center operating expenses  with an emphasis on payroll and occupancy costs  as a percentage of sales and same center revenue growth 
we use center revenue and ebitda margins to evaluate overall performance 
table of contents and profitability on an individual center basis 
in addition  we focus on several membership statistics on a center level and system wide basis 
these metrics include change in center membership levels and growth of system wide memberships  percentage center membership to target capacity  center membership usage  center membership mix among individual  couple and family memberships  flex memberships and center attrition rates 
during and  our annual attrition rate decreased from to 
during  our annual attrition rate decreased from to 
over the past three years we saw our attrition rate decrease due in part to increased programming focused on member engagement and center utilization 
we have three primary sources of revenue first  our largest source of revenue is membership dues of total revenue for the year ended december   down from for the year ended december  and enrollment fees of total revenue for the year ended december   down from for the year ended december  paid by our members 
we recognize revenue from monthly membership dues in the month to which they pertain 
second  we generate revenue within a center  which we refer to as in center revenue or in center businesses of total revenue for the year ended december   up from for the year ended december   including fees for personal training  registered dietitians  group fitness training and other member activities  sales of products at our lifecafe  sales of products and services offered at our lifespa  tennis programs and renting space in certain of our centers 
third  we have expanded the life time fitness brand into other wellness related offerings that generate revenue  which we refer to as other revenue or corporate businesses of total revenue for the year ended december   up from for the year ended december   including our media  wellness and athletic events businesses 
our primary media offering is our magazine  experience life 
other revenue also includes one stand alone restaurant in the minneapolis market and rental income from our highland park  minnesota office building 
center operations expenses consist primarily of salary  commissions  payroll taxes  benefits  real estate taxes and other occupancy costs  utilities  repairs and maintenance  supplies  administrative support and communications to operate our centers 
advertising and marketing expenses consist of our marketing department costs and media and advertising costs to support and grow center membership levels  in center businesses  new center openings and our corporate businesses 
general and administrative expenses include costs relating to our centralized support functions  such as accounting  information systems  procurement  real estate and development and member relations 
our other operating expenses include the costs associated with our media  athletic events and nutritional product businesses  one restaurant and other corporate expenses  as well as gains or losses on our dispositions of assets 
our total operating expenses may vary from period to period depending on the number of new centers opened during that period  the number of centers engaged in presale activities and the performance of our in center businesses 
our primary capital expenditures relate to the construction of new centers and updating and maintaining our existing centers 
the land acquisition  construction and equipment costs for a current model center can vary considerably based on variability in land cost  the cost of construction labor and the size or amenities of the center  including the addition of tennis facilities  an expanded gymnasium or other facilities 
we perform maintenance and make improvements on our centers and equipment throughout each year 
we conduct a more thorough remodeling project at each center approximately every four to six years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
ultimate results could differ from those estimates 
in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations  we use estimates based on the best information available 
we use estimates for such items as depreciable lives  probability of meeting certain performance targets and tax provisions 
we also use estimates for calculating the amortization period for deferred enrollment fee revenue and associated direct costs  which are based on the historical estimated average membership life 
we revise the recorded estimates when better information is available  facts change or we can determine actual amounts 
these 
table of contents revisions can affect operating results 
we have identified below the following accounting policies that we consider to be critical 
revenue recognition 
we receive a one time enrollment fee at the time a member joins and monthly membership dues for usage from our members 
the enrollment fees are non refundable after days 
enrollment fees and related direct expenses  primarily sales commissions  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over an estimated average membership life of months  which is based on historical membership experience 
we review the estimated average membership life on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances change 
changes in member behavior  competition  economic conditions and our performance may cause attrition levels to change  which could impact the estimated average membership life 
our attrition rate in improved slightly from a high of at the end of first quarter to at year end  and our estimated average membership life was months 
during  our annual attrition rate decreased from to 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed our estimated average membership life from months to months 
during  our annual attrition rate decreased from to and our estimated average membership life remained months 
if the estimated average membership life had been months or months for the entire year ended december   the impact of this change in accounting estimate on our income from continuing operations and net income would have been less than million  and the change in accounting estimate would have had no impact on our basic and diluted earnings per common share 
if the direct expenses related to the enrollment fees exceed the enrollment fees for any center  the amount of direct expenses in excess of the enrollment fees are expensed in the current period instead of deferred over the average membership life 
the amount of direct expenses in excess of enrollment fees totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
monthly membership dues paid in advance of a center opening are deferred until the center opens 
we only offer members month to month memberships and recognize as revenue the monthly membership dues in the month to which they pertain 
we provide services at each of our centers  including personal training  spa  caf and other member services 
the revenue associated with these services is recognized at the time the service is performed 
personal training revenue received in advance of training sessions and the related commissions are deferred and recognized when services are performed 
other revenue  which includes revenue generated primarily from our media  athletic events and restaurant  is recognized when realized and earned 
media advertising revenue is recognized over the duration of the advertising placement 
for athletic events  revenue is generated primarily through sponsorship sales and registration fees 
athletic event revenue is recognized upon the completion of the event 
restaurant revenue is recognized at the point of sale to the customer 
share based compensation 
we maintain share based incentive plans  which include nonvested share awards  stock options and an employee stock purchase plan 
see note  share based compensation to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our share based compensation plans 
we determine the fair value of our nonvested share awards at the date of grant using the closing market price of our stock 
performance based restricted share awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals 
in june and august  the compensation committee approved the grant of  and  shares  respectively  of long term performance based restricted stock to serve as an incentive to our senior management team to achieve certain diluted earnings per share eps targets in and as of december    of these shares were still outstanding 
a specified eps target was achieved for fiscal and of the restricted shares vested 
since the grant was not fully vested after fiscal  of the shares will vest if a specified eps target is achieved for fiscal in the event that we do not achieve the specified eps target for fiscal  the remaining restricted stock will be forfeited 
the probability of reaching the targets is evaluated each reporting period 
as of december  we determined that the second vesting was probable 
we anticipate recognizing the remaining portion of performance share based compensation expense of approximately million pretax ratably in if we later determine that it is not probable that the minimum diluted eps performance threshold for will be met  no further compensation cost will be recognized and any recognized compensation cost relating to the shares that have not vested will be reversed 

table of contents our employee stock purchase plan espp provides for the sale of shares of our common stock to our employees at discounted purchase prices 
the cost per share under this plan is of the fair market value of our common stock on the last day of the purchase period  as defined 
compensation expense under the espp is based on the discount of at the end of the purchase period 
a change in our share based compensation expense for the year ended december  would have affected net income by approximately million in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated for the year ended december  revenue membership dues enrollment fees in center revenue total center revenue other revenue total revenue operating expenses center operations advertising and marketing general and administrative other operating depreciation and amortization total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest expense  net equity in earnings of affiliate total other income expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue

in december  bloomingdale llc entered into a management agreement with us  pursuant to which we agreed to manage the day to day operations of the center  subject to the overall supervision by the management committee of bloomingdale llc  which is comprised of six members  two from each of the three members of the joint venture 
we have no unilateral control of the center  as all decisions essential to the accomplishments of the purpose of the joint venture require the approval of a majority of the members 
bloomingdale llc is accounted for as an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate and is not consolidated in our financial statements 
additional details related to our interest in bloomingdale llc are provided in note to our consolidated financial statements 
non gaap financial measures we use ebitda  ebitdar and free cash flow as measures of operating performance 
ebitda and ebitdar should not be considered substitutes for net income  cash flows provided by operating activities  or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with gaap 
the funds depicted by ebitda and ebitdar are not necessarily available for discretionary use if they are reserved for particular capital purposes  to maintain compliance with debt covenants  to service debt or to pay taxes 
we believe ebitda and ebitdar are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because both are widely accepted financial indicators of a company s ability to service its debt and we are required to comply with certain covenants and borrowing limitations that are based on variations of ebitda and ebitdar in certain of our financing documents  and both are widely used to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization  which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets  and to present a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
our management uses ebitda and or ebitdar as measurements of operating performance because they assist us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis  in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board to have the same consistent measurement basis of operating performance used by management  and as the basis for incentive bonuses paid to selected members of senior and center level management 
we have provided reconciliations of ebitda and ebitdar to net income in the selected financial data section 
free cash flow is a non gaap measure consisting of net cash provided by operating activities  less purchases of property and equipment  excluding acquisitions 
this term  as we define it  may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure used by other companies and does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance presented in accordance with gaap 
we use free cash flow as a measure of cash generated after spending on property and equipment 
free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with gaap 
additional details related to free cash flow are provided in the selected financial data section 

table of contents we believe free cash flow is useful to an investor in understanding our cash flow generation and liquidity because free cash flow allows us to evaluate the cash generated by operations and the ability of our operations to fund investment items related to purchases of property and equipment  repay indebtedness  add to our cash balance  or to use in other discretionary activities  and if negative  free cash flow reflects the need for incremental financing activities or use of existing cash balances 
our management uses the measure of free cash flow to monitor cash available for repayment of indebtedness  and in discussions with the investment community 
we have provided reconciliations of free cash flow to cash flows from operations in the selected financial data section 
seasonality of business seasonal trends have an effect on our overall business 
generally  we have experienced greater membership growth at the beginning of the year 
we also experience increased membership in certain centers during the summer pool season 
during the summer months  we also experience a slight increase in in center business activity with summer programming and operating expenses due to our outdoor aquatics operations 
we experience an increased level of membership attrition during the third and fourth quarters as the summer pool season ends and we enter the holiday season 
this can lead to a sequential decline in memberships during those quarters 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity historically  we have satisfied our liquidity needs through various debt arrangements  sales of equity and cash flow provided by operations 
our principal liquidity needs have included the development of new centers  debt service requirements and expenditures necessary to maintain and update our existing centers and associated fitness equipment and may include the acquisition and remodeling of centers we acquire from time to time  as well as acquisitions to support our in center and corporate businesses 
we believe that we can satisfy our current and longer term debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements primarily with cash flow from operations  by the extension of the terms of or refinancing our existing debt facilities  through sale leaseback transactions and by continuing to raise long term debt or equity capital  although there can be no assurance that such actions can or will be completed 
in the second quarter of  we retired mortgage debt scheduled to mature in july we also amended  enlarged and extended our revolving credit facility  previously scheduled to mature in may  now scheduled to mature on june  we expect to use the proceeds from the amended revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes  future center expansion and to help fund other growth initiatives 
our business model operates with negative working capital primarily for three reasons 
first  we carry minimal accounts receivable due to our ability to have monthly membership dues paid by electronic draft 
second  we defer enrollment fee revenue 
third  we fund the construction of our new centers under standard arrangements with our vendors that are paid with cash flows from operations or the revolving credit facility 
credit rating 
we have never had public debt 
we have never requested or received a credit rating from standard and poor s rating services or moody s investor service

investing activities investing activities consist primarily of purchasing real property  constructing new centers  acquisitions and purchasing new fitness equipment

we plan to fund these capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million used in financing activities for the year ended december  the change of million was primarily due to the prepayment of mortgage notes payable  as discussed below

contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total after in thousands long term debt obligations  excluding capital lease obligations capital lease obligations interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations other obligations total contractual obligations see footnote  long term debt to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
interest expense obligations were calculated holding floating rate debt balances and interest rates constant at december  rates 
purchase obligations consist primarily of our contracts with construction subcontractors for the completion of the four large format centers under construction as of december   three of which we plan to open in  as well as contracts for the purchase of land 
all construction subcontracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate any project 
therefore  we have the ability to cancel any project and  in the event of such a cancellation  we will only be obligated to pay for work actually performed up to the date of cancellation 
other obligations consists of deferred compensation obligations and payments owed in connection with certain acquisitions 
in addition to the other long term liabilities presented in the table above  approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables effective for us in fiscal the guidance revises the criteria for measuring and allocating consideration to each component of a multiple deliverable arrangement 
the guidance requires companies to allocate revenue using the relative selling price of each deliverable  which must be estimated if the company does not have either a history of selling the deliverable on a standalone basis or third party evidence of selling price 
the implementation of the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance on goodwill impairment testing 
the guidance is effective for us in fiscal  although early adoption is permitted 
the guidance allows companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the guidance also includes examples of the types of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
we do not expect the implementation of the guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and  therefore  impact our consolidated cash flows and consolidated results of operations 
as of december   our net floating rate indebtedness was approximately million 
if long term floating interest rates were to have increased by basis points during the year ended december   our interest costs would have increased by approximately million 
if short term interest rates were to have increased by basis points during the year ended december   our interest income from cash equivalents would have increased by less than million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our floating rate indebtedness and cash equivalents balances at december
