risk factors 
management overview blue nile is the leading online retailer of high quality diamonds and fine jewelry 
we offer our products for sale through the bluenile 
com  bluenile 
ca and bluenile 
co 
uk websites in over countries and territories throughout the world 
our primary focus is on growing our business by providing unparalleled value to consumers and delivering exceptional customer service 
our online business model allows us to avoid many of the costs that are typically incurred by physical retail stores 
as a result  we are able to realize lower gross profit margins while remaining profitable 
our lower gross profit margins result from lower retail prices that we offer to our customers 
we believe that these lower prices provide a compelling value to consumers that will result in increasing our sales and market share 
our long term financial focus is primarily on sustainable growth in free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure 
non gaap free cash flow is primarily driven by increasing our operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures 
increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites  improvements in operating margins and the efficient management of operating costs  offset by the investments that we make in longer term strategic initiatives 
differentiating factors and value proposition our innovative business model is designed to deliver exceptional value and service to customers 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived through sales of engagement rings or jewelry products that feature a diamond 
we have developed relationships with a large number of diamond suppliers with whom we have exclusive agreements as an online retailer 
this allows us to offer our customers access to a large selection of high quality diamonds through our websites that we are not holding in inventory 
in most cases  we purchase diamonds from our suppliers only as our customers place orders with us 
as a result  we do not incur the significant costs that would be incurred by physical retail stores to carry high levels of diamond inventory 
our efficient operating model also provides for negative working capital benefits  since payments are received from customers within a few days of shipment of their order  but our vendor payment terms are typically in the day range 
in addition to the working capital benefits of our model  the significant volume of diamonds that we purchase enhances our ability to buy from our suppliers at the best and lowest prices 
we are able to pass these lower costs on to consumers  further increasing our value proposition 
focus on growth we believe that increasing our brand awareness and acquiring new customers will continue to drive growth 
our core business is engagement rings 
in  our engagement products delivered of our revenue 
the value  quality and extensive selection of diamonds that we offer for sale are key differentiators that we believe give us an advantage over our competitors 
in  we significantly increased the breadth and depth of non engagement jewelry products offered for sale on our websites 
the product expansion included more fashion oriented products in a wider range of price points to appeal to a broader audience and spur revenue growth 
the products that we offer for sale are exclusive to blue nile  consistent with our goal of building a distinctive and aspirational brand 
in  we significantly increased our investment in marketing to drive growth and increase our brand awareness 
in addition to our traditional online marketing efforts  we diversified our marketing through such 
table of contents avenues as daily deal promotions  product viewing events  television advertising and public relations events  to name a few 
our marketing efforts have been successful in bringing in new customers 
we plan to continue increasing our investment in marketing as a way to expand our customer base and drive growth 
our investment in international markets is also a significant driver of growth 
in  we increased our online marketing efforts  expanded our product assortment and added foreign language capabilities in customer service 
additionally  we launched a local language website in simplified chinese 
our international business remains a key strategic focus and we plan to continue expansion of our product offerings  localization efforts and other initiatives to drive growth 
trends we believe that our financial results for fiscal year were negatively impacted by increases in the commodity prices underlying our products and the continuing macroeconomic conditions in the united states and abroad 
diamond prices increased rapidly in the first half of to historical levels 
prices decreased in the second half of the year  but remained significantly higher year over year 
prices for platinum  gold and silver also increased significantly in we believe that the significant increases in prices negatively impacted demand for our products 
additionally  high levels of unemployment in the united states  low consumer confidence  economic volatility abroad and various other factors affected consumer spending in  including the sale of luxury products such as diamonds and fine jewelry 
despite these external conditions  we were able to grow our sales in by compared to  while remaining profitable 
we believe that the value we offer to consumers  our broad selection  and our focus on exceptional service will continue to resonate with consumers and lead to further growth in our business 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make certain estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following are the critical accounting policies that we believe require significant estimation and management judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue and the related gross profit on the date on which ownership passes from blue nile to our customers 
for customers in the us  canada and the us  ownership passes at the time the package is received by the customer 
for customers in other locations  ownership passes at the time the product is shipped 
as we require customer payment prior to order shipment  any payments received prior to the transfer of ownership are not recorded as revenue 
for us  canadian and eu shipments  we utilize our freight vendors tracking information to determine when delivery has occurred  which is typically within one to three days after shipment 
we reduce revenue by a provision for returns  which is estimated based on our historical product return rates and current economic conditions 
our contracts with our suppliers generally allow us to return diamonds purchased and returned by our customers 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation at fair value 
we use the black scholes merton option valuation model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term and the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term expected volatility 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of employee stock options and consequently  the related amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents we performed the following sensitivity analysis using changes in the expected term and expected volatility that could be reasonably possible in the near term 
if we assumed a six month increase or decrease in the expected term or a basis point increase or decrease in expected volatility  the value of a newly granted hypothetical stock option would increase decrease by the following percentages increase decrease expected term expected volatility sensitivity to change in assumptions was determined using the black scholes merton valuation model compared to the following original assumptions stock price and exercise price equal to the closing market price of blue nile  inc common stock on december   expected term of years  expected volatility of  expected dividend yield of and a risk free interest rate of 
in addition  we estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize stock based compensation expense for grants that are expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
to the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate  stock based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
results of operations the following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales year ended january  year ended january  year ended january  net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other income  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income the following describes certain items set forth in our consolidated statements of operations net sales 
substantially all of our net sales consist of diamonds and fine jewelry sold via the internet  net of estimated returns 
historically  net sales have been higher in the fourth quarter as a result of higher consumer spending during the holiday season 
we expect this seasonal trend to continue in the foreseeable future 
gross profit 
our gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold to customers  inbound and outbound shipping costs  depreciation on assembly related assets  insurance on shipments and the costs incurred to set diamonds into ring  earring and pendant settings  including labor and related facilities costs 
our gross profit has fluctuated historically and we expect it to continue to fluctuate based primarily on our product acquisition costs  product mix and pricing decisions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related benefit costs for our employees  stock based compensation  marketing costs and credit card fees 
these expenses also include certain facility related costs  and fulfillment  customer service  technology and depreciation expenses  as well as professional fees and other general corporate expenses

sales of our non engagement jewelry grew at a rate above our overall sales growth rate 
net sales in the us increased by to million in compared with million in the prior year 
us non engagement sales grew due to expansion of our product assortment that commenced in mid and increased marketing efforts 
us engagement sales declined for the year  attributed to significant increases in diamond prices in the first half of that negatively impacted demand for our engagement products 
although diamond prices stabilized in the second half of  costs of certain of our more popular diamond sizes and shapes were to higher at january  than at january  international sales increased to million for the year ended january   compared with million for the year ended january   due primarily to increased marketing efforts 
the strength of foreign currencies against the us dollar also contributed to international sales growth 
internally  we monitor our international sales performance on a non gaap basis which eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into us dollars constant exchange rate basis 
international sales growth was positively impacted by approximately due to changes in foreign exchange rates in compared with the rates in effect during excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates  international sales increased in the year ended january  
table of contents gross profit gross profit increased million or in the year ended january  compared with the year ended january  the increase in gross profit is due to the increase in net sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in the year ended january  compared with in the year ended january  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin percent is attributable to increases in diamond and precious metals costs and increased promotional activity 
as noted above  the cost of diamonds increased significantly in precious metals costs also increased significantly in these cost increases were not fully passed on to our customers  which lowered our gross margin percentages 
additionally  in order to spur sales  we increased our marketing promotions  which impacted net revenue and our gross margin percentage 
generally  we purchase our diamonds on a real time basis from our suppliers when a customer places an order for a specific diamond 
in periods of rapidly rising prices  the value that we are able to provide to customers and or our gross margin percent may decrease 
costs for our non engagement jewelry products are impacted by prices for diamonds and precious metals  including gold  platinum and silver  which rise and fall based upon global supply and demand dynamics 
in making retail pricing decisions  we take into account fluctuations in the pricing of diamonds and precious metals  which in turn  affect the gross margin that we realize from such products 
while prices for diamonds and precious metals will continue to fluctuate based upon supply and demand  we cannot adequately predict the amount and timing of any such fluctuations 
we expect that gross profit will fluctuate in the future based on changes in product acquisition costs  particularly diamond prices  product mix and pricing decisions 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended january  compared with million in the year ended january  due to several factors 
marketing and advertising costs increased million  primarily due to increased spending on online marketing vehicles  public relations  promotional activities such as daily deals and other marketing activities to drive new customer acquisition and increase brand awareness 
compensation and benefits expenses increased million due to increased headcount to support key business initiatives  partially offset by lower year over year incentive bonus accruals

year over year sales trends started strong in the first quarter but slowed down considerably in the third quarter as us consumers pulled back on spending over concerns about high unemployment rates  limited access to credit and other macroeconomic factors

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we are primarily funded by our cash flows from operations 
the significant components of our working capital are inventory and liquid assets such as cash  cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable  reduced by accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our business model provides certain beneficial working capital characteristics 
while we collect cash from sales to customers within several business days of the related sale  we typically have extended payment terms with our suppliers 
a significant portion of the products that we offer for sale are diamonds and fine jewelry that is made with precious metals and diamonds 
the prices of diamonds and precious metals increased significantly in also  recessionary economic cycles  investment and credit market conditions and volatility  unemployment levels and other economic factors impact consumer spending patterns 
we believe that our revenue  gross margins  cash flows from operations  and net income were negatively impacted by diamond and precious metal price increases and macroeconomic conditions in  and may continue to be impacted in the future 
our liquidity is primarily dependent upon our net cash from operating activities 
our net cash from operating activities is sensitive to many factors  including changes in working capital 
working capital at any specific point in time is dependent upon many variables  including our operating results  seasonality  inventory management and product assortment breadth and depth  the timing of cash receipts and payments  and vendor payment terms 
as of january   working capital totaled million  including cash and cash equivalents of million and inventory of million  offset by accounts payable and accrued liabilities totaling million

the net increase in trade payables totaled million for the fiscal year ended january  compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  we experience greater cash flow from operations in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due to the significant increase in revenue from our holiday sales 
in the first quarter we typically have a significant pay down of our accounts payable balance that was accumulated during the fourth quarter holiday season 
trade payables did not increase as much in the fiscal year ended january  as in the fiscal year ended january  due to the working capital dynamics of our business model associated with the sales decline in the fourth quarter and the resulting slower than historical build up of accounts payable 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the year ended january  was also attributable to lower net income and the decrease in tax benefits realized upon the exercise of stock options 
the net tax benefit realized from stock option exercises  which represent the tax deductions in excess of stock compensation expense recorded in the financial statements  decreased to million in the fiscal year ended january   from million in the fiscal year ended january  due to the number of stock options exercised and the market price of our common stock

over the next months  we do not expect purchases of property and equipment to exceed our historic levels 
net cash of million used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended january  related primarily to the repurchase of common stock
