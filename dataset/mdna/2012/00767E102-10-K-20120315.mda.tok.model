item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes 
in addition to historical information  some of the information in this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations and involves risk and uncertainties 
for example  statements regarding our plans and strategy for our business  our expectations with respect to future financial performance  expense categories and levels  cash needs and liquidity sources are forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under the risk factors in part i  item a of this form k 
overview we are an emerging biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel  life altering therapeutics to treat debilitating and often fatal rare diseases 
our initial focus is on therapeutics to treat severe inherited lipid disorders 
lipids are naturally occurring molecules  such as cholesterol and triglycerides  which are transported in the blood 
elevated levels of cholesterol  or hypercholesterolemia  and elevated levels of triglycerides  or hypertriglyceridemia  can dramatically increase the risk of experiencing a potentially life threatening cardiovascular event or other serious medical issue  such as a heart attack or stroke in the case of hypercholesterolemia or acute pancreatitis in the case of hypertriglyceridemia 
we are initially developing our first product candidate  lomitapide  as an oral  once a day treatment for patients with a rare inherited lipid disorder called homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  or hofh 
these patients are at very high risk of experiencing life threatening cardiovascular events as a result of extremely elevated cholesterol levels in the blood  and as a result  have a substantially reduced life span relative to unaffected individuals 
in the first quarter of  we submitted a new drug application  or nda  to the united states food and drug administration  or fda  and a marketing authorization application  or maa  to the european medicines agency  or ema  requesting approval to market lomitapide as an adjunct to a low fat diet and other lipid lowering therapies  to reduce cholesterol in patients with hofh 
based on meetings with the fda and ema  we submitted the nda and maa using the week results from our week pivotal phase iii trial of lomitapide in the treatment of adult patients with hofh 
the week results of the trial were announced in may  we completed the trial in late  and in january   we announced the week results of the trial which were consistent with the week results 
we are a development stage company with a limited operating history 
to date  we have primarily focused on developing our lead compound  lomitapide 
we have funded our operations to date primarily from the private placement of convertible preferred stock  convertible debt  venture debt and the proceeds from our initial public offering  or ipo  and our follow on public offering  or fpo 
from inception through december   we received proceeds of million from the sale of convertible preferred stock  million from the sale of convertible debt and million from venture debt 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our ipo selling  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net cash proceeds from the ipo were approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses payable by us 
in connection with the closing of the ipo  all of our shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding at the time of the offering were automatically converted into  shares of common stock and all of our convertible promissory notes were automatically converted to  shares of common stock 
on june   we completed our fpo selling  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
certain selling stockholders also sold  common shares at per share 
net proceeds received by us after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses payable by us were approximately million 
on july   the underwriters exercised their overallotment option to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at an offering price of per share 
certain selling stockholders also sold  shares of common stock at per share 
net proceeds received by us in connection with the exercise of the overallotment option after deducting underwriting fees and offering expenses payable by us were approximately million 

table of contents we have incurred losses in each year since our inception in february our net losses were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
substantially all of our operating losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect that our near term efforts will be focused on gaining regulatory approval of lomitapide in hofh  including in international markets  launching lomitapide as a treatment for hofh in the countries in which we receive marketing approval  and developing lomitapide as a treatment for fc 
if  in the future  we elect to develop lomitapide for broader patient populations  such as for those patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  or hefh  who have severely elevated ldl c levels despite current therapies or who are statin intolerant  or for non fc patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia  we would plan to do so selectively either on our own or by establishing alliances with one or more pharmaceutical company collaborators  depending on  among other factors  the applicable indications  the related development costs and our available resources 
in addition  in the long term  after we achieve our goals with respect to launch of lomitapide  if approved  we plan to evaluate opportunities to leverage our infrastructure and expertise by acquiring rights to other product candidates targeted at life threatening or substantially debilitating rare diseases 
financial overview revenue to date  we have not generated any revenue from the sale of any products  and we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless or until we obtain marketing approval of and commercialize lomitapide 
research and development expenses since our inception  we have focused on our clinical development programs 
we recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to consultants and contract research organizations  or cros  in conjunction with independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials  including all related fees  such as for investigator grants  patient screening  laboratory work and statistical compilation and analysis  costs related to production of clinical materials  including fees paid to contract manufacturers  costs related to upfront and milestone payments under in licensing agreements  costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements in the united states  the european union and other foreign jurisdictions  consulting fees paid to third parties  and costs related to stock options or other stock based compensation granted to personnel in development functions 
we expense both internal and external development costs as incurred 
we typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across our projects 

table of contents the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands lomitapide implitapide total we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in in connection with our manufacturing validation campaigns  growth within the medical affairs function as we continue to hire key personnel in the united states and europe and the establishment of pharmacovigilance systems for lomitapide 
in addition  we expect to initiate a clinical trial to evaluate lomitapide for the treatment of adult patients with fc 
due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with timing and costs to completion of clinical trials  we cannot determine these future expenses with certainty and the actual range may vary significantly from our forecasts 
our research and development expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development  including  among others the number of trials required for approval  the number of sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patients  the number of patients that participate in the trials  the number of doses that patients receive  the drop out or discontinuation rates of patients  the duration of patient follow up  the number of analyses and tests performed during the trial  the phase of development the product candidate is in  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and cros that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
generally  these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones 
we generally accrue expenses related to clinical trials based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
if timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed  we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis 
we have not received marketing approval for lomitapide from the fda  the ema  or any other foreign regulatory authority 
obtaining marketing approval is an extensive  lengthy  expensive and uncertain process  and the fda  the ema or any other foreign regulatory authority  may delay  limit or deny approval of lomitapide for many reasons 

table of contents as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will receive revenue from the commercialization and sale of lomitapide 
in june  we received notice from the fda of a partial clinical hold with respect to clinical trials of longer than six months duration for our product candidates  lomitapide and implitapide 
at that time  the fda did not apply this partial clinical hold to our pivotal phase iii clinical trial of lomitapide for the treatment of patients with hofh 
the fda removed the partial clinical hold with respect to lomitapide in february  but this partial clinical hold remains in effect with respect to implitapide 
as a result  expenses related to this program have been primarily related to payments under our license agreement with bayer healthcare ag  or bayer 
due to this uncertainty  we are unable to determine the timing of any completion costs related to the implitapide program 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and operational functions  including executive  finance  human resources  it  marketing and legal 
other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services  including legal services and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase with the continued development of lomitapide  activities in anticipation of potential launch of lomitapide  and the commercialization of lomitapide  if approved 
these increases will likely include increased costs for sales and marketing personnel  including sales representatives  and reimbursement case managers  and establishment of our commercial distribution channel for lomitapide 
interest income and interest expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest expense consists primarily of cash and non cash interest costs related to our outstanding debt 
in addition  we capitalize costs incurred in connection with the issuance of debt 
we amortize these costs over the life of our debt agreements as interest expense in our statement of operations 
in february  we entered into the loan and security agreement with the hercules technology ii  lp and hercules technology iii  lp  collectively the hercules funds  for a million credit facility 
at the closing of the loan and security agreement  we received an initial advance of million  with interest only payments for thirteen months 
at any time prior to december   we had the ability to request additional term loan advances in the minimum amount of million  and up to million 
we did not request any additional term loan advances under the loan and security agreement 
net operating losses and tax carryforwards as of december   we had approximately million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million available to offset future taxable income 
these federal and state net operating loss and federal and state tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
the tax reform act of provides for a limitation on the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards following certain ownership changes that could limit our ability to utilize these carryforwards 
we have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred  or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since our inception  due to the significant costs and complexities associated with such study 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned carryforwards may be limited 
additionally  us tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be utilized against future taxes 
as a result  we may not be able to take full advantage of these carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those described below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing in item of this form k  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders  communicating with applicable vendor personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to cros in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials and registration batch materials  and professional service fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and cros that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
we do not anticipate the future settlement of existing accruals to differ materially from our estimates 
valuation of financial instruments valuation of investments we regularly invest excess operating cash in marketable securities consisting of money market funds and notes issued by the us government  as well as fixed income investments and us bond funds  both of which can be 
table of contents readily purchased and sold using established markets 
the carrying amounts of these marketable securities are generally considered to be representative of their respective fair values based upon pricing of securities with similar investment characteristics and holdings 
we believe that the market risk arising from its holdings of these financial instruments is mitigated as many of these securities are either government backed or of the highest credit rating 
we also had an investment in an auction rate security and an auction rate security that was converted into non cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred stock  both of which were sold during september valuing these securities required the use of estimates and assumptions that are subjective 
fair value estimates of these securities are made at a specific point in time  based on relevant market information 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision 
the estimated fair value of the auction rate security was derived through the use of a discounted cash flow model 
our discounted cash flow model considered  among other things  the quality of the underlying collateral  the credit rating of the issuer  an estimate of when these securities were either expected to have a successful auction or otherwise return to par value  the expected interest income to be received over this period and the estimated required rate of return for investors that may be willing to purchase such a security 
we also considered third party valuations  reports and similar securities priced in the marketplace when arriving at the estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value of our auction rate security that was converted to preferred stock was estimated by analyzing similar securities in the marketplace 
we also considered the fair value of the underlying collateral and credit rating of the issuer 
we sold both the investment in the auction rate security and the auction rate security that was converted into preferred stock during preferred stock warrant liability we initially accounted for our preferred stock warrant in accordance with accounting standards codification asc   distinguishing liabilities from equity  which required that a financial instrument  other than an outstanding share  that  at inception  is indexed to an obligation to repurchase the issuer s equity shares  regardless of the timing or likelihood of the redemption  shall be classified as a liability 
we measured the fair value of the warrant liability using an option pricing model with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
any modifications to the warrant liability were recorded in earnings during the period of the modification 
the significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the warrant liability included the strike price  estimate for volatility  risk free interest rate  estimated fair value of the preferred stock  and the estimated life of the warrant 
in connection with our ipo  the warrant became exercisable for shares of our common stock 
in accordance with asc and asc  derivatives and hedging  we reclassifed the warrant liability to additional paid in capital  as the settlement of the warrant is fixed to a specific number of shares of common stock  has no contingency and does not require any cash settlement 
restructuring costs in october  we initiated plans to consolidate facilities and related administrative functions into our cambridge headquarters by the end of the reorganization included a reduction in workforce  closure of a facility and disposal of certain assets 
these restructuring charges were accounted for in accordance with asc  exit or disposal cost obligations and asc  compensation stock compensation 
see results of operations below and note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for a further discussion of the company s restructuring actions 

table of contents stock based compensation we recognize as compensation expense the fair value  for accounting purposes  of stock options  restricted stock awards and other stock based compensation issued to employees 
for service type awards  compensation expense is typically recognized over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
for performance type awards  the compensation expense is recognized beginning in the period when management has determined it is probable the performance factor will be achieved 
equity instruments issued to non employees are recorded at their fair value for accounting purposes 
the compensation expense is recognized as expense over the related service period 
for equity awards that have previously been revalued  any incremental increase in the fair value has been recorded as compensation expense on the date of the modification for vested awards or over the remaining service vesting period for unvested awards 
the incremental compensation cost is the excess of the fair value based measure of the modified award on the date of modification over the fair value based measure of the original award immediately before the modification 
stock based compensation expense includes stock options granted to employees and non employees and has been reported in our statements of operations as follows years ended december  in thousands research and development general and administrative total in addition  restructuring costs contain stock based compensation expense of million related to the acceleration of vesting of certain stock options 
we calculate the fair value of stock based compensation awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including stock price volatility and the expected life of stock options 
as a new public company  we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common stock price or the expected life of our options 
we calculate expected volatility based on reported data for selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies  or guideline peer group  for which the historical information is available 
we will continue to use the guideline peer group volatility information until the historical volatility of our common stock is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
the assumed dividend yield is based on our expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
we determine the average expected life of stock options according to the simplified method as described in staff accounting bulletin  which is the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
we determine the risk free interest rate by reference to implied yields available from five year and seven year us treasury securities with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical analysis of actual stock option forfeitures 
the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model for the years ended december   and are set forth in our financial statements 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate stock based compensation 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee stock based awards is determined using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a market transaction between a willing buyer and willing seller 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions when valuing our options  the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what we have historically reported 

table of contents results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and the following table summarizes the results of our operations for each of the years ended december  and  together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage years ended december  increase decrease costs and expenses research and development general and administrative restructuring costs total costs and expenses loss from operations interest expense interest income change in fair value of warrant liability other than temporary impairment on securities other income  net loss before income taxes benefit from income taxes net loss revenue we did not recognize any revenue for the year ended december  or the year ended december  research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased expenses related to our lomitapide development program  including a million increase in clinical monitoring costs  a million increase in clinical consultant expense  a million increase in compensation costs  a million increase in clinical trial supplies and a million increase in pre clinical expenses 
in addition stock based compensation expense increased million 
these increases are due to the advancement of the clinical development program for lomitapide as well as the advancement of the regulatory work and related preparations for the filing of our nda and maa for lomitapide 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in in connection with our manufacturing validation campaign  growth within the medical affairs function as we continue to hire in the united states and europe and the establishment of pharmacovigilance systems for lomitapide 
in addition  we expect to initiate a clinical trial to evaluate lomitapide for the treatment of adult patients with fc 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily due to increases of million in stock based compensation expense  million in professional services expenses  million in compensation costs  and million for facility related expenses 
these increases are mainly due to building out our management team and related stock based compensation costs  as well as the costs associated with operating as a public company 
we expect general and administrative costs to continue to increase during 
table of contents as we hire sales and marketing personnel  including sales representatives and case managers and conduct other activities in anticipation of potential commercialization of lomitapide  including developing our patient tracker system  creating disease awareness in the physician community and developing a price value dossier 
these increases primarily will include increased costs related to additional personnel  primarily in sales and marketing  as we commence pre commercial launch activities 
restructuring costs restructuring costs of million in were related to the closure of our bedminster  new jersey facility 
in october  we initiated plans to consolidate facilities and related administrative functions into our cambridge headquarters by the end of as a result  we closed our bedminster  new jersey office effective december  and reduced headcount by five positions 
included in the restructuring charges are million of employee severance and outplacement services costs for five employees  primarily in general and administrative positions  million representing the net present value of the remaining lease obligation for our bedminster  new jersey facility and a net write off of million of fixed assets  primarily computer equipment and leasehold improvements  that were no longer in use after vacating the facility 
we will expense million in additional severance benefits over the remaining service periods of each employee through june  in addition  we accelerated the vesting of  total stock options granted in  and to the former employees upon the termination of their employment 
as such  we recognized expense related to those stock options based on the fair value of the stock options at the date of the modification of each award 
we will expense the value of the modification over the remaining service periods for each of the employees 
we recorded million of non cash restructuring charges related to these modifications in  and expect to record an additional million of non cash restructuring charges related to these modifications through june  in january  we entered into a sublease agreement for the bedminster  new jersey facility for the remaining term of the lease 
in determining the ongoing facilities charge  we considered our sublease arrangement for the facility  including sublease terms and the sublease rates 
we will record ongoing restructuring charges of approximately  related to the remaining lease obligation through july interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million decrease was primarily due to the write off of non cash deferred financing fees associated with the conversion of our preferred stock and convertible notes into shares of common stock at the closing of our ipo in interest income interest income was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase was due to higher cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances subsequent to our ipo and fpo 
change in fair value of warrant liability we recorded million of other expense during the year ended december  due to the revaluation of our preferred stock warrant to fair value prior to its conversion to a warrant to purchase common stock upon the closing of our ipo

the expenses related to our lomitapide development program were higher during primarily due to costs associated with clinical study work 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase in was due to an increase in stock compensation expense of million  recruiting and public relations fees of million  outside consultant fees of million  legal expenses of million and other related expenses of million 

table of contents interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the write off of non cash deferred financing fees associated with the conversion of our preferred stock and convertible notes into shares of common stock at the closing of our ipo  and repayment of debt owed under our old hercules loan agreement 
interest income interest income was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million decrease was due to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances during the year ended december  change in fair value of warrant liability we recorded million of other expense during the year ended december   compared with other expense of million during the year ended december  in  the expense was due to the revaluation of our preferred stock warrant to fair value prior to its conversion to a warrant to purchase common stock upon the closing of our ipo

the net cash used in operating activities decreased in as a result of lower development expenses as the company concentrated its resources on its phase iii clinical trial activities and  due to cash constraints  extended its payment terms with vendors 
the net cash used in operating activities increased in as a result of increased development costs related to our pivotal phase iii trial of lomitapide for the treatment of patients with hofh and increased costs related to seeking to obtain marketing approval for lomitapide in this indication  including our completion of studies and trials required prior to the filing of our nda and maa for lomitapide

future funding requirements we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and to develop and commercialize lomitapide 
our future capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors  including the decisions of the fda and ema with respect to our applications for marketing approval of lomitapide for the treatment of patients with hofh in the united states and the european union  the costs of activities related to the regulatory approval process  and the timing of approvals  if received  the timing and cost of our anticipated clinical trial of lomitapide for the treatment of adult patients with fc  the timing and cost of an anticipated clinical trial to evaluate lomitapide for treatment of pediatric and adolescent patients to years of age with hofh  and the cost and timing of such a trial  the cost of putting in place the sales and marketing capabilities necessary to be prepared for a potential commercial launch of lomitapide in hofh  if approved  the cost of filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  the costs of our manufacturing related activities  the costs associated with commercializing lomitapide if we receive marketing approval  and subject to receipt of marketing approval  the levels  timing and collection of revenue received from sales of approved products  if any  in the future 
in november  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  which became effective in december this shelf registration statement permits us to offer  from time to time  any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants of up to an aggregate of million 
we currently have not issued any securities under this shelf registration statement 
we may also pursue opportunities to obtain additional external financing in the future through debt financing  lease arrangements related to facilities and capital equipment  collaborative research and development agreements  and license agreements 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned development  sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
the source  timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon equity and debt market conditions  interest rates and  more specifically  on our continued progress in our regulatory  development and commercial activities  and the extent of our commercial success 
there can be no assurance that external funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to date  we have not generated any revenue from our development stage product candidates 
we do not know when  or if  we will generate any revenue 
we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless or until we obtain marketing approval of  and commercialize  lomitapide 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to cover our cash flow requirements through mid 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships
