payroll and related costs for our fiscal year increased  or to  from  for our fiscal year due primarily to an increase in the florida minimum wage  which was effective january   and to increases in payroll taxes  including unemployment taxes

occupancy costs consisting of rent  common area maintenance  repairs  real property taxes and amortization of leasehold interests for our fiscal year increased  or to  from  for our fiscal year our occupancy costs increased primarily due to increasing percentage rents at various locations and due to rental payments for the new restaurant location in miami  florida acquired by a limited partnership  which commenced january   partially offset by the elimination of rent from a limited partnership owned restaurant located in the shopping center in miami  florida which we purchased during the first quarter of our fiscal year and the elimination of rent paid for our combination restaurant and package liquor store located at biscayne boulevard  north miami  florida  the real property and building of which we purchased during the first quarter of our fiscal year we anticipate that our occupancy costs will remain stable throughout our fiscal year as rental payments for the new restaurant location in miami  florida  will be offset by the reduction in rental payments as a result of our purchase of the building on november  where store is located

interest expense for our fiscal year increased  to  from  for our fiscal year interest expense increased during our fiscal year primarily due to the interest paid on the million mortgage loan  the proceeds of which we used to purchase a shopping center in miami  florida and a million term loan the proceeds of which were also ultimately used to purchase the shopping center  while permitting us to retain our working capital and cash reserves 
net income attributable to stockholders 
net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year decreased  or to  from  for our fiscal year as a percentage of sales  net income for our fiscal year is  as compared to in our fiscal year during our fiscal year  we recognized income of  offset by income tax of  from the sale of our interest  as guarantor  of a nine year leasehold interest 
without giving effect to the above non recurring item  our net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year would have increased  or to  for our fiscal year 
table of contents new limited partnership restaurants as new restaurants open  our income from operations will be adversely affected due to our obligation to fund pre opening costs  including but not limited to pre opening rent for the new locations 
during our fiscal year  we recognized pre opening rent expense in the approximate amount of  for the miami  florida restaurant which opened for business on december  during our fiscal year  we did not have a new restaurant location in the development stage and did not recognize any pre opening rent 
we are recognizing rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
during our fiscal year  the limited partnership restaurant in miami  florida which opened for business on december   reported losses of  primarily due to pre opening costs  thus contributing to a reduction in the operating income for our fiscal year during our fiscal year  we did not have a new restaurant location in the development stage and did not recognize any pre opening costs 
we believe that our current cash on hand  together with our expected cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
trends during the next twelve months  we expect that our restaurant food and bar sales will increase  but gross profit for restaurant food and bar sales will decrease due to higher food costs  including our cost of poultry  offset by a decrease in our cost of ribs during calendar year we anticipate that our package liquor store sales and gross profit margin for package liquor store sales will stabilize during our fiscal year we expect higher food costs and higher overall expenses to adversely affect our net income 
we also plan to continue our increased advertising to attract and retain our customers against increased competition 
with our recent menu price increases  we plan to limit further menu price increases as long as possible  but continue to face increased competition and expect higher food costs and higher overall expenses  which will adversely affect our net income 
we may be required to raise menu prices wherever competitively possible 
we currently have a new restaurant in the development stage  which opened for business on december  using our limited partnership ownership model 
we continue to search for new locations to open restaurants and thereby expand our business 
any new locations will likely be opened using our limited partnership ownership model 
we are not actively searching for locations for the operation of new package liquor stores  but if an appropriate location for a package liquor store becomes available  we will consider it 
liquidity and capital resources we fund our operations through our cash on hand and positive cash flow from operations 
as of september   we had cash of approximately  an increase of  from our cash balance of  as of october  the increase in cash as of september  was primarily due to a balance of  of net proceeds from the private sale of limited partnership interests by the affiliated limited partnership which owns the new miami  florida restaurant and opened for business on december  management believes that the company s current cash availability from its cash on hand and the expected cash from operations will be sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months

all of our owned units require periodic refurbishing in order to remain competitive 
the cost of this refurbishment in our fiscal year was  for renovations to one existing company owned restaurant and for renovations to three limited partnership owned restaurants

off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of the end of our fiscal year or our fiscal year critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements estimated useful lives of property and equipment the estimates of useful lives for property and equipment are significant estimates 
expenditures for the leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is first constructed are material 
in addition  periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material 
we estimate the useful life of those assets by considering  among other things  expected use  life of the lease on the building  and warranty period  if applicable 
the assets are then depreciated using a straight line method over those estimated lives 
these estimated lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary 
any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary

we currently have one restaurant under development in miami  florida which will result in us operating the restaurant as general partner 
this new restaurant opened for business on december  additionally  we expect that any expansion which takes place in opening additional new restaurants will also result in us operating the restaurants as general partner 
in addition to the general partnership interest we also purchase limited partnership units ranging from to of the total units outstanding 
as a result of these controlling interests  we consolidate the operations of these limited partnerships with ours despite the fact that we do not own in excess of of the equity interests 
all intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
the noncontrolling interests in the earnings of these limited partnerships are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share
