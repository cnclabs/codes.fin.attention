revenues we generate a substantial portion of our revenues on a per transaction basis  most of which is derived from contracts that extend up to months from execution 
for the years ended december  and  we derived approximately and  respectively  of our revenues from transactions processed and subscription arrangements 
the remainder of our revenues was generated by professional services and licenses 
historically  our revenues have been directly impacted by the number of transactions processed 
in recent years  the fourth quarter has had the highest volume of transactions processed due to increased consumer activation activity during the holiday season 
the future success of our business depends on the continued growth of consumer and business transactions and  as such  the volume of transactions that we process could fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
see current trends affecting our results of operations for certain matters regarding future results of operations 
all of our revenues are substantially recorded in the us dollar but as we continue to expand our footprint with international carriers and increase the extent of recording our international activities in local currencies we will become subject to currency translation risk that could affect our future net sales 
we currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from one customer  at t 
for the year ended december   at t accounted for approximately of our revenues  compared to for the year ended december  our agreement with at t was automatically renewed in through december of and will automatically renew each year unless either party notifies the other of its intention not to renew at least sixty days prior to the end of the then current term 
this agreement defines the work activities  transaction pricing  forecasting process  service level agreements and remedies associated with certain services performed by us for at t s ecommerce organization 
the agreement provides for at t to pay us i a monthly hosting fee  ii a fee based on the number of transactions processed through our technology platform  iii a fee based on manual processing services and iv fees for professional services rendered by us

costs and expenses our costs and expenses consist of cost of services  research and development  selling  general and administrative  depreciation and amortization  change in contingent consideration and interest and other expense 

table of contents cost of services includes all direct materials  direct labor  cost of facilities and those indirect costs related to revenues such as indirect labor  materials and supplies 
our primary cost of services is related to our information technology and systems department  including network costs  data center maintenance  database management and data processing costs  as well as personnel costs associated with service implementation  customer deployment and customer care 
also included in cost of services are costs associated with our exception handling centers and the maintenance of those centers 
currently  we utilize a combination of employees and third party providers to process transactions through these centers 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred unless they meet gaap criteria for deferral and amortization 
software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility do not meet these criteria  and are expensed as incurred 
research and development expense consists primarily of costs related to personnel  including salaries and other personnel related expenses  consulting fees and the cost of facilities  computer and support services used in service technology development 
we also expense costs relating to developing modifications and minor enhancements of our existing technology and services 
selling  general and administrative expense consists of personnel costs including salaries  sales commissions  sales operations and other personnel related expense  travel and related expense  trade shows  costs of communications equipment and support services  facilities costs  consulting fees and costs of marketing programs  such as internet and print

amortization relates to the trademarks  customer lists and technology acquired from wisor in and from fusionone in net change in contingent consideration obligation consists of the changes to the fair value estimate of the obligation to the fusionone and sks former equity holders 
the estimate was based on the weighted probability achievements of certain financial targets for the period from july  through december  on april  we executed a settlement and amendment agreement with the fusionone equity holders  including existing employees  which included a determination of the aggregate earn out amount and the earn out payment dates 
as a result of this agreement the company paid approximately million in cash and issued approximately thousand shares of stock valued at the closing market price at the date of settlement during we will also pay approximately million during q as a result of this agreement 
interest and other expense consist of interest on our lease financing obligations  foreign currency transaction losses and other non operating expenses 
current trends affecting our results of operations our on demand business model enables delivery of our proprietary solutions over the web as a service and has been driven by market trends such as various forms of device activations  order provisioning  local and mobile number portability  the implementation of new technologies  subscriber growth  competitive churn  network changes  growth of the emerging device market ie  smartphones  tablets  connected consumer electronics devices  etc  need for cloud based content back up and synchronization  and universal connectivity platform for all connected devices and consolidations in the industry 
in particular  the emergence of order provisioning of e commerce transactions for smartphone devices  wireless  voip  l mnp  and other communication services surrounding the convergence of bundled services  as well as the recent cooperative activities between cable msos and wireless carriers have increased the need for our services and we believe will continue to be a source of growth for us 
new and emerging players looking to offer wireless services also look towards us as a source of knowledge and technology 

table of contents to support our expected growth driven by the favorable industry trends mentioned above  we continue to look for opportunities to improve our operating efficiencies  such as the utilization of offshore technical and non technical resources for our exception handling center management as well as routine software maintenance activities 
we believe that these opportunities will continue to provide future benefits and position us to support revenue growth 
in addition  we anticipate further automation of the transactions generated by our more mature customers and additional transaction types 
our cost of services can fluctuate from period to period based upon the level of automation and the on boarding of new transaction types 
we continue to advance our plans for the expansion of our platforms footprint with international carriers to support connected devices and multiple networks through our focus on transaction management and cloud based services for back up and synchronization 
our initiatives with at t  verizon wireless  vodafone and other csps continue to grow along with our account presence with connected device oem s 
we are also exploring additional opportunities through merger and acquisition activities to support our customer  product and geographic diversification strategies 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a fiscal period 
the securities and exchange commission sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report on form k 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  correct and reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
see risk factors for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue we provide services principally on a transactional basis or  at times  on a fixed fee basis and recognize the revenues as the services are performed or delivered as discussed below transactional and subscription service arrangements transaction and subscription revenues represented approximately   and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
transaction and subscription revenues consist of revenues derived from the processing of transactions through our service platforms  providing enterprise portal management services on a subscription basis and maintenance agreements on software licenses 
transaction service arrangements include services such as equipment orders  new account set up and activation  number port requests  credit checks and inventory management 
transaction revenues are principally based on a contractual price per transaction and are recognized based on the number of transactions processed during each reporting period 
revenues are 
table of contents recorded based on the total number of transactions processed at the applicable price established in the relevant contract 
the total amount of revenues recognized is based primarily on the volume of transactions 
subscription revenues are recorded on a straight line basis over the life of the contract for subscription services and maintenance contracts 
many of our contracts guarantee minimum volume transactions from the customer 
in these instances  if the customer s total transaction volume for the period is less than the contractual amount  we record revenues at the minimum guaranteed amount 
at times  transaction revenues may also include billings to customers based on the number of individuals dedicated to processing transactions 
set up fees for transactional service arrangements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract since these amounts would not have been paid by the customer without the related transactional service arrangement 
revenues are presented net of discounts  which are volume level driven  or credits  which are performance driven  and are determined in the period in which the volume thresholds are met or the services are provided 
professional service arrangements professional service revenues represented approximately   and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
professional services  when sold with non software transactional service arrangements  are accounted for separately when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis 
professional services  when sold with software transactional service arrangements  are accounted for separately when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the professional services 
when accounted for separately  professional service revenues are recognized on a monthly basis  as services are performed and all other elements of revenue recognition have been satisfied 
in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from transaction service revenues  we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the professional services from other vendors  whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists of the undelivered elements  the nature of the professional services  the timing of when the professional contract was signed in comparison to the transaction service start date and the contractual independence of the transactional service from the professional services 
if a professional service arrangement were not to qualify for separate accounting  we would recognize the professional service revenues ratably over the remaining term of the transaction contract 
software license arrangements software license arrangements represented approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively and primarily related to our network address book software  a component part of our convergencenow plus tm platform which we acquired from fusionone 
we recognize revenues when the license is delivered to our customers 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we allocate the total arrangement consideration among the various elements using the residual method 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements of the arrangement  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of the arrangement 
judgment is also involved in determining whether vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements exists 
such judgments can impact the amount of revenue that we record in a given period 
on january   we prospectively adopted accounting rules that changed the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the new rules changed the application of the residual method of allocation and require that the arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionally to each deliverable on 
table of contents the basis of each deliverable s selling price 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
the adoption of the amended revenue recognition rules did not change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions 
it also did not significantly change how we allocated the arrangement consideration to the various units of accounting or the timing of revenue 
the impact of our adoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we determine vsoe for each element based on historical stand alone sales to third parties 
when we are unable to establish selling prices using vsoe or tpe  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine esp by considering multiple factors  including  but not limited to  geographies  market conditions  competitive landscape  internal costs  gross margin objectives  and pricing practices 
esp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings 
while we follow specific and detailed rules and guidelines related to revenue recognition  we make and use management judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any reporting period  particularly in the areas described above  as well as collectability 
if management made different estimates or judgments  differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue could occur 
deferred revenue deferred revenues primarily represent billings to customers for services in advance of the performance of services  with revenues recognized as the services are rendered  and also include the fair value of deferred revenues recorded as a result of acquisitions 
service level standards pursuant to certain contracts  we are subject to service level standards and to corresponding penalties for failure to meet those standards 
all performance related penalties are reflected as a corresponding reduction of our revenues 
these penalties  if applicable  are recorded in the month incurred and were not significant for the years ended december   and allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated bad debts resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the amount of the allowance account is based on historical experience and our analysis of the accounts receivable balance outstanding 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit losses that we have in the past or that our reserves will be adequate 
if the financial condition of one of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in its inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional expense in the period that this determination was made 
income taxes we account for the effects of income taxes that result from our activities during the current and preceding years 
under this method  deferred income tax liabilities and assets are based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

table of contents as of december   and we had total unrecognized tax benefit reserves of thousand and thousand which includes thousand and thousand for accumulated interest related to uncertain positions  respectively 
components of the reserve are classified as either current or long term in the consolidated balance sheet based on when we expect each of the items to be settled 
accordingly  we recorded a long term liability for unrecognized tax benefits of thousand on the balance sheet at december  that would reduce the effective tax rate if recognized 
we did not have a short term liability on the balance sheet at december  we record interest and penalties accrued in relation to uncertain income tax positions below the operating income line as a component of interest expense 
tax returns for years and thereafter are subject to future examination by tax authorities 
in  the net decrease in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits was thousand and the net decrease for interest benefit was thousand 
we expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during fiscal year  however  we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
while we believe we have identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve we have established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances  it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved 
it is also possible that changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of our tax reserves 
stock based compensation as of december   we maintain three stock based compensation plans 
compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted and is based on the grant date fair value estimated using the weighted average assumption of the black scholes option pricing models 
the equity instrument is not considered to be issued until the instrument vests 
as a result  compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period with an offsetting credit to additional paid in capital 
compensation expense also includes the amortization on a straight line basis over the remaining vesting period of the intrinsic values of the stock options granted prior to for our performance restricted stock awards we estimate the number of shares the recipient is to receive by applying a probability of achieving the performance goals 
the actual number of shares the recipient receives is determined at the end of the annual performance period based on the results achieved versus goals based on our annual performance targets  such as operating income 
once the number of awards is determined  the compensation cost is fixed and continues to be recognized using the accelerated attribution recognition over the requisite service period 
in addition  certain employees from our acquisition of fusionone are eligible to receive contingent earn out payments 
the share portion of the earn out is recorded as stock based compensation expense and is recorded over the performance period when it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved 
this compensation cost will be fixed at the end of the earn out period  and therefore  is subject to volatility based on our stock price 
we classify benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow with a corresponding operating cash outflow 
we included million  million and thousand of excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
expected volatility was calculated based on our historical information of our stock 
the average expected life was determined using historical stock option exercise activity 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to 
table of contents the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common or preferred equity and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
forfeitures are estimated based on the historical analysis of actual option forfeitures 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model are as follows for the year ended december  expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate expected life of options in years expected dividend yield the weighted average fair value as of the date of grant of the options granted was  and per share for the year ended december   and  respectively 
the total stock based compensation cost related to non vested equity awards not yet recognized as an expense as of december  was approximately million 
during october  the compensation committee of our board of directors approved amendments to stock options held by certain employees to permit transferability of such options to family members 
as a result of the amendments  options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock no longer qualify as incentive stock options under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
accordingly  we treated the amended stock options as if they were non qualified stock options since inception  which resulted in a deferred tax asset of approximately million 
also  there was no incremental compensation cost associated with each amended stock option resulting from the measurement of the excess of the fair value of the stock option immediately following its amendment over the fair value of the stock option immediately prior to its amendment based on the share price and other pertinent factors at that date 
business combinations we account for business combinations in accordance with the acquisition method 
the acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition 
our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the completion date of an acquisition 
the judgments that we make in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact net income in periods following a business combination 
we generally use either the income  cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives 
the income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset  discounted to present value 
the cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost 
the market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets 
although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired  the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information 
for acquisitions completed after january   we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date 
each reporting period thereafter  we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to net change in contingent consideration obligation within the consolidated statement of income 
changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation can result from updates in the achievement of financial targets and changes to the weighted probability of achieving those future financial targets 

table of contents significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period 
accordingly  any change in the assumptions described above could have a material impact on the amount of the net change in contingent consideration obligation that we record in any given period 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired  including other definite lived intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized  but reviewed annually for impairment or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we performed our annual impairment test noting no impairment  and we do not believe we are at risk for impairment 
the change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended december  is as follows balance at december  acquired goodwill reclassifications  adjustments and other balance at december  the reclassifications  adjustment and other of million is primarily related to adjustments to our deferred taxes as a result of changes in the apportionment used related to our state effective tax rate

selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues increased to for  as compared to for 
table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million in  compared to  primarily related to the amortization of our newly acquired intangible assets of fusionone and the continued expansion of our platforms 
this increase was offset by the completion of the depreciation of certain assets which  for accounting purposes  have reached the end of their respective useful lives 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net revenues increased to for  as compared to for net change in contingent consideration obligation 
the fair value change in the contingent consideration liability related to the equity holders earn out resulted in additional expense of million for the year ended december  changes in the contingent consideration obligation are driven by the fair value estimates related to our acquisitions of fusionone and sks 
the change in the estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation related to the fusionone earn out is primarily due to the changes in our stock price prior to the amendment and settlement of the fusionone earn out 
the change in the estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation related to the sks earn out is due to changes to the weighted probability of achieving product milestones and operational efficiencies for the sks earn out 
income from operations 
income from operations increased million to million in  compared to this increase was due primarily to increased revenues that resulted from increased transaction volumes and expansion into new programs with our largest customers 
income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased to for  as compared to for interest and other income 
interest and other income increased thousand to million in  compared to interest and other income increased primarily due to increased interest income from increased cash balances and rates on our investments and increased gains on foreign currency transactions 
interest and other expense 
interest expense increased thousand to million in  compared to interest and other expense increased primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations losses on increased foreign denominated monetary assets 
income tax 
during and  we recognized approximately million and million in income tax expense  respectively 
our effective tax rate was approximately and during and  respectively 
in  our effective tax rate was lower than our us federal statutory rate primarily due to the favorable tax impact of the utilization of our federal nol s resulting from the additional consideration paid to the fusionone equity holders during  the favorable impact of r d tax credits  and the impact of income in foreign jurisdictions  which have lower tax rates than the us offset by the unfavorable tax impact of the fair market value adjustment for the contingent consideration obligations related to the earn outs 
we expect to be exposed to fluctuations in our effective rate during the earn out period for our contingent consideration liabilities 
due to the nature of these transactions we may experience significant adjustments to fair value of the contingent consideration obligation depending on the outcome of the target achievements

these amendments  effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  early adoption is prohibited  result in common definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure requirements between us gaap and ifrs 
consequently  the amendments change some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements 
the implementation of this amended accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued amendments to disclosure requirements for presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance  effective retrospectively for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  early adoption is permitted  requires presentation of total comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the implementation of this amended accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures  therefore  we have elected not to early adopt

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we deposit our excess cash in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds and certificates of deposit and  we may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations on our marketable securities  however  such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of these investments 
we do not expect the current rate of inflation to have a material impact on our business 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short and long term investments in a variety of securities  which could include commercial paper  money market funds and corporate debt securities 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  and were invested in liquid money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling  euro  and indian rupee 
the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using period end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses 
we do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities 
although our reporting currency is the us dollar  we may conduct business and incur costs in the local currencies of other countries in which we may operate  make sales and buy materials 
as a result  we are subject to currency translation risk 
further  changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our future net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange losses 
we cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase and hedging activities may be considered if appropriate
