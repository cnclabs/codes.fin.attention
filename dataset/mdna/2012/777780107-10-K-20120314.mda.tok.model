our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of technology based language learning solutions 
we develop  market  and sell language learning solutions consisting of software  online services and audio practice tools primarily under our rosetta stone brand 
our teaching method  which we call dynamic immersion  is designed to leverage the innate  natural language learning ability that children use to learn their native language 
our courses are based on our proprietary interactive technologies and pedagogical content and utilize a sophisticated sequencing of images  text and sounds to teach a new language without translation or grammar explanation 
we believe our award winning solutions provide an effective  convenient and fun way to learn languages 
we currently offer our self study language learning solutions in over languages 
our customers include individuals  educational institutions  armed forces  government agencies and corporations 
the strength and breadth of our solutions have allowed us to develop a business model that we believe distinguishes us from other language learning companies 
our scalable technology platform and our proprietary content can be deployed across many languages  which have enabled us to cost effectively develop a broad product portfolio 
we have a multi channel marketing and distribution strategy that directly targets customers  utilizing print  online  television and radio advertising  public relations initiatives and our branded kiosks 
approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  was generated through our direct sales channels  which include our call centers  websites  institutional sales force and kiosks 
we also distribute our solutions through select retailers such as amazon 
com  barnes noble  best buy  books a million  staples and costco 
we generate revenue primarily from sales of packaged software and audio practice products and online software subscriptions 
our continued growth depends  in part  on our ability to maintain strong brand recognition in order to generate sales from new customers 
we continuously balance our need to achieve short term financial goals with the equally critical need to invest in our products  our brand and our infrastructure to ensure our future success 
in making decisions about spending levels in our various functional organizations  we consider many factors  including our ability to expand our presence and penetration of existing markets  the extent to which we can sell new products and services to existing customers  our success in expanding our brand  
table of contents the evolution of our product and service offerings  and our ability to expand our presence and reach geographically 
we believe the primary factors that affect our financial performance include the following customer acceptance of our product and service offerings  continued product and service innovation  average revenue per customer  direct marketing variables  including print  television and radio media discounts and rates  the relevance of our advertising and website  online pay per click and other online advertising rates  internal and external call center conversion rates  and website traffic and conversion rates  customer brand loyalty  the number and quality of our kiosk locations  our presence in international markets  and cross channel management of consumer and institutional markets 
we believe that our multi channel marketing and distribution models are fundamental to our success 
specifically  we focus on educating customers about the many benefits of our products and services by leveraging our advertising and kiosk network in order to drive website and call center traffic 
on february   our board of directors promoted chief financial officer stephen m 
swad  to president and chief executive officer ceo 
as our ceo assumes his new role  he is conducting an assessment of the company s critical areas over the coming months 
the primary areas of focus will be further stabilizing the us consumer market  regaining positive momentum in asia  taking steps to improve margins across all of our businesses  both in the us and internationally  and examining and evaluating ways to grow our institutional business 
while it will take some time to carry out this assessment  there are some opportunities for short term actions to improve performance that we will be looking to effect  such as eliminating marketing investments that have low expected yields and better leveraging our worldwide g a infrastructure 
as this process evolves  it is possible that we may record one time expenses associated with transition to our new strategy 
components of our statement of operations revenue we derive revenue from sales of language learning solutions consisting of packaged software and audio practice products and online software subscriptions 
revenue is presented as product revenue or 
table of contents subscription and service revenue in our consolidated financial statements 
our audio practice products are normally combined with our packaged software products and sold as a solution 
revenue is primarily derived from the sale of packaged software and audio practice products  online software subscriptions and professional services 
our professional services include training  implementation services and dedicated conversational coaching associated with rosetta stone totale and reflex 
rosetta stone totale online  which was released in july  combines dedicated conversational coaching and an online software subscription 
rosetta stone version totale  which was released in september  combines packaged software and dedicated conversational coaching 
the content of our packaged software and subscription offerings are the same 
we simply offer our customers the ability to choose which format they prefer without differentiating the learning experience 
we began bundling time based subscription licenses of our web based totale services with perpetual licenses of our rosetta stone version language learning solutions in the us consumer market as part of our rosetta stone version totale launch 
as a result  we defer approximately of each of these bundled sales over the term of the subscription license 
we sell our solutions directly to individuals  educational institutions  armed forces  corporations and government agencies 
we distribute our consumer products predominantly through our direct sales channels  primarily our websites and call centers  which we refer to as our direct to consumer channel 
we also distribute our consumer products through our kiosks  which we own  as well as through select retailers 
the majority of our consumer customers purchase our packaged software and audio practice products  online software subscriptions and professional services 
we sell to institutions primarily through our direct institutional sales force 
many institutions elect to license our products on a subscription basis 
for purposes of explaining variances in our revenue  we separately discuss changes in our consumer and institutional sales channels because the customers and revenue drivers of these channels are different 
for the year ended december  and  we reclassified our home school sales vertical from institutional to consumer 
we believe the drivers of acquiring a home school customer are now more aligned with a typical sale in our consumer sales vertical 
prior year information has been modified to conform to current year presentation 
this presentation is also consistent with how we manage the home school channel 
our consumer revenue is affected by seasonal trends associated with the holiday shopping season 
as a result  our fourth quarter ended december  accounted for of our annual revenue in our institutional revenue is seasonally stronger in the second and third quarters of the calendar year due to education and government purchasing cycles 
we expect these trends to continue 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue consists of the direct and indirect materials and labor costs to produce and distribute our products 
such costs include packaging materials  computer headsets  freight  inventory receiving  personnel costs associated with product assembly  third party royalty fees and inventory storage  obsolescence and shrinkage 
cost of subscription and service revenue primarily represents costs associated with supporting our online language learning service  which includes online language conversation coaching  hosting costs and depreciation 
we also include the cost of credit card processing and customer technical support in both cost of product revenue and cost of subscription and service revenue 
we believe cost of revenue will also increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods  as a result of our launch of rosetta stone version totale  which includes services that have higher direct costs to deliver to customers than prior versions of our products 

table of contents operating expenses we classify our operating expenses into three categories sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative 
our operating expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  direct advertising and marketing expenses and professional fees associated with contract product development  legal  accounting and consulting

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our executive  finance  legal  human resources and other administrative personnel  as well as accounting and legal professional services fees and other corporate expenses 
in  there were increases to certain general and administrative expenses to support our expansion into new international markets 
during  we plan on taking steps to reduce certain general and administrative expenses as we realign our cost structure to help fund investment in areas of growth 
stock compensation charge 
included in the respective operating expense lines for is an aggregate million expense  consisting of million in stock based compensation expense and million in payroll tax expense  related to common stock grants awarded to key employees equal to a total of  shares in april this grant was net of the number of shares required to be withheld to satisfy the federal  state and local tax withholding obligations 
the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards was million  which we recognized as stock based compensation expense on the grant date  as the awards were immediately vested 
we allocated this million aggregate expense among the operating expense line items in accordance with the functions performed by the respective employees who received the grants 
no such grant was made in or other income expense other income expense primarily consists of interest income and interest expense 
interest expense is related to our long term debt  the outstanding balance of which was zero as of december  interest income represents interest received on our cash and cash equivalents 

table of contents income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit consists of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
for the year ended december   our worldwide effective tax rate was approximately 
we expect our worldwide rate to be approximately in assuming no general increase in federal  state or foreign income tax rates applicable to companies such as ours 
critical accounting policies and estimates in presenting our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
some of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our future estimates may change if the underlying assumptions change 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting policies listed below involve our more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates and  therefore  could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we believe that a discussion of these policies is necessary to understand and evaluate the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k

revenue is recognized from the sale of packaged software and audio practice products when the product has been delivered  assuming the remaining revenue recognition criteria have been met 
software products include sales to end user customers and resellers 
in most cases  revenue from sales to resellers is not contingent upon resale of the software to the end user and is recorded in the same manner as all other product sales 
revenue from sales of packaged software products are recognized as the products are shipped and title passes and risks of loss have been transferred 
for most of our product sales  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped 
for some sales to resellers and certain other sales  we defer revenue until the customer receives the product because we legally retain a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit 
a limited amount of packaged software products are sold to resellers on a consignment basis 
revenue is recognized for these consignment transactions once the end user sale has occurred  assuming the remaining revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in accordance with accounting standards codification subtopic 
table of contents software revenue recognition customer payments and incentives asc  price protection for changes in the manufacturer suggested retail value granted to resellers for the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered is recorded as a reduction to revenue 
we offer customers the ability to make payments for packaged software purchases in installments over a period of time  which typically ranges between three and five months 
given that these installment payment plans are for periods less than months and a successful collection history has been established  revenue is recognized at the time of sale  assuming the remaining revenue recognition criteria have been met 
packaged software is provided to customers who purchase directly from us with a six month right of return 
we also allow our retailers to return unsold products  subject to some limitations 
in accordance with accounting standards codification subtopic  software revenue recognition products asc  product revenue is reduced for estimated returns  which are based on historical return rates

revenue for set up fees related to online licensing arrangements is recognized ratably over the term of the online licensing arrangement  assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
accounts receivable and deferred revenue are recorded at the time a customer enters into a binding subscription agreement and the subscription services are made available to the customer 
in connection with packaged software product sales and online software subscriptions  technical support is provided to customers  including customers of resellers  at no additional cost for one year from date of purchase 
as the fee for technical support is included in the initial licensing fee  the technical support and services are generally provided within one year  the estimated cost of providing such support is deemed insignificant and no unspecified upgrades enhancements are offered  technical support revenues are recognized together with the software product and license revenue 
costs associated with the technical support are accrued at the time of sale 
revenue for online service subscriptions for dedicated conversational coaching is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period  assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met  which typically range from three months to months 
rosetta stone version totale bundles  which include dedicated conversational coaching online services and packaged software  allow customers to begin their online services at any point during a registration window  which is months from the date of purchase from us or an authorized reseller 
dedicated conversational coaching online service subscriptions that are not activated during this registration window are forfeited and revenue is recognized upon expiry

these arrangements also include contractual periods of post contract support pcs and online hosting services ranging from one to ten years 
revenue for multi element contracts are recognized ratably once the pcs and online hosting periods begin  over the longer of the 
table of contents pcs or online hosting period 
when the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss for a fixed fee arrangement  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded 
revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables as of january   we began to recognize revenue prospectively for new arrangements with multiple deliverables in accordance with asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu no 

for multi element arrangements that include online services and auxiliary items  such as headsets and audio practice products which provide stand alone value to the customer  we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in accordance with asu no 
the new accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
vsoe generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price that we actually charge for that deliverable 
esps reflect our best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis 
we account for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software related products  in accordance with industry specific accounting guidance for software and software related transactions 
for such transactions  revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element  and fair value is generally determined by vsoe or the residual method when vsoe exists only for the undelivered element 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple element arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
we have identified two deliverables generally contained in rosetta stone version totale software arrangements 
the first deliverable is the packaged software  which is delivered at the time of sale  and the second deliverable is the dedicated conversational coaching online services 
we allocate revenue between these two deliverables using the residual method based on the existence of vsoe for the undelivered service element 
amounts allocated to the software are recognized at the time of sale  provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
amounts allocated to the online services are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the online services or upon expiry of the online services 
the language learning software cost of sales are generally recognized at the time of sale 
costs for online services and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance accounting standards codification topic  compensation stock compensation asc  which we adopted effective january  under asc  all stock based awards  including employee stock option grants  are recorded at fair value as of the grant date and recognized as expense in the statement of operations on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
as of december  and  there were approximately million and million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non vested stock option awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of and years  respectively 

table of contents the following table presents the stock based compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock included in the related financial statement line items in thousands years ended december  included in cost of revenue cost of product revenue cost of subscription and service revenue total included in cost of revenue included in operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total included in operating expenses total in accordance with asc topic  the fair value of stock based awards to employees is calculated as of the date of grant 
compensation expense is then recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
we use the black scholes pricing model to value our stock options  which requires the use of estimates  including future stock price volatility  expected term and forfeitures 
stock based compensation expense recognized is based on the estimated portion of the awards that are expected to vest 
estimated forfeiture rates were applied in the expense calculation 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model as follows year ended december  expected stock price volatility expected term of options years years years expected dividend yield risk free interest rate prior to the completion of our initial public offering in april  our stock was not publicly quoted and we had a limited history of stock option activity  so we reviewed a group of comparable industry related companies to estimate our expected volatility over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected term of the awards 
in addition to analyzing data from the peer group  we also considered the contractual option term and vesting period when determining the expected option life and forfeiture rate 
subsequent to the initial public offering  we continue to review a group of comparable industry related companies to estimate volatility  but also review the volatility of our own stock since the initial public offering 
we consider the volatility of the comparable companies to be the best estimate of future volatility 
for the risk free interest rate  we use a us treasury bond rate consistent with the estimated expected term of the option award 

table of contents the following table sets forth a summary of stock option grants since the date of plan inception  through the date of this annual report on form k grant date number of options granted exercise price common stock fair value per share at grant date stock based compensation expense in connection with executive stock grants and ipo option and restricted stock grants we made stock grants  restricted stock grants and stock option grants to our employees on april  in connection with these grants  we recorded an aggregate expense of approximately million in the second quarter of  and an additional million that will be recorded over the four year vesting period of the stock options and restricted stock grants 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified 
intangible assets intangible assets consist of acquired technology  including developed and core technology  customer related assets  trade name and trademark and other intangible assets 
those intangible assets with finite lives are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight line basis over their expected lives in accordance with accounting standards codification topic  goodwill and other intangible assets asc 
on an annual basis  we review our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment based on the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets as compared to the carrying value in accordance with asc in the event the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets  the assets are written down to their fair value 
there has been no impairment of intangible assets during any of the periods presented 
goodwill the value of goodwill is primarily derived from the acquisition of rosetta stone ltd 
formerly known as fairfield sons  ltd 
in january and the acquisition of certain assets of sglc international co 
ltd sglc in november we test goodwill for impairment annually on june of each year at the reporting unit level using a fair value approach  in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc or more frequently  if impairment indicators arise 
such indication occurred during the fourth quarter of when the fair value of the company s publicly traded common stock declined  however  after performing step i of the impairment test under asc as of december   no impairment was identified as the fair value was greater than the carrying value of each reporting unit 
the company will continue to review indicators and it is possible an impairment charge may need to be recorded if trends do not reverse 

table of contents goodwill impairment is tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the second step measures the amount of impairment loss  if any  by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying amount 
in estimating fair value of our reporting units  we compared our market capitalization of our common stock  distributed between the reporting units to the equivalent carrying value total assets less total liabilities of such reporting unit 
these techniques included the income approach ie  the discounted cash flow method and the market approach ie  the guideline public company method 
using our adjusted ebitda projections is a judgment item that can significantly affect the outcome of the analysis  both in basing the allocation on the most relevant time period as well as in allocating fair value between reporting units 
as a result of a limited ability to derive future cash flow estimates from historical experience based on internal business plans  which include consideration of industry trends  competitive actions  technology changes and changes in underlying cost structure  we applied only the guideline public company method in estimating the fair value of our reporting units as of december  based on the fair value calculation  the fair value of the consumer and institutional reporting units exceeded the carrying value by and  respectively 
the factors that we consider important  and which could trigger an impairment review  include  but are not limited to a significant decline in the market value of our common stock for a sustained period  a material adverse change in economic  financial market  industry or sector trends  a material failure to achieve operating results relative to historical levels or projected future levels  and significant changes in operations or business strategy 
valuation of long lived assets in accordance with accounting standards codification topic  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc  we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets 
asc requires recognition of impairment of long lived assets in the event that the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to such assets 
impairment  if any  is recognized in the period of identification to the extent the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the fair value of such asset 
based on our analysis  we believe that no impairment of our long lived assets was indicated as of december  and income taxes for the years ended december   and  we accounted for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards codification topic  income taxes asc  which provides for an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities versus the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
under this method  deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the impact of tax rate changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year that the change is enacted 
asc requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
accordingly  the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are assessed periodically based on the asc more likely than not realization threshold criterion 
in the assessment  
table of contents appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused  and tax planning alternatives 
we believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events 
although it is possible there will be changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates  we believe it is unlikely such changes would have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations 
our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets recognizes that while we have not incurred a cumulative loss over our evaluation period after adjusting for nonrecurring expenses related to our initial public offering in  a substantial loss was incurred in the current year as a result of difficult market conditions 
consideration has also been given to the lengthy period over which these net deferred assets can be realized  and our history of not having tax loss carryforwards in any jurisdiction expire unused 
in  we recognized a tax benefit of million due to the release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of non us subsidiaries which we believe are more likely than not to be realized 
our effective income tax rate in benefited from the availability of previously unrealized deferred tax assets which we utilized to reduce tax expense for united kingdom and japanese income tax purposes 
the release of our valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of asc  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
historical operating income and continuing projected income represented sufficient positive evidence that we used to conclude that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized and accordingly  a release of our valuation allowance was recorded in the fourth quarter of at december  and  our net deferred tax asset was million and million  respectively 
based on our assessment  it appears more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings 
if future results fail to provide objectively verifiable evidence to support the realization of our deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance may be required to reduce the deferred tax assets 
however  currently no valuation allowance has been established for the company s net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance in the future

as a result  we defer approximately of the revenue of each of these bundled sales 
we will recognize the deferred revenue over the term of the subscription license in accordance with accounting standards codification subtopic  software revenue recognition

we are actively working to reduce our business and financial exposures by working with key partners on how we could modify the way we do business together 
we are considering  among other changes  changes to credit limits  payment terms  sku reduction  store reduction or a change from terms to consignment

any change in credit limits or payment terms would have no immediate impact  however a change from terms to consignment could result in recording a charge in the period of the change and the issuance of a credit to the retailer for existing inventory previously purchased on terms 
alternatively  a change from terms to consignment could result in a delay in the recognition of revenue on future shipments until existing inventory has been exhausted and sell through materializes 
also  if the credit quality of a partner deteriorates  we may move to delay the recording of bookings until we receive cash

recent accounting pronouncements accounting standards update no 
comprehensive income topic 
under the amendments to topic  an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
this update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments in this update do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income  thus the adoption of such standard will not have a material impact on our reported results of operations and financial position 
in september  the fasb issued new guidance on goodwill impairment testing asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  effective for calendar years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
the objective of this standard is to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in this standard will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it needs to perform the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test 
only if an entity determines  based on qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value will it be required to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit 
we intend to adopt this new guidance beginning fiscal year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency 
accordingly  our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the volatility of the prices and applicable rates are dependent on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy 
in the event our foreign sales and expenses increase  our operating results may be more greatly affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies with which we do business 
at this time we do not  but we may in the future  invest in derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk 
interest rate sensitivity interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
however  based on the nature and current level of our marketable securities  which are primarily short term investment grade and government securities and our notes payable  we believe that there is no material risk of exposure
