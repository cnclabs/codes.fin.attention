this percentage reduction was attributable to an increase in canadian contract sale prices associated with higher cotton costs on our traditional wound care products without a commensurate increase in the sale prices charged to our exclusive canadian distributor 
the slight increase in distribution fee expense is commensurate with the increase in canadian sales upon which the fee is based  partially offset by an increase in net sales as a percentage of overall canadian sales not subject to the fee by our exclusive canadian distributor 
the decrease in sales incentive expense reflects the discontinuation of a sales incentive program with a major customer in the second quarter of partially offset by higher sales subject to the incentives  coupled with an expansion of the underlying sales incentive programs

no tax benefit was recorded for our united states or united kingdom operations in due to uncertainty surrounding our ability to use available net operating loss carry forwards and net deferred tax assets 
in  we recorded a  income tax provision consisting of a  current foreign tax provision based on our canadian subsidiary s operating results and a  deferred tax provision consisting of a  deferred tax provision related to the amortization of goodwill for tax and not financial reporting purposes  partially offset by a  deferred foreign tax benefit based on our canadian subsidiary s operating results 
due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to use our united states and united kingdom net operating loss carry forwards and net deferred tax assets  a full valuation allowance for the united states and united kingdom net deferred tax assets has been provided 
net loss we generated a net loss of  or per share basic and diluted  in compared to a net loss of  or per share basic and diluted  in liquidity and capital resources cash flow and working capital at december  and december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively 
the  increase in cash and cash equivalents reflects net cash provided by financing activities of  and operating activities of  partially offset by cash used in investing activities of  together with the exchange rate effect of  net cash provided by financing activities of  reflects  in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  less  from the payoff of our line of credit balance and  associated with scheduled capital lease payments 
the net proceeds from issuance of common stock consists of  from the private placement sale of common stock and warrants in june in connection with raising funds principally for the further development of dsc and  from the exercise of warrants and stock options 
net cash provided by operating activities of  stems from  cash provided from operations net loss plus non cash items  together with  cash used from the net change in operating assets and liabilities 
higher receivables  inventory  and prepaid expenses offset by higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities were the main drivers behind the net cash used in connection with the net change in operating assets and liabilities 
the increase in receivables reflects a higher level of current sales and the final payoff of rebates owed in connection with the discontinuation of a significant rebate program 
the increase in inventory reflects a build up to support new products  growth of the international business and improved customer service levels in certain segments of our business 
the increase in prepaid expenses reflects initial advance fee payments on phase clinical trial preparations and timing of other operating expenditure payments 
the increase in accounts payable reflects the growth of the business resulting in higher overall spending levels 
the increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities principally reflects higher accrued bonus  accrued royalties payable due to higher sales of royalty bearing products partially offset by a decrease in the canadian sales rebate 
net cash used in investing activities of  reflects  used for the purchase of investments   for the milestone payment in august due in accordance with the terms of the medihoney license agreement entered into in february and  for capital expenditures 
the majority of the capital expenditures are being made to upgrade and expand our manufacturing capabilities 
working capital increased  at december  to  from  at december  this increase principally reflects the proceeds from our private placement sale of common stock and warrants in june together with funds received from warrant and stock exercises 
management believes that this level of working capital is sufficient to support our existing operations for the next twelve months 
an additional  medihoney milestone payment is due when medihoney sales exceed  on a trailing twelve month basis  which is anticipated in the next twelve months 
financing arrangements in  net cash of  was used to pay off the line of credit 
effective september   we terminated our existing credit agreement with our lender 
in connection with the termination  we recorded a charge of  representing the then unamortized remaining portion of the deferred financing costs of  together with a termination fee of  and related expenses of  as a loss on debt extinguishment 
on march   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the stock of medefficiency for  in cash 
medefficiency is a privately held company that sells a proprietary line of total contact cast products for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers 
in  medefficiency had annual revenues of  and net income of since  we have been a distributor of medefficiency s products 
in  we had  of revenue from the sale of medefficiency products at a gross margin of 
the acquisition of this business is consistent with our strategy to acquire higher margin proprietary advanced wound care products with growth potential that can be leveraged by our global advanced wound care sales and marketing infrastructure 
in making this acquisition  we obtained a product line with an annual sales run rate of approximately  at a gross margin of and significant sales growth potential 
transaction and integration related expenses to be incurred in are expected to be approximately  we anticipate this transaction will be accretive to our results of operations 
we will utilize existing cash on hand to fund the acquisition 
going forward  we are confident that we can replenish these funds based on the strength of our growing advanced wound care business and dsc s continued development progress 
alternatives for funding consist of the sale of company stock  licensing the rights to dsc  asset based lending  monetizing a non strategic company asset  or a combination of all of these 
if market conditions for raising capital are not acceptable to company management  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to support our existing operations for the next twelve months 
prospective assessment our strategic objective is to build the company by both continuing to progress dsc  with an initial indication of the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers  as well as in licensing  developing and launching novel higher margin advanced wound care products while utilizing our cash on hand and cash flow provided by our traditional wound care business to the extent possible to fund this objective 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate external opportunities to leverage our core capabilities for growth  and will consider initiating additional development programs on new indications for dsc to the extent we determine that we cannot finance our growth initiatives internally  additional sources of funding may be available to us through the sale of equity  the sale of licensing rights to dsc and or jointly developing products with third parties 
the launch of a number of new products in recent years bodes well for the future growth of our higher margined advanced wound care products both domestically and abroad 
we continue to work on our pipeline and have identified several product line extensions and new products that are capable of contributing to future sales growth 
traditional wound care sales are expected to remain relatively stable 
our strategy for growth is assuming the existing resources in place are generating the expected return  we will continue to expand our worldwide investment in sales and marketing resources in support of our higher margined advanced wound care products 
in february  we in licensed the worldwide rights to medihoney 
this has served as the catalyst for the expansion of our us  canadian and international businesses 
we plan to add additional sales representatives to the already in place in the us and one additional sales representative in canada and two in the uk during the first half of additional sales representatives will continue to be added thereafter as needed to support the continued growth of the business 
we have established a presence in europe and the middle east through a direct presence in the uk and distribution representatives in a number of the other countries 
we plan to expand our presence in this and other areas of the world employing a direct presence or distributor model as the basis for conducting business  as circumstances dictate 
while the commercial launch of dsc is estimated to be four years away  we believe the market potential of this product for diabetic foot ulcers and other indications that we have the rights to are significant 
in february and may  we reported positive top line results for our dsc phase trial 
we met with the fda to discuss the results of our phase study and the design of our phase study 
the company intends to meet again with the fda to discuss the phase protocols for the pivotal studies and to discuss the cmc portion of the program 
with the funds raised from our private placement sale of common stock and warrants in june  we have started a number of initiatives to prepare for initiation of the phase program 
should everything go according to plan  we will commence the phase study in the second half of the cost of the phase trial and bringing the product to market are presently estimated to be approximately to million 
with available funds on hand and those expected to be generated prospectively from ongoing operations  we do not anticipate the need at this time for additional capital to complete the phase trial for diabetic foot ulcers and to bring the product to market 
we will continue to nurture our traditional wound care business in an effort to sustain it and grow it where possible  utilizing the appropriate amount of human and financial resources to achieve our objectives 
while this area of our business presently represents a significant albeit diminishing percentage of our sales and realizes lower gross profit margins  it generates positive cash flow as it does not require extensive sales and marketing resources to sustain it 
maintenance and growth of this business is important to us as we utilize this cash flow to help support our advanced wound care and pharmaceutical wound care growth initiatives 
with the planned improvement in operations  expected working capital requirements and cash on hand as of december   we anticipate having sufficient liquidity in place to meet our existing operating and product development needs for at least the next twelve months 
further  if needed  we believe the continued success of our advanced wound care business and the development of dsc will serve to improve our ability to raise equity or generate capital from the sale of licensing rights going forward to fund prospective growth initiatives 
additional financial information off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation our management currently believes that inflation has not had  and does not currently have  a material impact on continuing operations 
critical accounting policies estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of sales deductions for trade rebates  sales incentives  discounts and allowances 
significant estimates and assumptions are also required in determining the appropriateness of amortization periods for identifiable intangible assets  the potential impairment of goodwill and the valuation of inventory 
some of these judgments can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates 
for any individual estimate or assumption made by us  there may also be other reasonable estimates or assumptions 
we believe  however  that given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows for the periods presented 
our most critical accounting policies were discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors and are described below 
revenue recognition and adjustments to revenue we sell our products through our own direct sales force and through independent distributors and manufacturers representatives 
the primary end users of our products are nursing homes  hospitals  clinics and home healthcare agencies 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured  which is generally at the time of shipment or receipt by our customers  depending on the terms of the related sales or distribution agreement 
when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  we simultaneously adjust revenue for estimated trade rebates and distribution fees in canada  and estimates of returns and allowances  cash discounts and other sales incentives 
a trade rebate represents the difference between the invoice price to the wholesaler distributor and the end user s contract price 
these rebates are estimated monthly based on historical experience  distributor rebate submission trends  estimated distributor inventory levels  and existing contract sales terms with our distributors and end users 
we have a contract with our exclusive canadian distributor and we pay a fixed fee based on sales subject to the fee as defined for distribution services in canada 
because the services performed by the distributor cannot be separated from the purchase of our products by the distributor  we treat this distribution fee as a reduction of revenue 
the distribution fee is accrued monthly based on net sales to the distributor multiplied by the ratio of recent historical distributor fee expense to net sales 
the percentage of distributor fee expense to net sales is re evaluated quarterly for reasonableness 
sales incentives represent credits granted to specific customers based on attainment of pre determined sales objectives 
sales incentives are accrued monthly in accordance with the terms of the underlying sales incentive agreement and actual customer sales 
sales incentive agreements are generally for a period of one year 
we provide our customers certain limited return rights and we have a formal returned goods policy that guides the disposition of returns with our customers 
we accrue for sales returns and allowances and cash discounts monthly based on current sales and historical activity 
we do not offer our customers price protection rights or concessions 
returns were less than of gross sales in both and we continually monitor the factors that influence rebates and fees  returns and allowances  and other discounts and sales incentives and make adjustments as necessary 
goodwill at december   we had  of goodwill consisting of  relating to the first aid products acquisition in november and  relating to the western medical acquisition in april we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the assessment is performed using the two step process required by accounting guidance relating to goodwill 
the first step is a review for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
for and  the first step of our goodwill impairment test reflected a fair value in excess of the carrying value of our reporting units 
accordingly  we did not perform the second step of this test during these periods 
the cash generating unit level or reporting unit at which we test goodwill for impairment is the operating segment level 
products are allocated to each segment based on the nature and intended use of the product 
all of our goodwill has been allocated to the traditional wound care segment as the business acquisitions which gave rise to the goodwill were traditional wound care businesses 
for and and consistent with prior periods  we estimated the fair value of our segments using the income approach  where we use a discounted cash flow model dcf in preparing our goodwill impairment assessment 
this approach calculates fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after tax cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets 
significant estimates used in the fair value calculation include i estimates of future revenue and expense growth  ii future estimated effective tax rates  iii future estimated capital expenditures  iv future required investments in working capital  v average cost of capital  and vi the terminal value of the reporting unit 
the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our five year forecast 
beyond our five year forecast we assumed a terminal value to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis 
annual revenue growth rates in our dcf model reflect expected growth in our advanced and traditional wound care products 
the weighted average cost of capital used to discount cash flows for the annual goodwill impairment test was 
there have been no substantial changes to the methodology employed  significant assumptions or calculations applied in the first step of the goodwill impairment test over the past several years 
inventory the company writes down the value of inventory by the estimate of the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value 
the estimate takes into account projected sales of the inventory on hand and the age of the inventory in stock 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the provision for the write down of inventory is recorded in cost of sales 
stock based compensation we record compensation expense associated with stock options and other equity based compensation based on the fair value at the grant date and recognized over the requisite service periods 
we estimate the fair value of stock options as of the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model for service and performance based awards 
we use the quoted market price for restricted stock grants 
significant judgment and the use of estimates to value the equity based compensation  particularly surrounding black scholes model assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives are made
