the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item and the risk factors detailed in item a of part i of this report 
business summary overview we are a credit enhancement company with a primary strategic focus on domestic  first lien residential mortgage insurance 
our business segments are mortgage insurance and financial guaranty 
through our financial guaranty segment  we maintain a sizable financial guaranty insured portfolio  consisting of public finance and structured finance risks 
prior to january   we also had a third segment financial services 
mortgage insurance our mortgage insurance segment provides credit related insurance coverage  principally through private mortgage insurance  and risk management services to mortgage lending institutions 
we have provided these products and services mainly through our wholly owned subsidiary  radian guaranty inc  and its wholly owned subsidiaries radian mortgage assurance inc formerly amerin guaranty corporation  and radian insurance inc which we refer to as radian guaranty  radian mortgage assurance  and radian insurance  respectively 
private mortgage insurance protects the holders of our insurance from all or a portion of default related losses on residential mortgage loans made generally to home buyers who make down payments of less than of the home s purchase price 
private mortgage insurance also facilitates the sale of these mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market  most of which are sold to freddie mac and federal national mortgage association fannie mae 
we refer to freddie mac and fannie mae together as government sponsored enterprises or gses 
traditional mortgage insurance 
our mortgage insurance segment offers primary mortgage insurance coverage on residential first lien mortgages first lien 
at december   primary insurance on first liens made up approximately of our total first lien insurance risk in force rif 
prior to  we also wrote pool insurance  which comprised approximately of our total first lien insurance rif at december  non traditional mortgage credit enhancement 
in addition to traditional mortgage insurance  in the past  we provided other forms of credit enhancement on residential mortgage assets 
these products included mortgage insurance on second lien mortgages second lien  credit enhancement on net interest margin securities nims  credit default swaps cdss on domestic and international mortgages and primary mortgage insurance on international mortgages collectively  we refer to the risk associated with these transactions as non traditional 
we stopped writing non traditional business in  other than a small amount of international mortgage insurance  which we discontinued writing in as of december   the aggregate remaining rif on such non traditional mortgage credit enhancement was approximately million  which accounted for less than of our total risk in force 
financial guaranty our financial guaranty segment has provided direct insurance and reinsurance on credit based risks through radian asset assurance inc radian asset assurance  a wholly owned subsidiary of radian guaranty 
financial guaranty insurance typically provides an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty to the holder of a financial obligation of full and timely payment of principal and interest when due 
financial guaranty insurance may be issued at the inception of an insured obligation or may be issued for the benefit of a holder of an obligation in the secondary market 
we have provided financial guaranty credit protection through the issuance of a financial guaranty insurance policy  by insuring the obligations under a cds or through the reinsurance of such obligations 
both a financial guaranty insurance policy and a cds provide the purchaser of such credit protection with a guaranty of the timely payment of interest and scheduled principal when due on a covered financial obligation  and in the case of most of our financial guaranty cdss  credit protection for amounts in excess of specified levels of losses 
these forms of credit enhancement each require similar underwriting and surveillance 
in  in light of difficult market conditions and the downgrade of the financial strength ratings of our financial guaranty insurance subsidiaries  we discontinued writing any new financial guaranty business  other than as necessary to commute  restructure  hedge or otherwise mitigate losses or reduce exposure in our existing portfolio 
since  we have significantly reduced our financial guaranty operations and have reduced our financial guaranty exposures through commutations in order to mitigate uncertainty  maximize the ultimate capital available for our mortgage insurance business and accelerate our access to that capital 
in january  radian asset assurance entered into a three part transaction the assured transaction with subsidiaries of assured guaranty ltd 
collectively assured that included the following the commutation of billion of financial guaranty net par outstanding that was reinsured by radian asset assurance the assured commutation  the ceding of billion of direct public finance business to assured the assured cession  and an agreement to sell to assured municipal and infrastructure assurance corporation the fg insurance shell  a new york domiciled financial guaranty insurance company with licenses to conduct business in states and the district of columbia 
radian asset assurance acquired the fg insurance shell in june in order to pursue potential strategic alternatives in the public finance market 
we expect to complete the sale of the fg insurance shell in the first quarter of  subject to regulatory approval 
this three part transaction with assured reduced our financial guaranty net par outstanding by approximately and is expected to provide a statutory capital benefit to radian asset assurance of approximately million in the first quarter of because radian asset assurance is a wholly owned subsidiary of radian guaranty  this transaction will also provide a statutory capital benefit of million to radian guaranty 
this transaction is consistent with our strategic objectives of accelerating the reduction of our financial guaranty net par outstanding and strengthening the statutory capital positions of radian asset assurance and radian guaranty 
following the assured transaction  on february   radian asset assurance agreed to terminate its arrangement with the national league of cities nlc to explore the formation of a new public finance mutual bond insurance company 
the following table provides the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of for the assured transaction 
while we expect a statutory capital benefit as a result of this transaction as discussed above  under gaap this transaction will result in a reduction in net income  and therefore  a reduction in retained earnings 
statement of operations in millions decrease in premiums written decrease in net premiums earned increase in change in fair value of derivative instruments gain increase in policy acquisition costs gain on sale of affiliate decrease in pre tax income balance sheet in millions decrease in cash deferred policy acquisition costs accounts and notes receivable derivative assets unearned premiums derivative liabilities increase in other assets financial guaranty exposure subject to recapture or termination 
approximately billion of our total net par outstanding as of december   representing of our financial guaranty segment s total net par outstanding was subject to recapture or termination at the option of our primary reinsurance customers and financial guaranty credit derivative counterparties 
in february  three of our cds counterparties exercised their termination rights with respect to corporate collateralized debt obligations cdos that we insured the february cdo terminations 
the february cdo terminations reduced our net par outstanding by billion 
after giving effect to the assured transaction and the february cdo terminations  approximately billion of our total net par outstanding remains subject to recapture or termination at the option of our primary reinsurance customers and financial guaranty credit derivative counterparties 
financial services prior to january   we also had a third segment financial services 
our financial services segment consisted mainly of our ownership interest in credit based asset servicing and securitization llc c bass  which was a credit based consumer asset business 
we wrote off our entire investment in c bass in c bass filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on november   and was subsequently liquidated 
our equity interest in c bass  and a related note receivable from c bass that had also been previously written off  were extinguished pursuant to the plan of liquidation that was confirmed on april  on may   radian guaranty sold to sherman financial group llc sherman  a consumer asset and servicing firm specializing in charged off and bankruptcy plan consumer assets  all of its remaining equity interest in sherman for approximately million in cash  pursuant to a securities purchase agreement the sherman purchase agreement dated as of may   between radian guaranty and sherman 
as a result of the sale  in the second quarter of  we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million  net of transaction related expenses of million  and a pre tax decrease in accumulated comprehensive income of million 
overview of business results as a seller of credit protection  our results are subject to macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the origination environment and credit performance of our underlying insured assets 
the ongoing weakness in the united states us housing and related credit markets  characterized by a decrease in mortgage originations  decline in home prices  mortgage servicing and foreclosure delays  and ongoing deterioration in the credit performance of mortgage and other assets originated prior to  together with current macroeconomic factors such as limited economic growth  the lack of meaningful liquidity in some sectors of the capital markets  and continued high unemployment  have had  and we believe will continue to have  a significant negative impact on the operating environment and results of operations for each of our businesses 
because of these factors  there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding our future performance 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our businesses have been significantly impacted by  and our future success may depend upon  legislative and regulatory developments impacting the housing finance industry 
the gses are the primary beneficiaries of the majority of our mortgage insurance policies  and the federal housing authority fha remains our primary competitor outside of the private mortgage insurance industry 
federal and state efforts to support homeowners and the housing market  including through the us department of the treasury s homeowner affordability and stability plan hasp  have had a positive impact on our business in recent periods 
various regulatory agencies are now in the process of developing new rules under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act that are expected to have a significant impact on the housing finance industry  and the us congress is engaged in planning for the reform of the housing finance market  including the future roles of the gses 
see risk factors because most of the mortgage loans that we insure are sold to freddie mac and fannie mae  changes in their charters or business practices could significantly impact our mortgage insurance business  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material effect on our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty businesses and a decrease in the volume of home mortgage originations could result in fewer opportunities for us to write new insurance business in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
mortgage insurance defaults 
our first lien primary default rate at december   was  compared to at december  our primary default inventory comprised  loans at december   compared to  loans at december   representing an decrease 
our primary default inventory declined slightly in january the reduction in our defaulted inventory has been the result of the total number of defaulted loans that have cured cures  claim payments on defaulted loans  and insurance rescissions and claim denials collectively exceeding the total number of new defaults on insured loans 
despite this positive trend  our overall primary default rates continue to remain elevated compared to historical levels due to continued high unemployment and weakness in the us housing and mortgage credit markets 
in addition  this positive trend slowed in the second half of as the number of new defaults has remained elevated  while cures on existing defaults have been consistently low 
we believe that a return to sustained profitability in our mortgage insurance business is dependent upon both a further reduction in the number of new defaults and an increase in the number of cures  particularly coming from our older delinquent loans 
based on our projections  which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties  we expect continued improvement in the operating results of our mortgage insurance business in and to achieve marginal operating profitability in our mortgage insurance business in for  we are projecting a decrease in new defaults compared to  which compares to an decrease in and a decrease in defaults have remained at elevated levels across all of our mortgage insurance product lines  including our insured portfolio of prime  first lien mortgages 
overall  the underlying trend of high defaults continues to be driven primarily by the poor performance of our through books of business 
in addition  a slowdown in mortgage foreclosures  driven by foreclosure moratoriums  servicing delays and the effect of prolonged modification programs for delinquent loans  has contributed to the sustained high level of our default inventory 
this slowdown has resulted in more defaults remaining unresolved for a longer period of time than has historically been the case 
provision for losses 
our mortgage insurance provision for losses for was  million  and was primarily related to reserves established on new defaults 
our results for were also negatively impacted by increases in our incurred but not recorded ibnr reserve estimate  which includes our estimate for the amount of reserves we will need to reinstate on loans that were previously rescinded and claims that were previously denied 
in addition  our provision for losses has been affected by an increase in the weighted average rate at which defaulted loans are expected to move to claim the default to claim rate  due to a greater than anticipated impact from the aging of underlying defaulted loans 
with continuing declines in home values  persistently high unemployment and delays by servicers in either modifying loans or foreclosing on properties  the time it has taken to cure or otherwise resolve a delinquent loan has been prolonged 
consequently  in recent years  our default inventory has experienced an increase in its weighted average age  and because we apply higher estimated default to claim rates on our older delinquent loans  this has resulted in higher reserves 
although the weighted average age of our defaulted portfolio continued to increase throughout  the pace of this increase slowed in the second half of our assumed aggregate weighted average default to claim rate which incorporates the expected impact of rescissions and denials was approximately and for the years ending december  and  respectively 
for  we anticipate that the aggregate weighted average default to claim rate will be similar to that assumed in our mortgage insurance reserve for losses continues to be favorably affected by our loss management efforts 
our loss reserve estimate incorporates our recent experience with respect to the number of claims that we are denying and the number of insurance certificates that we are rescinding due to fraud  underwriter negligence or other factors  including the impact of our recent experience regarding reinstatements of previously rescinded policies and denied claims 
our current level of rescissions and denials remains elevated compared to historical levels  which we believe reflects the larger concentration of poorly underwritten loans primarily originated during through that are in our default inventory  as well as our extensive efforts to examine all claims for potential rescissions or denials 
we expect the level of rescissions and denials to continue to remain elevated compared to historical levels as long as our through insurance policies comprise the majority of our default inventory 
claims paid 
total mortgage insurance claims paid in were billion and include million related to the termination of certain structured mortgage insurance transactions 
as discussed above  foreclosure backlogs  servicer delays and loan modification programs have reduced the number of defaults going to claim 
claims paid in were also affected by our internal claims payment process 
beginning in  we increased the number of claims that were subject to review for potential violations of our insurance policies 
we currently expect total claims paid for to be approximately billion 
new insurance written 
we wrote billion of new mortgage insurance in  compared to billion of insurance written in the increase in compared to is mainly attributable to an increase in the penetration rate of private mortgage insurance in the overall insured mortgage market  as well as an increase in our share of the private mortgage market 
while the private mortgage insurance industry has made progress in recapturing business from the fha  the fha s market share remains historically high  and is likely to continue to negatively affect the volume of our new insurance written niw 
we have been more aggressively marketing our product offerings that favorably compete with the fha in order to gain market share back from the fha 
in the second quarter of  we implemented a series of changes to our underwriting guidelines and rates  including a more efficient underwriting process for loans conforming to the gse guidelines  lower premium rates for mortgage insurance paid directly by borrowers and an expansion of our non conforming jumbo loan program 
we expect our volume of niw to continue to increase in starting in  we implemented a series of changes to our underwriting guidelines aimed at improving the long term risk profile and profitability of our business 
as a result of these changes  the credit profile of our mortgage insurance portfolio has improved 
our implementation of these stricter guidelines has also contributed to the lower levels of niw compared to historical levels 
since  almost all of our new business production has been prime business 
in addition  fair isaac and company fico scores for the borrowers of these insured mortgages have increased  while the loan to value ltv on these mortgages has decreased  meaning that borrowers generally are making larger down payments in connection with the more recent mortgages that we are insuring 
statutory capital 
under state insurance regulations  radian guaranty is required to maintain minimum surplus levels and  in certain states  a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to the level of risk in force  or risk to capital 
sixteen states the risk based capital or rbc states currently have a statutory or regulatory risk based capital requirement a statutory rbc requirement  the most common of which imposed by of the rbc states is a requirement that a mortgage insurer s risk to capital ratio may not exceed to as a result of ongoing incurred losses  radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio increased to to as of december  after consideration of a recent million contribution from radian group inc radian group  compared to to at december  and to at december  based on our current projections  which are derived from various assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainty and require significant judgment by management  radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio is expected to continue to increase and  absent any further capital contributions from radian group  is expected to exceed to in we actively manage radian guaranty s risk to capital position in various ways  including through reinsurance arrangements  by seeking opportunities to reduce our risk exposure through commutations or other negotiated transactions  by contributing additional capital from radian group to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries  and by monetizing gains in our investment portfolio through open market sales of securities 
after the recent million contribution to radian guaranty  radian group currently has unrestricted cash and liquid investments of million before giving consideration to radian group s tender offer commenced on february  that may be used to further support radian guaranty s risk to capital position 
depending on the extent of our future incurred losses  the amount of capital contributions required for radian guaranty to remain in compliance with the statutory rbc requirements could be substantial and could exceed amounts maintained at radian group 
see risk factors losses in our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty businesses have reduced radian guaranty s statutory surplus and increased radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio  additional losses in these businesses  without a corresponding increase in capital or capital relief would further negatively impact this ratio  which could limit radian guaranty s ability to write new insurance and increase restrictions and requirements placed on radian guaranty and radian group s sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund its obligations in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
financial guaranty net par outstanding 
our financial guaranty segment s net par outstanding was billion as of december   compared to billion at december  the reduction in net par outstanding was primarily due to i counterparties exercising their early termination rights related to structured finance transactions  including seven corporate cdo and four other cdo transactions  ii a commutation of reinsurance exposure to one primary insurer in april  and iii the amortization or scheduled maturity of our insured portfolio and prepayments refundings of public finance transactions 
as a result of the assured transaction and the february cdo terminations  our aggregate financial guaranty net par outstanding has decreased during the first quarter of by an additional billion  which represents of radian asset assurance s net par outstanding as of december  we expect our net par outstanding will continue to decrease as our financial guaranty portfolio matures and as we seek to proactively reduce our financial guaranty net par outstanding 
credit performance 
the overall credit quality of our financial guaranty insured portfolio improved during the percentage of internally rated aaa credits in our portfolio increased to of our net par outstanding at december   from at december  in addition  the percentage of below investment grade big exposure declined to of our total portfolio as of december   from as of december  this was primarily due to credit improvements in our insured portfolios of corporate cdos and cdos of trust preferred securities trups and the removal of million of big exposure from our public finance portfolio as part of the commutation of reinsurance exposure in april as a result of the assured transaction and the february cdo terminations  the percentage of our insured portfolio rated aaa increased from to  the percentage of our insured portfolio rated bbb increased from to  and the percentage of our big exposure increased from to  while the percentage of our portfolio rated aa or a decreased from to 
public finance 
our public finance insured portfolio continues to experience some stress from the general economic downturn and slow economic recovery 
as of december   approximately of our financial guaranty segment s net par outstanding consisted of public finance credits rated big  compared to as of december  substantially all of the public finance credits commuted as part of the assured commutation and ceded as part of the assured cession were rated investment grade bbb or higher  approximately of which were rated aa or a 
consequently  our exposure to public finance risk relative to structured finance risk declined and the overall credit quality of our remaining public finance portfolio declined 
as a result of the assured transaction  the percentage of our public finance portfolio with aaa rating increased from to  and the percentage of our public finance portfolio with lower ratings bbb or lower increased significantly to  while the percentage of our public finance portfolio rated between those levels aa or a decreased significantly to 
in addition  as a result of the assured transaction and the february cdo terminations  the percentage of our total net par outstanding to public finance obligations decreased from to of our total net par outstanding  including a decrease in the percentage of our insured portfolio of general obligation and other tax supported bonds from to of our total net par outstanding 
as of december   we had an aggregate of billion net par exposure to healthcare and long term care credits 
while these sectors were relatively stable in  hospitals have begun to experience a decrease in patient revenues as a result of a significant decline in patient volumes  increased charity care and limited increases in commercial and government reimbursements 
many healthcare institutions are reporting that further expense reduction efforts are unrealistic and that operating losses are expected as healthcare inflation outpaces weak revenue growth 
further  long term care facilities generally have been experiencing gradually declining occupancies  thinner debt service coverage margins and slowly eroding cash positions 
if these trends continue  it could result in further credit deterioration and require increases in our loss reserves related to our healthcare and long term care credits 
although the states and municipalities included within our government related insured credits have generally been able to withstand stresses to date  the lagging impact on municipal governments from the most recent economic downturn is becoming more evident 
we expect the negative trend in this sector to continue into due to the protracted economic downturn and slow economic recovery  the end of federal stimulus revenues and continued stress on tax based revenue receipts in particular where tax revenues are derived from the value of real estate as discussed below 
this negative trend is expected to continue to strain the ability of government entities to maintain balanced budgets and adequate liquidity to meet near term financial obligations 
as a result  we may continue to experience further credit deterioration and municipal defaults in our government related insured credits 
we have seen some credit deterioration in our insured portfolio of other tax supported bond transactions  in particular those that are payable from real estate tax revenues derived from the value of real estate in narrowly defined districts or from special assessments for improvements on certain properties 
declining property values have reduced the assessed value of the tax base in these jurisdictions  resulting in reduced tax revenues being available to pay interest and principal on these insured bonds 
we may experience further credit deterioration in these transactions  which would increase the likelihood of ultimately being required to make claim payments with respect to these bonds  especially those from special districts 
after giving effect to the assured transaction  our net par exposure to this portfolio is approximately billion 
structured finance 
the credit performance of our structured finance portfolio continued to improve during the percentage of internally rated aaa credits in our structured finance portfolio increased to at december   from at december  in addition  the percentage of big exposure declined to of our total structured finance portfolio as of december   compared to as of december   primarily due to an upgrade in the ratings of five cdos 
we have seen stabilization and improved performance across many of the transactions in our directly insured trups cdo portfolio 
banks within these insured transactions continue to show improved performance  while insurance companies in these transactions remain generally stable 
as a result of this trend  we have upgraded of our transactions during  including three transactions from big to investment grade 
our weighted average internal rating for our directly insured trups cdo bonds improved to bb as of december   from b as of december   reflecting the improvement in observed trups cdo performance and our updated internal views of the banking sector and future trups performance 
see results of operations financial guaranty financial guaranty exposure information below for additional information regarding changes in the credit performance of our insured trups cdo portfolio 
our insured cdos of commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs transactions experienced mixed performance in while delinquency levels in the collateral supporting our cdos of cmbs were lower as of december  compared to december   for two of these transactions  loss severities have risen within many of the cmbs backing these cdos 
in  we also have seen interest shortfalls across a small number of the cmbs tranches that back our cdos as a result of reductions in the appraised value of properties that allowed servicers to stop making advances for interest 
although none of these interest shortfalls was large enough in to reach the tranche we insure in any of these transactions  the risk of losses has risen during notwithstanding these developments  our internal ratings for our cmbs transactions two are internally rated aaa  one aa and one bbb remained unchanged during the performance of our million insured cdo of asset backed securities abs also deteriorated further during see financial guaranty exposure information below for additional information regarding this transaction 
results of operations our results for were positively impacted by the change in fair value of derivative and other financial instruments  which occurred primarily due to the widening of radian group s cds spreads 
this widening  in turn  resulted in a corresponding decline in the fair value liability of our insured obligations  primarily non corporate cdos and trups cdos 
because we have the ability to hold our financial guaranty contracts to maturity  changes in market spreads are not necessarily indicative of our ultimate net credit loss payments with respect to these obligations 
our estimated credit loss payments presented in the table below represent our current estimate of the present value net of estimated recoveries that we expect to pay in claims with respect to our insured credit derivatives and net variable interest entity vie liabilities 
the estimated fair value of these obligations is measured as of a specific point in time and may be influenced by changes in interest rates  credit spreads  credit ratings and other market  asset class and transaction specific conditions and factors that may be unrelated to our obligation to pay future claims 
other factors that may cause a difference between the fair value of these obligations and our estimated credit loss payments include the effects of our non performance risk and differing assumptions regarding discount rate and future performance  as well as the expected impact of our loss mitigation activities  including commutations 
in the absence of credit losses  unrealized losses related to changes in fair value will reverse before or at the maturity of these obligations 
however  we may agree to settle some or all of these obligations prior to maturity at amounts that are greater or less than their fair values at the time of settlement  which could result in the realization of additional gains or losses 
the following table summarizes the fair value amounts reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at december   related to these instruments and the present value of our estimated credit loss payments on these instruments 
because the present value of estimated credit loss payments currently exceeds the net fair value liability  we expect to incur additional losses related to these instruments in the future

we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets dta in the fourth quarter of  and as a result  our income tax expense was much less in compared to net premiums written and earned 
net premiums written in increased slightly from  due to an increase in premiums written in the mortgage insurance segment 
for  net premiums earned decreased in both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty segments compared to see results of operations mortgage insurance year ended december  compared to year ended december  net premiums written and earned and results of operations financial guaranty year ended december  compared to year ended december  net premiums earned below for further information 
net investment income 
the decrease in net investment income during  compared to  was primarily due to a decline in our total investment balance due to negative cash flows  as well as a shift from higher yielding securities in our investment portfolio to lower yielding investments 
our allocation to short term and short duration investments remains high in anticipation of near term claim payments in our mortgage insurance segment  and this allocation  combined with certain sales and subsequent reinvestment of longer duration securities in a low interest rate environment  resulted in a lower yield profile for the portfolio 
net gains on investments 
the components of the net gains on investments for the periods indicated are as follows year ended december  in millions net unrealized gains related to change in fair value of trading securities net realized gains on sales net gains on investments during the second quarter of  we sold all of our interests in certain bonds held in our available for sale portfolio that were issued as part of securitizations collateralized by the master settlement agreement msa among certain domestic tobacco manufacturers and states and certain territories the tobacco bonds  realizing a loss on the sale of million 
these losses were more than offset by gains on sales of other securities in our trading portfolio for  as we took advantage of favorable market conditions allowing us to monetize the gains embedded in the investment portfolio through open market sales of securities 
the proceeds from the asset sales were used for liquidity planning purposes or re invested in similar assets 
realized gains from these sales were also additive to the respective statutory capital positions of our subsidiaries that held the investments 
in  a majority of our realized gains on investments occurred as a result of sales from our trading portfolio  in connection with the strategic repositioning of our investment portfolio from tax advantaged securities to securities that provide taxable investment income

the unrealized gains experienced during are primarily due to the significant widening of our cds spread  which widened by  basis points during the year  compared to spread tightening of  basis points in the unrealized losses experienced during were primarily due to the significant tightening of our cds spread

gain on sale of affiliate 
the gain on sale of affiliate for resulted from the sale of our remaining equity interest in sherman on may  provision for losses 
the provision for losses decreased during compared to  primarily due to decreases in both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty provision for losses

other operating expenses 
the decrease in other operating expenses in compared to reflects i a million decrease in stock based compensation expense  ii a million decrease in director s fees that are correlated to changes in our stock price  iii a million decrease in salaries  and iv a million decrease in consulting  legal and audit fees 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in mortgage insurance sales commissions due to increased niw and the increased expenses related to the write off of certain software and technology projects 
in october  we completed an expense initiative aimed at aligning our support services to the current reduced mortgage market 
this re alignment included a workforce reduction of approximately of our corporate and mortgage insurance staff 
interest expense 
these amounts reflect interest on our long term debt 
in november  we issued million of convertible senior notes due november at a significant discount  which increased our interest expense in compared to this significant increase was slightly offset by the repayment of the remaining balance of million on our debentures upon its maturity in june see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

net losses gains on other financial instruments 
the results for were driven by losses on financial guaranty vie debt 
as a result of the adoption in of the accounting standard update regarding improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with vies  we identified and consolidated additional vies with the related fair value gains losses recorded in this line item 
also negatively impacting the results for were losses related to nims vie debt  primarily caused by a tightening in radian group s cds spread during the year  which had the effect of increasing the fair value liabilities of our vies

net investment income 
our mortgage insurance net investment income decreased in compared to  primarily due to our total investment portfolio balance declining in due to negative cash flows  as well as a shift from higher yielding securities in our investment portfolio to lower yielding investments 
our allocation to short term and short duration investments remains high in anticipation of near term claim payments in our mortgage insurance segment  and this allocation  combined with certain sales and subsequent reinvestment of longer duration securities in a low interest rate environment  resulted in a lower yield profile for the portfolio 
all periods include an allocation to the mortgage insurance segment of net investment income from radian group based on allocated capital  which was lower in compared to net gains on investments 
the components of the net gains on investments for the periods indicated are as follows year ended december  in millions net unrealized gains losses related to change in fair value of trading securities net realized gains on sales net gains on investments during the second quarter of  we sold our portfolio of tobacco bonds  as discussed above  and as a result recognized million in realized losses in our mortgage insurance segment in connection with that sale 
these losses were more than offset by gains on sales of other securities in our trading portfolio in the results for were positively impacted by net realized gains on investments in conjunction with the reallocation of our investment portfolio from tax advantaged securities to securities that provide taxable investment income

the components of the gains losses on other financial instruments for the years indicated are as follows year ended december  in millions net gains losses related to nims vie debt gain on the repurchase of long term debt loss related to cps vie other net gains losses on other financial instruments the net gains for reflect the impact of the widening of radian group s cds spread  which widened by  basis points during the year  on the nims bonds still held by us 
the net losses for also were impacted by the movement of radian group s five year cds spread  which tightened by  basis points during our risk in force related to nims has declined from million at december   to million at december  as a result of payments made by us as nims bonds have matured

provision for losses 
the following table details the financial impact of the significant components of our mortgage insurance provision for losses for the periods indicated year ended december  in millions new defaults existing defaults second lien  loss adjustment expense lae and other provision for losses for  and  the financial impact for each component has been recalculated on a year to date basis  such that the sum of the individual quarterly impacts within each respective year will not equal the recalculated impacts 
for example  the impact from a loan that defaults in one quarter that then cures in the next quarter of the same year is not reflected within the year to date provision for losses  as the net impact is zero for the year to date period 
represents the provision for losses attributable to loans that were in default as of the beginning of each period indicated  including a the change in reserves for loans that were in a default status including pending claims as of both the beginning and end of each period indicated  b the net impact to provision for losses from loans that were in default as of the beginning of each period indicated but were either a cure  a prepayment  a paid claim or a rescission or denial during the period indicated and c the impact to our ibnr reserve during the period related to changes in actual and estimated reinstatements of previously rescinded policies and denied claims 
includes the effect of reinsurance recoveries from captive and smart home transactions  second lien activity  lae and other miscellaneous loss related activity 
our mortgage insurance provision for losses for improved relative to this decrease was driven primarily by a decline in new default notices and a relative improvement in the composition of the delinquent loan inventory including changes associated with the aging of delinquent loans and loans moving into pending claim status  which more than offset the decrease in cures 
our aggregate weighted average estimated default to claim rate was approximately at december   compared to at december  and at december  in addition  existing defaults in were negatively affected by increases in our severity assumptions  due mainly to an increase in estimated severity on pool insurance defaults 
our reported rescission and denial activity in any given period is subject to future challenges by our lender customers 
recent trends in insurance rescissions and claim denial activity reflect lenders challenging a greater number of rescissions and denials  and the overall challenges have been more effective ie  producing new or additional information that supports a reinstatement of coverage or a claim payment 
reinstatements of policies and resubmissions of claims that had been rescinded or denied as of the prior year end totaled million in  compared to million in as a result of these trends  we expect that a larger portion of previously rescinded policies will be reinstated and previously denied claims will be resubmitted with the required documentation and ultimately paid  and we have considered this expectation in developing our ibnr reserve estimate 
this estimate  which primarily consists of our estimate of the future reinstatements of previously rescinded policies and denied claims  was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the following table illustrates the impact to our loss reserve estimates due to estimated insurance rescissions and claim denials as of the dates indicated in millions december  december  december  decrease to our loss reserve due to estimated rescissions and denials the following table illustrates the amount of first lien claims submitted to us for payment that were rescinded or denied for the periods indicated year ended december in millions rescissions first loss position denials first loss position total first loss position rescissions second loss position denials second loss position total second loss position total first lien claims submitted for payment that were rescinded or denied related to claims from policies in which we were in a first loss position and would have paid the claim absent the rescission or denial 
related to claims from policies in which we were in a second loss position 
these rescissions or denials may or may not have resulted in a claim payment obligation due to deductibles and other exposure limitations included in our policies 
includes a small amount of submitted claims that were subsequently withdrawn by the insured 
rescission and denial rates in have been affected by an increase in the number of claims received that we are reviewing for potential violations of our insurance policies 
the following table shows the cumulative denial and rescission rates  net of reinstatements  as of december   on our total first lien portfolio for each quarter in which the claims were received for the periods indicated claim received quarter cumulative rescission denial rate for each quarter percentage of claims resolved q q q q q q q q q q rescission denial rates represent the ratio of claims rescinded or denied to claims received by claim count and represent as of december  the cumulative rate for each quarter based on number of claims received during that quarter 
until all of the claims received during the periods shown have been internally resolved  the rescission denial rates for each quarter will be subject to change 
these rates also will remain subject to change based on reinstatements of previously rescinded policies or denied claims 
the percentage of claims resolved for each quarter presented in the table above  represents the number of claims that have been internally resolved as a percentage of the total number of claims received for that specific quarter 
a claim is considered internally resolved when it is either paid or it is concluded that the claim should be denied or rescinded  though such denials or rescissions could be challenged and  potentially reinstated 
for the third and fourth quarters of  a significant portion of claims received for those quarters have not been internally resolved  therefore  we do not believe the cumulative rescission rates for those periods are presently meaningful and are therefore not presented 
change in reserve for premium deficiency 
for and  the provision for second lien premium deficiency was impacted by the transfer of incurred losses to second lien loss reserves and by updates to our underlying assumptions 
this had the effect of reducing our second lien premium deficiency reserve 
see critical accounting policies reserve for premium deficiency below for a description of our reserving process 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses decreased in as compared to  due to a reduction in salaries as well as stock based compensation expenses that are correlated to changes in our stock price

this re alignment included a workforce reduction of approximately of our corporate and mortgage insurance staff 
contract underwriting expenses for  including the impact of reserves for contract underwriting remedies  were million compared to million for  primarily due to an increase in estimated remedy expenses for loans previously written via contract underwriting 
during  loans underwritten via contract underwriting for flow business accounted for of applications  of commitments for insurance and of insurance certificates issued  compared to  and  respectively  for interest expense 
interest expense includes an allocation to the mortgage insurance segment of interest on our long term debt based on allocated capital 
our consolidated interest expense significantly increased during as a result of the issuance of million of convertible notes at a large discount in november this increase more than offset the decrease in the allocation percentage to the mortgage insurance segment in  which is based on relative equity for this segment calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap

excluding the impact of the termination of captive reinsurance arrangements  net premiums written decreased in compared to  primarily as a result of the smaller mortgage market  increased competition from the fha and more restrictive underwriting guidelines 
net premiums earned increased slightly in  mainly due to a reduction in the accrual for premium refunds related to insurance rescissions and a decrease in ceded premiums  partially offset by a decrease in premiums earned from second liens and international business as this business runs off 
net premiums earned in and were reduced by million and million  respectively  due to a significant increase in estimated premium refunds associated with our expectation of increased rescissions 
net investment income 
the decrease in net investment income during  compared to  was due to lower yields in our investment portfolio  as a result of a continued reallocation of our investment portfolio to shorter term investments in anticipation of future claim payments

net gains losses on other financial instruments 
the gains losses on other financial instruments for both and were negatively impacted by losses related to nims vie debt  primarily caused by a tightening in radian group s cds spread  which had the effect of reducing the impact of our non performance risk adjustment included within the fair value estimate of our nims vie debt 
additionally  radian group purchased cps securities  which resulted in an allocation of losses associated with these investments and related vie debt 
net impairment losses recognized in earnings 
net impairment losses for  compared to  included a lesser amount of impairments on fixed maturity investments available for sale and equity securities available for sale 
other income 
the decrease in other income for as compared to is due to a decline in contract underwriting income resulting from the overall decline in mortgage origination volume

our mortgage insurance provision for losses for increased compared to  primarily as a result of a decrease in the impact of changes in our estimated insurance rescissions and claim denials in compared to during  we significantly increased our estimate for rescissions and denials  which resulted in a lower default to claim rate used in determining our loss reserve estimate as of december   and benefited our loss reserve estimate by approximately billion in during  the impact to our loss reserve from estimated rescissions and denials declined  primarily due to the realization of actual rescissions and denials 
change in reserve for premium deficiency 
for  the reserve for second lien premium deficiency was impacted by the transfer of premium deficiency reserves to loss reserves and by updates to assumptions underlying our loss estimates 
in  we recorded a decrease in the reserve for second lien premium deficiency due to the transfer of premium deficiency reserves to loss reserves and changes in estimates due to the settlement of certain second lien transactions at less than our estimates of reserves 
policy acquisition costs 
the increase in policy acquisition costs for compared to was mainly due to an increase in our estimated loss rate assumptions  which resulted in an acceleration of amortization 
other operating expenses

we provide additional information below regarding the performance of certain financial guaranty transactions for which claim payments including amounts previously paid are expected to exceed million 
we have provided credit protection on the senior most tranche of a cdo of abs transaction the cdo of abs with million net par outstanding at december  the underlying collateral consists predominantly of mezzanine tranches of mortgage backed securities mbs 
as of december   million or of the underlying collateral was rated big by at least one rating agency  of which million or of the underlying collateral had defaulted 
as of december   this transaction was rated d by standard poor s rating service s p and ca by moody s investor service moody s 
our own internal rating for this transaction is d 
due to the structure of the cdo of abs  we do not expect to pay claims related to shortfalls in principal payments for this transaction until sometime between and the legal final maturity date for the transaction in although losses for this transaction are difficult to estimate  we continue to believe that absent a commutation of our exposure or other successful loss mitigation  our ultimate claim payments with respect to principal payments for this transaction will be an amount that is substantially all of our net par outstanding for this transaction 
in november  the cdo of abs experienced an approximately thousand interest shortfall  which was subsequently repaid in december we expect the transaction will again begin to experience interest shortfalls in as a result of the november interest shortfall  we established a reserve for this transaction in the fourth quarter of for statutory accounting purposes 
because radian asset assurance is a direct subsidiary of radian guaranty  this statutory reserve had a direct  negative impact on the statutory capital position and risk to capital ratio of radian guaranty as well 
we continue to explore loss mitigation alternatives with respect to this transaction  including the possibility of commuting our remaining risk 
we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in such loss mitigation efforts 
see risk factors our financial guaranty portfolio has experienced deterioration as a result of general erosion in credit markets and the overall economy and is susceptible to further deterioration which could have a material adverse effect on the capital adequacy of radian guaranty 
under gaap  this cdo of abs constitutes a vie 
therefore  we consolidate the assets and liabilities of this vie and have elected to record them at fair value 
as such  our fair value liability associated with this transaction is included in vie debt on our consolidated balance sheets 
because the interest shortfall discussed above has not significantly altered our cash flow projections for this transaction  we do not expect that the interest shortfall will have a significant impact on our gaap related fair value liability for the cdo of abs 
we have reinsured several primary financial guaranty insurers obligations with respect to million in net par outstanding at december   related to jefferson county  alabama the county sewer warrants the obligations 
the county s sewer system operations have generated sufficient revenues since the beginning of to pay interest on its outstanding debt  as well as regularly scheduled annual installments of principal in february of  and  primarily due to historically low prevailing interest rates on the county s variable rate obligations 
we believe a number of factors continue to adversely affect the performance of our insured obligations  including the county s highly leveraged capital position  the sub par performance of the sewer facilities  the possibility that the county will be unable to generate sufficient revenues to make regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest on the obligations if interest rates increase  and the filing by the county on november   of a petition for bankruptcy the bankruptcy petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code the bankruptcy code with the us bankruptcy court in the northern district of alabama the bankruptcy court 
the county s financial condition is suffering from a liquidity crisis occasioned  in part  by court decisions invalidating an occupational tax  which contributed approximately million or one third of the county s operating revenues to finance the county s operations unrelated to the sewer system operations 
the county has been unable to replace these tax revenues to date  placing an additional strain on the county s finances 
currently  the county cannot raise taxes or fees without state approval and the majority of its tax revenues are for specific purposes 
on september   the county voted to accept an agreement in principle that  if implemented  would have resulted in the refinancing of the county s sewer obligations by july  and the settlement of outstanding claims and litigation with respect to the obligations 
the county and the state court appointed receiver for the sewer system the receiver had been in negotiations to reach a definitive agreement 
negotiations abruptly ended on november   when the county filed the bankruptcy petition 
the receiver promptly filed a motion in the bankruptcy court to have his receivership order and its continuing effectiveness accepted by the bankruptcy court 
creditors also sought to have the bankruptcy petition dismissed as ineligible 
on january   the bankruptcy court ruled the january th order that the sewer system is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and that the receiver was without power to exercise authority over the system 
in practical terms  the county was restored to operational control of the system subject to the bankruptcy court s jurisdiction 
we believe the removal of the receiver will make the ultimate structuring of a plan for the county emergence from bankruptcy more difficult 
the bankruptcy court ruled that the system s net revenues are exempt from the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code and may be paid to creditors  but may be paid only after the payment of operating expenses of the system 
in addition  it has been reported that the relevant parties have agreed upon a monthly distribution amount of the net revenues to be paid to creditors  which reduces the risk of a deficiency in the payment of interest on the obligations in the near future 
the bankruptcy court did not rule on the issue of whether the county was eligible to file the bankruptcy petition  and the bankruptcy court s ruling on this issue is still pending 
while the full potential impact of the bankruptcy is uncertain at this time  the trustee for the obligations has the ability  with bankruptcy court approval  to accelerate the payment of these obligations 
this would likely result in more frequent direct claims of up to million of our reinsurance net par exposure related to regularly scheduled payments of debt service under reserve fund surety policies issued by our primary insurers 
to date  the trustee has not sought to accelerate these payments 
similarly  the withholding of net revenues by the county for payment of operating expenses as defined by the county  could result in further draws on those sureties for payments of regularly scheduled debt service and the reduction of current salvage amounts receivable by us against claims that we had paid in we began paying claims related to the obligations in  and have paid million of claims  net of salvage  on this transaction through december  in addition  as of december   we had a million net claim liability for all of our exposure on this transaction 
in addition  we are closely monitoring our exposure to our insured portfolio of directly insured senior bonds trups bonds issued pursuant to trups cdos 
we provide credit protection on these trups bonds through separate cds contracts  meaning that with respect to four of the trups bonds we insure  we entered into two separate cds contracts each with a different counterparty covering the same trups bond 
our total aggregate net par outstanding related to trups bonds was  million as of december   which is a decrease from december  many issuers of the trups collateral underlying our insured obligations have been negatively affected by the most recent us economic recession and slow recovery  and as a result  have defaulted on their obligation to pay interest on their trups or have voluntarily chosen to defer interest payments  which is permissible for up to five years 
recently  however  the number of cures of previous defaults and the payment of deferred interest payments on the trups collateral has outpaced new initial defaults and deferrals 
as of december   billion of our net par outstanding related to trups bonds was internally rated big 
the fair value liability of our trups bonds  which are accounted for as derivatives  was million as of december  one of our insured trups bonds  with million of net par outstanding as of december   experienced interest shortfalls from october through april  for which we paid an aggregate of million in interest shortfall claims 
in july  as a result of excess cash flows that became available from collateral prepayments  these interest shortfalls were repaid to us and this bond is no longer in default 
while we currently do not expect to pay additional interest or principal shortfall claims on this trups bond  if additional shortfalls were to occur  we may be required to pay a liquidity claim as discussed in liquidity and capital resources financial guaranty below on this cds contract 
it should be noted that even relatively small changes in trups default rates or economic conditions from current projections could have a material impact on the timing and amount of cash available to make principal and interest payments on the underlying trups bonds 
therefore  the occurrence  timing and duration of any event of default and the amount of any ultimate principal or interest shortfall payments are uncertain and difficult to predict 
we continue to explore loss mitigation alternatives with respect to our trups bond portfolio  including the possibility of commuting our remaining risk 
we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in such loss mitigation efforts 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income loss 
the net loss in compared to net income in was primarily due to the significant unrealized losses on financial instruments  including derivatives  in these unrealized losses resulted primarily from the tightening of our cds spread 
the results were also negatively impacted by the recording of a valuation allowance against our dta 
net premiums earned 
net premiums earned for were lower than  primarily due to a large commutation in june  which reduced our net par outstanding by billion and reduced our premiums earned by million  and also due to the maturity and termination of policies written in previous years without any corresponding new policies 
in addition  refundings  earned premiums resulting from moving financial guaranty policies to case reserve from intensified surveillance and adjustments to installment policies were lower in compared to net investment income 
the decrease in net investment income during  compared to  was due to lower yields in our investment portfolio as a result of a continued reallocation of our investment portfolio to shorter term investments 
in addition  assets were also reallocated from longer duration  higher yielding tax exempt municipal securities to taxable securities of intermediate duration with lower interest rates 
net gains on investments 
the realized gains on investments in and reflected improved market conditions and activity related to the reallocation of our investment portfolio to investments with shorter duration 
change in fair value of derivative instruments 
the large unrealized fair value loss for was primarily due to the significant tightening of our cds spread 
we also experienced multi notch downgrades from the rating agencies in one project finance transaction and one cdo of middle market clo transaction  which resulted in significant widening of the underlying credit risk spread and increased our unrealized losses for these transactions 
slightly offsetting these losses were improvements in the underlying credit spreads of our insured corporate cdos  cmbs  rmbs  and trups 
net gains losses on other financial instruments 
the results for reflect the adoption of the accounting standard update regarding improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with vies 
as a result of this update  we identified and consolidated additional vies and recorded the related fair value gains losses in this line item 
the losses related to changes in fair value of our vie debt for were mainly due to the significant tightening of our cds spread 
provision for losses 
the provision for losses for decreased compared to due to favorable loss developments in our public finance business  which were partially offset by an increase in the provision for losses in our structured finance business 
the provision for losses was reduced by million as a result of adjustments made to our estimate of losses based on the june commutation of billion in assumed net par outstanding and certain favorable developments in our structured finance direct line of business 
policy acquisition costs 
the decrease in policy acquisition costs for compared to was primarily due to the decrease in net premiums earned in and the commutation of billion of net par outstanding in june  which resulted in our accelerating million of policy acquisition costs and reduced the base asset to be amortized 
other operating expenses 
the decrease in other operating expenses for compared to was primarily due to decreases in salaries  severance  audit fees and consulting fees  which were partially offset by an increase in expenses related to consolidated vies 
interest expense 
interest expense for and included interest on our long term debt  which was allocated to the financial guaranty segment based on allocated capital 
income tax provision 
the financial guaranty segment had an income tax provision of million for compared to an income tax provision of million for the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate of for was mainly related to the recording of a valuation allowance against our dta  the tax benefit relating to our tax exempt interest income  and the tax provision relating to our foreign subsidiary operations 
results of operations financial services as stated above in business summary  as of january   we did not have a financial services segment 
the following table shows a summary of the results of operations for our financial services segment prior to january  year ended december  in millions equity in net income of affiliates sherman gain on sale of affiliate sherman net income see business summary above for more information regarding this prior segment 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  including payments under operating lease agreements  are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as liabilities but represent a contractual commitment to pay 
the following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations and commitments  including our expected claim payments on insurance policies  as of december   and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the narrative following the table and in the notes to consolidated financial statements that are referenced in the table 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years uncertain long term debt obligations principal and interest note capital lease obligations operating lease obligations note nims derivative instruments and vies purchase obligations reserve for losses and lae note unrecognized tax benefits note total amounts represent management s estimate of credit loss payments related to these instruments as described in results of operations above 
our reserve for losses and lae reflects the application of accounting policies described below in critical accounting policies reserve for losses 
the payments due by period are based on management s estimates and assume that all of the loss reserves included in the table will result in claim payments  net of expected recoveries 
included in the uncertain category is million of unearned premium reserves  which are included in our reserve for losses and lae 
negative amounts presented are primarily related to expected recoveries on our financial guaranty claims 
the timing of these potential payments is uncertain given the nature of the obligation 
as of december   million of our total million of gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits associated with the provisions of the accounting standard regarding accounting for income taxes is expected to be paid in less than a year 
we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement for the remaining million of liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with certain of our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other contractual obligations and commitments in addition to the contractual obligations set forth in the table above  we have the following contractual obligations and commitments 
investment commitments 
as part of the non investment grade component of our investment portfolio  we had unfunded commitments of million at december   related to alternative investments that are primarily private equity structures 
these commitments have capital calls expected through  with the possibility of additional calls through  and certain fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
gse approvals 
in february  the gses each approved radian mortgage assurance to write new mortgage insurance in certain rbc states  subject to certain terms and conditions 
pursuant to the gse approvals  radian group will be required to make a million capital contribution to radian guaranty upon radian guaranty s breach of a statutory rbc requirement such that the use of radian mortgage assurance is required to continue to write new business in the applicable rbc state 
in addition  the gse approvals are conditioned upon our compliance with a broad range of conditions and restrictions

affiliate guaranty indemnification agreements 
we and certain of our subsidiaries have entered into the following intercompany guarantees radian guaranty and radian mortgage assurance are parties to a cross guaranty agreement 
this agreement provides that if either party fails to make a payment to a policyholder  then the other party will step in and make the payment 
the obligations of both parties are unconditional and irrevocable  however  no payments may be made without prior approval by the insurance regulatory authority of the payor s state of domicile 
radian mortgage assurance had no risk in force exposure as of december  radian guaranty has agreed to maintain radian insurance s tangible net worth at a minimum of million and to cause radian insurance to at all times have sufficient liquidity to meet its current obligations  pursuant to a net worth and liquidity maintenance agreement between the two companies 
radian group has agreed to guarantee  up to a maximum amount of million  radian guaranty s obligations to radian insurance under the net worth and liquidity maintenance agreement discussed immediately above  in the event that radian guaranty is not able to or permitted by the pennsylvania insurance department to perform under the agreement 
radian group and radian mortgage insurance inc radian mortgage insurance  a subsidiary of radian guaranty  are parties to a guaranty agreement in which radian group has agreed for the benefit of radian mortgage insurance s creditors to make funds available on demand for the full and complete payment of all due but unpaid liabilities 
prior to our acquisition of enhance financial services group inc efsg in  efsg issued a guaranty of payment of the liabilities and obligations of its subsidiary  radian reinsurance bermuda limited  deriving from any insurance or reinsurance contract the enhance guaranty  for the purpose of maintaining certain regulatory solvency and liquidity margin requirements of the bermuda monetary authority 
following our acquisition of efsg  radian group issued a guaranty for the benefit of efsg to make funds available to efsg for its performance of the enhance guaranty  to the extent that efsg is unable to satisfy those obligations 
as of january  this subsidiary no longer had any insurance liabilities  and in february  was placed into liquidation 
radian group and radian mortgage assurance are parties to a guaranty agreement 
this agreement provides that radian group will make sufficient funds available to radian mortgage assurance to ensure that radian mortgage assurance has a minimum of million of statutory surplus every calendar quarter 
to allow our mortgage insurance customers to comply with applicable securities regulations for issuers of abs including mbs  we have been required  depending on the amount of credit enhancement we were providing  to provide audited financial statements for the insurance subsidiary participating in these transactions or a full and unconditional holding company level guarantee for our insurance subsidiaries obligations in such transactions 
radian group has guaranteed two structured transactions for radian guaranty with approximately million of remaining credit exposure 
radian group s us consolidated federal income tax returns  which include commonwealth mortgage assurance company of texas s cmac of texas federal tax returns  were under examination by the internal revenue service irs for tax years through we are currently contesting proposed adjustments resulting from the irs examination of these tax years 
effective december  radian group and cmac of texas entered into an assumption and indemnification agreement with regard to these proposed adjustments 
through this agreement  radian group agreed to indemnify cmac of texas for any tax payments ultimately due to the irs for the proposed adjustments  which relate to the recognition of certain tax losses and deductions that were generated through our investment in a portfolio of residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits remics currently held by cmac of texas 
this indemnification was in lieu of an immediate capital contribution that otherwise would have been needed from radian group to cmac of texas  based on an estimate for this potential liability  in order for cmac of texas to maintain its minimum statutory surplus requirements 
there remains significant uncertainty with regard to the amount and timing of any resolution with the irs  and we are currently contesting the proposed adjustments related to the remics 
in addition to the foregoing  we use reinsurance from affiliated companies to allow radian guaranty to remain in compliance with insurance regulations that limit the amount of risk that a mortgage insurance company may retain on a single loan to of the indebtedness of the insured 
further  in and  radian guaranty  in order to support its capital position  entered into excess of loss reinsurance agreements with radian insurance 
under these agreements  radian guaranty transferred a total of approximately billion of risk in force to radian insurance 
these pools of loans generally consist of a higher concentration of fixed rate  prime  high fico loans than our overall mortgage insurance portfolio 
as of december   the remaining risk in force under these agreements was billion 
off balance sheet arrangements all vies must be evaluated for consolidation in accordance with the accounting standard regarding consolidation of vies 
vies are entities as defined by the accounting standard and include corporations  trusts or partnerships in which equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
our interests in vies may be accounted for as insurance contracts or financial guaranty derivatives or in some cases  as described more fully below  we have consolidated the vies 
for insurance contracts with vies that we do not consolidate  we record reserves for losses and lae  and for derivative interests in vies that we do not consolidate  we record changes in the fair value as a corresponding derivative asset or derivative liability 
our primary involvement with vies relates to transactions in which we provide a financial guaranty to one or more classes of beneficial interest holders in the vie 
vies may also be used to create securities with a unique risk profile desired by investors and as a means of transferring risk  such as our smart home transactions 
we do not record the underlying assets or liabilities of the vies on our balance sheets unless we are the primary beneficiary of the vie 
smart home in  we developed a program referred to as smart home  for reinsuring risk associated with non prime mortgages and riskier products 
these reinsurance transactions  through the use of vie structures  effectively transfer risk from our portfolio to investors in the capital markets 
since august  we have completed four smart home reinsurance transactions 
we exercised our option to terminate two of these transactions in march  with rif of approximately million 
the two remaining transactions will mature within the next months one in november and one in june  and the ultimate recoverable amounts from these transactions will be dependent upon the amount and timing of paid losses in these transactions through their respective maturity dates 
details of the two remaining transactions aggregated as of the initial closing of each transaction and as of december   are as follows initial as of december  pool of mortgages par value billion billion risk in force par value billion billion notes sold to investors risk ceded principal amount million million each transaction began with the formation of an unaffiliated  offshore reinsurance company 
we then entered into an agreement with the smart home reinsurer to cede to the reinsurer a portion of the risk and premium associated with a portfolio of loans 
each class of notes relates to the loss coverage levels on the reinsured portfolio and is assigned a rating by one or more of the three major rating agencies 
we do not hold any of the credit linked notes issued as part of this structure  therefore  we have no significant variable interests in the structures  and are not subject to consolidation under this standard 
financial guaranty vies as a provider of credit enhancement  we have entered into insurance contracts with vies and derivative contracts with counterparties in which we have provided credit protection directly on variable interests by vies or  in some cases  obtained the contractual rights of our counterparties with respect to the vies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
put options on cps in september  radian asset assurance entered into a contingent capital transaction pursuant to which three custodial trusts issued an aggregate of million in cps million by each custodial trust to various holders 
based on our additional involvement in these trusts  we concluded that we are the party that directs the activities that most significantly influence the economic performance of these vies and has the right to receive benefits that would be significant to these vies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
liquidity and capital resources radian group short term liquidity needs radian group serves as the holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own 
radian group s principal liquidity demands for the next months include funds for i the payment of certain corporate expenses  ii interest payments on our outstanding long term debt  iii repayments of our senior notes due february  iv capital support for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries  v potential payments to the irs resulting from the examination by the irs for the through tax years  and vi the payment of dividends on our common stock 
radian group had immediately available  directly or through an unregulated direct subsidiary  unrestricted cash and liquid investments of million at december  this amount includes million of investments contained in our cps custodial trusts as discussed below 
in november and february  radian group contributed approximately million and million  respectively  to its mortgage insurance subsidiaries to support their capital positions  as further discussed below 
both of these contributions were effective as of december   and therefore  the million of unrestricted cash and liquid investments reflects amounts remaining after giving effect to these contributions 
we expect to fund radian group s short term liquidity needs with i existing cash and marketable securities  including  if necessary  million held in the cps trust accounts  and ii cash received under the expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries 
if radian group s current sources of liquidity are insufficient for radian group to fund its obligations  radian group may be required to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt  by issuing additional equity  or by selling assets  which we may not be able to do on favorable terms  if at all 
at december   we did not have the intent to sell any debt securities classified as held to maturity or available for sale and in an unrealized loss position  and determined that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the securities before recovery or maturity 
corporate expenses and interest expense 
radian group has expense sharing arrangements in place with its principal operating subsidiaries that require those subsidiaries to pay their share of holding company level expenses  including coupon rate interest payments on our outstanding long term debt 
payments of such corporate expenses for the next months  excluding interest payments  are expected to be approximately million 
for the same period  payments of interest on our long term debt are expected to be approximately million 
these amounts are expected to be fully reimbursed by our subsidiaries under our existing expense sharing arrangements 
these expense sharing arrangements  as amended  have been approved by applicable state insurance departments  but such approval may be modified or revoked at any time 
in addition  pursuant to the gses approval of radian mortgage assurance as an eligible mortgage insurer  gse consent is required to modify or amend the expense sharing agreements 
approximately million of future expected corporate expenses and interest expense approximately million for the next months has been accrued for and paid by certain subsidiaries to radian group as of december   and therefore  the total unrestricted cash and liquid investments held by radian group as of december   includes these amounts 
a portion of these expenses approximately million relates to performance based compensation expenses that could be reversed in whole or in part  depending on changes in our stock price and other factors 
to the extent these expenses are reversed  radian group would be required to reimburse the subsidiaries that paid these expenses to radian group 
in addition  under the fannie mae approval for radian mortgage assurance  radian group is required to contribute to radian guaranty the amount of any future interest expense payments made by radian guaranty or radian mortgage assurance to radian group pursuant to the terms of the interest expense sharing arrangements among these entities 
pursuant to the terms of our expense sharing arrangements  any interest expense payments from radian guaranty or radian mortgage assurance to radian group in are expected to be immaterial 
repayment of senior notes 
our senior notes with million in principal amount are due in february on february   radian group commenced a modified dutch auction tender offer the tender offer to purchase a portion of its outstanding senior notes due the notes for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed million which may be increased at our discretion subject to increase  the tender cap 
radian group set an early participation deadline of pm  new york city time  on march   and holders of notes that validly tender  and do not withdraw their notes  on or before such time will be eligible to receive an additional payment for their early participation 
in the modified dutch auction  the holders of notes indicate how much principal in notes  and at what price within radian group s specified range  they wish to tender 
based on the aggregate principal amount of notes tendered and the prices specified by the tendering note holders  radian group will determine the lowest price per  principal amount of notes within the range that will enable radian group to purchase up to the tender cap or a lower amount if the offer is not fully subscribed 
except for the potential early participation payment  all notes purchased by radian group in the tender offer will be purchased at the same price 
radian group will not purchase notes below a holder s indicated price per  principal amount of notes  and in some cases  radian group may actually purchase notes at a price that is above a holder s indicated price under the terms of the tender offer 
the tender offer is scheduled to expire on march   unless extended or earlier terminated 
the tender offer is conditioned on the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions as described in the offering documents for the tender offer 
subject to applicable law  we may terminate the tender offer if  before such time as any notes have been accepted for payment  any condition of the tender offer is not satisfied or not waived by us 
the tender offer will be financed using a portion of the million of available cash and liquid investments 
tax payments 
under our current tax sharing agreement between radian group and its subsidiaries  our subsidiaries are required to pay to radian group  on a quarterly basis  amounts representing their estimated separate company tax liability for the current tax year 
radian group is required to refund to each subsidiary  any amount that such subsidiary overpaid to radian group for a taxable year  as well as any amount that the subsidiary could utilize through existing carryback provisions of the internal revenue code irc had such subsidiary filed its federal tax return on a separate company basis 
during october  radian group paid approximately million to radian guaranty  which was the maximum amount required to be paid under the tax sharing agreement 
radian group was also obligated to make tax sharing payments during october of approximately million to other subsidiaries within our consolidated group 
we do not expect that radian group will be required to pay any material amounts in under the tax sharing agreement 
our tax sharing agreement may not be changed without the pre approval of the applicable state insurance departments for certain of the insurance subsidiaries that are party to the agreement 
in addition  pursuant to the gses approval of radian mortgage assurance as an eligible mortgage insurer  gse consent is required to modify or amend the tax sharing agreement 
as of the balance sheet date  certain of our insurance subsidiaries  including radian guaranty  have incurred net operating losses nols that could not be carried back and utilized on a separate company tax return basis 
as a result  we are not currently obligated to reimburse these subsidiaries for their separate company nol carryforward 
however  if in a future period our consolidated nol is fully utilized before a subsidiary has utilized its share of nol on a separate entity basis  then radian group may be obligated to fund such subsidiary s share of our consolidated tax liability to the irs 
currently  we do not expect to fund material obligations under the provisions described in this paragraph with regard to subsidiary nols incurred to date 
capital support for subsidiaries 
in light of on going losses in our mortgage insurance business  radian group may be required to make additional capital contributions to radian guaranty in order to support radian guaranty s ability to continue writing insurance in those states that impose certain risk based capital requirements 
radian group contributed approximately million and million to radian guaranty in november and february  respectively  and completed a series of internal transactions in order to benefit radian guaranty s statutory risk based capital position 
in december  radian group contributed its ownership interest in radian mortgage assurance to radian guaranty  which equaled approximately million  and radian guaranty sold its minority ownership interest in efsg  the parent company of cmac of texas  to radian group for approximately million 
radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio was approximately to as of december   after giving effect to all of these transactions  including the february contribution  which was accrued for in radian guaranty s statutory capital as of december  based on our current projections  radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio is expected to increase and  absent any future capital contributions from radian group  is expected to exceed to in in order to maximize our financial flexibility  we have applied for waivers or similar relief for radian guaranty in each of the states that impose risk based capital requirements 
in addition to filing for waivers in these states  we intend to write new first lien mortgage insurance business in radian mortgage assurance in any state that does not permit radian guaranty to continue writing insurance while it is out of compliance with applicable risk based capital requirements 
both of the gses have approved radian mortgage assurance as an eligible mortgage insurer in certain states and subject to certain conditions 
pursuant to these approvals  radian group will be required to contribute million to radian mortgage assurance in the event radian guaranty is not in compliance with the risk based capital requirements in any state and has been unable to obtain a waiver or similar relief from such state 
see risk factors losses in our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty business have reduced radian guaranty s statutory surplus and increased radian guaranty s risk to capital ratio  additional losses in these businesses  without a corresponding increase in new capital or capital relief  would further negatively impact this ratio  which could limit radian guaranty s ability to write new insurance and increase restrictions and requirements placed on radian guaranty in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
radian group also could be required to provide capital support for our other mortgage insurance subsidiaries if additional capital is required pursuant to insurance laws and regulations  by the gses or the rating agencies 
certain of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries that provide reinsurance to radian guaranty currently are operating at or near minimum capital levels and have required  and may continue to require in the future  additional capital contributions from radian group 
in october  radian group contributed approximately million to cmac of texas to satisfy its minimum capital requirements 
as of december   radian group and cmac of texas entered into an assumption and indemnification agreement with regard to certain proposed adjustments resulting from the examination by the irs for the through tax years 
through this agreement  radian group agreed to indemnify cmac of texas for the amount of any tax payments ultimately due to the irs for the proposed adjustments  which relate to the recognition of certain tax losses and deductions that were generated through our investment in a portfolio of remics currently held by cmac of texas 
see risk factors the irs is examining our tax returns for the years through in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
this indemnification was made in lieu of an immediate capital contribution to cmac of texas that otherwise would have been required as a result of our remeasurement  as of december   of uncertain tax positions related to the portfolio of remics 
there remains significant uncertainty with regard to the amount and timing of any resolution with the irs  and we are currently contesting the proposed adjustments related to the remics 
dividends 
our quarterly common stock dividend is per share 
assuming that our outstanding common stock remains constant at  shares the number of shares outstanding at december   we would require approximately million in the aggregate to pay our quarterly dividends for the next months 
in addition to existing available cash and marketable securities  radian group s principal sources of cash include dividends from radian guaranty to the extent permitted under applicable laws and regulations and permitted payments to radian group under tax and expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries 
radian guaranty s ability to pay dividends to radian group is subject to various conditions imposed by the gses and rating agencies  and by insurance regulations requiring insurance department approval 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance department approval 
in light of ongoing losses in radian guaranty  we do not anticipate that it will be permitted under applicable insurance laws to issue dividends to radian group for the foreseeable future 
to the extent radian asset assurance is permitted to issue dividends  these dividends will be issued to its direct parent  radian guaranty  and not to radian group 
in september  radian asset assurance entered into a contingent capital transaction pursuant to which three custodial trusts issued an aggregate of million in cps million by each custodial trust to various holders 
as part of this transaction  radian asset securities inc radian asset securities  our wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a separate perpetual put option agreement with each custodial trust  and radian asset assurance entered into three corresponding perpetual put option agreements with radian asset securities 
radian group and its subsidiaries have purchased by tender offer and privately negotiated transactions  all of the face amount of the cps issued by the custodial trusts 
we expect to ultimately dissolve the custodial trusts  which would result in the distribution of the million in cash held by the custodial trusts to radian group and its non insurance subsidiaries  as a holder of the cps for such custodial trusts 
radian group long term liquidity needs our most significant needs for liquidity beyond the next months are i the repayment of the principal amount of our outstanding long term debt  including approximately million in principal amount due in and million in principal amount due in  and ii potential additional capital contributions to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries 
we may  from time to time  seek to redeem or repurchase  prior to maturity  some or all of our outstanding debt in the open market  through private transactions  one or more tender offers or otherwise  as circumstances may allow 
at this time  we cannot determine the timing or amount of any potential repurchases  which will depend on a number of factors  including our capital and liquidity needs 
if necessary  we may seek to refinance all or a portion of our long term debt  which we may not be able to do on favorable terms  if at all 
pursuant to freddie mac s approval of radian mortgage assurance as a special purpose mortgage insurer  dated february   radian group is required to make contributions to radian guaranty as may be necessary so that the liquid assets of radian guaranty are at least million throughout the term of the approval 
liquid assets are the sum of i aggregate cash and cash equivalents  and ii fair market value of the following investments a residential mortgage backed securities guaranteed by fannie mae  freddie mac or government national mortgage association ginnie mae  b securities rated single a or higher by either moody s  s p or fitch ratings fitch with a remaining maturity of five years or less  and c us treasury securities with maturities not to exceed ten years  provided that  us treasury securities with remaining maturities in excess of five years may not exceed ten percent of the liquid assets 
as of december   liquid assets were approximately billion 
although we do not expect that radian guaranty s liquid assets will fall below million before december   we do expect the amount of liquid assets to continue to decline materially after december   and through the end of and potentially thereafter as radian guaranty s claim payments and other uses of cash continue to exceed cash generated from operations 
we expect to meet the long term liquidity needs of radian group with a combination of i available cash and marketable securities  including  if necessary  million held in the cps trust accounts  ii potential private or public issuances of debt or equity securities  iii potential cash received under expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries  iv the potential sale of assets  and v dividends from our subsidiaries  to the extent available 
see risk factors radian group s sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund its obligations 
mortgage insurance the principal liquidity requirements of our mortgage insurance business include the payment of claims  operating expenses including those allocated from radian group and taxes 
the principal sources of liquidity in our mortgage insurance business are capital contributions from radian group  insurance premiums  net investment income  and cash dividends from radian asset assurance 
our mortgage insurance business has incurred significant losses over the past four years due to the housing and related credit market downturns 
we believe that the operating cash flows generated by each of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries will provide these subsidiaries with a portion of the funds necessary to satisfy their claim payments and operating expenses for the foreseeable future 
we believe that any shortfall can be funded from sales of marketable securities held by our mortgage insurance subsidiaries and from maturing fixed income investments 
as of december   radian asset assurance maintained claims paying resources of billion  including statutory surplus of approximately billion 
in june  radian asset assurance paid an ordinary dividend of million to radian guaranty 
we expect that radian asset assurance will continue to have capacity to pay ordinary dividends to radian guaranty in and  although these dividends are expected to be equal to or below the amounts paid in the amount  if any  and timing of radian asset assurance s dividend paying capacity will depend  in part  on the performance of our insured financial guaranty portfolio  including the establishment of  or change in  statutory reserves  as well as the amount we pay to commute transactions 
if the exposure in our financial guaranty business is reduced on an accelerated basis through the recapture or settlement of business from the primary customers in our financial guaranty reinsurance business or otherwise  we may have the ability to pay dividends to our mortgage insurance business more quickly and in a greater amount 
however  if the performance of our financial guaranty portfolio deteriorates materially  radian asset assurance may have limited or no capacity to pay dividends to radian guaranty 
in the event of a default giving rise to a claim payment obligation in our financial guaranty business  the statutory capital of radian asset assurance and consequently radian guaranty would be reduced in an amount equal to the present value of our expected future net claim liability net of taxes for such transactions 
any significant reduction in statutory capital would also likely reduce radian asset assurance s capacity to pay dividends to radian guaranty  and radian asset assurance could be restricted from paying dividends altogether without prior approval from the new york state insurance department 
financial guaranty the principal short term and long term liquidity requirements of our financial guaranty business include the payment of operating expenses including those allocated from radian group  claim and commutation payments  taxes  and dividends to radian guaranty 
as of december   radian asset assurance had an aggregate of million net par outstanding with respect to seven trups bonds issued under eight cds contracts pursuant to which radian asset assurance could be required under certain circumstances to pay to the counterparty the outstanding par amount of the insured trups bonds a liquidity claim 
a liquidity claim may arise if an event of default under the trups bond eg  a failure to pay interest or a breach of covenants requiring the maintenance of a certain level of performing collateral existed as of the termination date of the cds contract 
the termination dates of these cds contracts currently range between and  but will automatically extend for additional one year increments but no later than the maturity date of the trups cdo unless terminated by the counterparty 
if radian asset assurance is required to pay a liquidity claim  the counterparty would be obligated under the cds to either deliver the insured trups bond to radian asset assurance or to pay radian asset assurance cash periodically in an amount equal to any future amounts paid in respect of principal and interest on the insured trups bond 
the principal sources of liquidity in our financial guaranty business are premium collections  credit enhancement fees on credit derivative contracts and net investment income 
we believe that the cash flows generated by our financial guaranty subsidiaries will provide these subsidiaries with the funds necessary to satisfy their claim payments and operating expenses for the foreseeable future 
we believe that we have the ability to fund any operating cash flow shortfall from sales of marketable securities in our investment portfolio maintained at our operating companies and from maturing fixed income investments 
in the event that we are unable to fund excess claim payments and operating expenses through the sale of these marketable securities and from maturing fixed income investments  we may be required to incur unanticipated capital losses or delays in connection with the sale of less liquid marketable securities held by our financial guaranty business

cash flows used in operating activities for increased slightly compared to  primarily related to increased payments for commutations  terminations and recaptures in during  we received net cash from these transactions due to the termination of several captive arrangements 
the increase in was partially offset by a decrease in net payments related to derivative contracts and vie debt 
during most of  our trading securities activity reflected active and frequent buying and selling  as market prices of our investments strengthened due to improving domestic and global economic environment  and we made the decision to opportunistically realize gains in the investment portfolio 
as such  this activity was reflected as cash flows from operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows during most of beginning in the fourth quarter of  we have classified purchases of trading securities within cash flows from investing activities  since those purchases are more consistent with our overall investment strategy 
we expect that we will use more cash than we generate from operations during the next months 
stockholders equity stockholders equity was billion at december   compared to billion at december  the increase in stockholders equity resulted primarily from our net income of million for ratings radian group and our principal operating subsidiaries have been assigned the financial strength ratings provided in the chart below 
we believe that ratings often are considered by others in assessing our credit strength and the financial strength of our insurance subsidiaries and  historically  it also has been a significant factor in determining radian guaranty s eligibility with the gses 
currently  we include this information only for disclosure related purposes 
see risk factors we could lose our eligibility status with the gses  causing freddie mac and fannie mae to decide not to purchase mortgages insured by us  which would significantly impair our mortgage insurance franchise in item a of part i of this annual report on form k 
moody s s p radian group caa ccc radian guaranty ba b radian insurance b radian mortgage assurance ba b radian asset assurance ba b moody s ratings for radian group and all our rated insurance subsidiaries are currently under review for possible downgrade 
s p s ratings outlook for radian group and all our rated insurance subsidiaries is currently negative 
ratings have been withdrawn 
on august   s p published its updated methodologies and assumptions for rating bond insurers  which significantly re calibrated its bond insurance criteria 
the new criteria  among other things  increases capital requirements  especially to obtain s p s highest ratings  and adds a new leverage test 
on november   as a consequence of these updated methodologies and assumptions  s p downgraded the financial strength ratings of radian asset assurance to b  and maintained its outlook for radian asset assurance as negative 
since radian asset assurance is not currently writing new business and the downgrade has no direct material impact on its existing contracts  we do not anticipate that this downgrade will have a material adverse effect on radian asset assurance 
on november   moody s downgraded radian group s rating to caa from b this downgrade reflects the rating agency s views regarding radian group s current liquidity position and the potential for additional contributions of holding company resources to support our mortgage insurance businesses  as well as our ability to meet our senior debt obligations in the future 
on january   s p downgraded the ratings of radian guaranty and radian mortgage assurance to b from b and also lowered the rating of radian group to ccc from ccc 
these decisions were impacted by the high level of losses in the mortgage insurance sector resulting from an economy that is struggling to recover and that is continuing to exhibit significant weakness in the job and housing markets 
critical accounting policies securities and exchange commission sec guidance defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap  management has made estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized available information  including our past history  industry standards and the current and projected economic and housing environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates  assumptions and judgments  giving due consideration to materiality 
because the use of estimates is inherent in gaap  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is set forth below 
reserve for losses we establish reserves to provide for losses and lae and the estimated costs of settling claims in both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty segments  in accordance with the accounting standard regarding accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
although this standard specifically excludes mortgage insurance from its guidance relating to the reserve for losses  it does not provide any other specific guidance 
therefore  because of the lack of specific guidance  we establish reserves for mortgage insurance using the guidance contained in this standard  supplemented with other accounting guidance as described below 
estimating the loss reserves in both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty business segments involves significant reliance upon assumptions and estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of each potential loss 
the models  assumptions and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate  especially during an extended economic downturn or a period of extreme market volatility and uncertainty such as currently exists 
as such  we cannot be certain that our established reserves will be adequate to cover ultimate losses on incurred defaults 
commutations  recaptures and other negotiated terminations of our insured risks in both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty segments provide us with an opportunity to exit exposures to entire policies with insureds and reinsureds for an agreed upon payment  or payments  often at a discount to the previously estimated ultimate liability 
as a result of exiting all exposures to such policies  all reserves for losses and lae and other balances relating to the insured or reinsured policy are eliminated 
upon completion of a commutation  recapture or other negotiated termination  all such related balances  including deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned premiums  are reversed  with any remaining net gain or loss typically recorded through provision for losses 
we take into consideration the specific contractual and economic terms for each individual agreement when accounting for our commutations  recaptures  or other negotiated terminations  which may result in differences in the accounting between transactions  or between our statutory financial statements and financial statements presented on a gaap basis 
mortgage insurance in the mortgage insurance segment  reserves for losses are established upon receipt of notification by servicers that a borrower has missed two monthly payments 
we also establish reserves for associated lae  consisting of the estimated cost of the claims administration process  including legal and other fees and expenses associated with administering the claims process 
we maintain an extensive database of claim payment history and use models  based on a variety of loan characteristics  including the status of the loan as reported by its servicer and the type of loan product to determine the likelihood that a default will reach claim status 
our process includes forecasting the impact of our loss mitigation efforts in protecting us against fraud  underwriting negligence  breach of representation and warranties  inadequate documentation and other items that may give rise to insurance rescissions and claim denials  to help determine the default to claim rate 
lastly  we project the amount that we will pay if a default becomes a claim referred to as claim severity 
based on these estimates  we arrive at our estimate of loss reserves at a given point in time 
the default and claim cycle in our mortgage insurance business begins with our receipt of a default notice from the servicer 
for financial statement reporting and internal tracking purposes  we do not consider a loan to be in default until the borrower has missed two monthly payments 
with respect to loans that are in default  considerable judgment is exercised as to the adequacy of reserve levels 
loss reserves are increased as defaulted loans age  because they are considered to be closer to foreclosure and more likely to result in a claim payment 
in the past  as the default proceeded towards foreclosure  there was generally more certainty around these estimates 
however  in light of existing foreclosure backlogs and efforts to increase loan modifications among defaulted borrowers  significantly more uncertainty remains regarding current estimates with respect to the later stage defaults than was historically typical 
this uncertainty requires management to use considerable judgment in estimating the rate at which these loans will result in claims 
if a default cures  the reserve for that loan is removed from the reserve for losses and lae 
we also establish reserves for defaults that we estimate have been incurred but have not been reported to us on a timely basis by the servicer  and for defaults related to previously rescinded policies and denied claims which are likely to be reinstated in the case of previously rescinded policies or resubmitted in the case of previously denied claims 
our estimates of amounts related to reinstatements and resubmissions are included in ibnr 
due to the period of time generally up to days that we give the insured to rebut our decision to rescind coverage before we consider a policy to be rescinded and removed from our default inventory  we currently expect only a limited percentage of policies that were rescinded to ultimately be reinstated 
we currently expect a greater percentage of claims that were denied to ultimately be resubmitted as a perfected claim and paid 
most often  a claim denial is the result of the servicer s inability to provide the loan origination file or other servicing documents for review 
under the terms of our master policy  our insureds have up to one year after foreclosure to provide to us the necessary documents to perfect a claim 
all estimates are periodically reviewed and adjustments are made as they become necessary 
we do not establish reserves for loans that are in default if we believe that we will not be liable for the payment of a claim with respect to that default 
for example  for those defaults in which we are in a second loss position  we initially calculate the reserve for defaulted loans in the transaction as if there were no deductible 
if the existing deductible for a given structured transaction is greater than the reserve amount for the defaults contained within the transaction  we do not establish a reserve for the defaults  or if appropriate  we record only a partial reserve 
we do not establish loss reserves for expected future claims on insured mortgages that are not in default 
see reserve for premium deficiency below for an exception to this general principle 
for purposes of reserve modeling  loans are aggregated into groups using a variety of factors 
the attributes used to define the groups include  but are not limited to  the default status of the loans ie  number of days in default  product type ie  prime  alt a  or subprime  type of insurance ie  primary or pool  vintage year  loss position ie  with or without a deductible  and the state where the property is located segregated into three state groups in order to adjust for differences in foreclosure timing 
we use an actuarial projection methodology referred to as a roll rate analysis that uses historical claim frequency information to determine the projected ultimate default to claim rates for each product and default status 
the default to claim rate also includes our estimates with respect to expected insurance rescissions and claim denials  which have the effect of reducing our default to claim rates 
in recent years  we have experienced an elevated level of insurance rescissions and claim denials for various reasons  including  without limitation  underwriting negligence  fraudulent applications and appraisals  breach of representations and warranties  and inadequate documentation  reflecting the poor underwriting periods of through after estimating the default to claim rate  we estimate the severity of each product type  type of insurance  and state grouping based on the average of recently observed severity rates 
these average severity estimates are then applied to individual loan coverage amounts to determine reserves 
our aggregate weighted average default to claim rate assumption net of denials and rescissions used in estimating our reserve for losses was at december   compared to at december  the increase from december   to december   was primarily attributable to an increase in the weighted average age of underlying defaulted loans and a decrease in our estimate of rescissions and denials for our default inventory as of december  our default to claim rate estimate varies depending on the age of the underlying defaulted loans  as measured by the number of monthly payments missed 
as of december   our default to claim rate estimate  net of our estimate for insurance rescissions and claim denials  ranged from for insured loans that had missed two to three monthly payments  to for such loans that had missed or more monthly payments 
a key assumption affecting our reserving methodology is that our default to claim rates and severities will be consistent with our recent experience 
our estimate of expected insurance rescissions and claim denials embedded in our default to claim rate is generally based on our experience over the past year  with consideration given for differences in characteristics between those rescinded policies and denied claims and the remaining default inventory 
we expect our rescission and denial rates to remain at elevated levels as long as defaults related to the poor underwriting periods of through represent a significant percentage of our total default portfolio 
the elevated levels in the rate of rescissions and denials since have led to an increased risk of litigation by lenders and policyholders challenging our right to rescind coverage or deny claims 
under our master insurance policy  any suit or action arising from any right of the insured under the policy must be commenced within two years after such right first arose and within three years for certain other policies  including certain pool insurance policies 
recently  we have faced an increasing number of challenges from certain lender customers regarding our insurance rescissions and claim denials  which have resulted in some reversals of our decisions regarding rescissions and denials 
although we believe that our rescissions and denials are justified under our policies  if we are not successful in defending the rescissions and denials in any potential legal or other actions  we may need to reassume the risk on  and increase loss reserves for  those policies or pay additional claims 
the assumptions embedded in our estimated default to claim rate on our in force default inventory includes an adjustment to our estimated rescission and denial rate  to account for the fact that we expect a certain number of policies for which an initial intent to rescind letter has been sent to our lender customers to remain in force and ultimately to be paid  as a result of valid challenges by such policy holders during the limited period specified in such letters 
as discussed above  we also establish reserves for ibnr defaults related to previously rescinded policies and denied claims which we believe are likely to be reinstated in the case of previously rescinded policies  or resubmitted in the case of previously denied claims 
we considered the sensitivity of first lien loss reserve estimates at december   by assessing the potential changes resulting from a parallel shift in severity and default to claim rate 
for example  assuming all other factors remain constant  for every one percentage point change in primary claim severity which we estimate to be of unpaid principal balance at december   we estimated that our loss reserves would change by approximately million at december  for every one percentage point change in pool claim severity which we estimate to be of unpaid principal balance at december   we estimated that our loss reserves would change by approximately million at december  for every one percentage point change in our overall default to claim rate which we estimate to be at december   including our assumptions related to rescissions and denials  we estimated a million change in our loss reserves at december  financial guaranty in our financial guaranty segment  we recognize a claim liability on our non derivative transactions prior to an event of default insured event when there is evidence that credit deterioration has occurred for a particular policy and the present value of the expected claim loss exceeds the unearned premium revenue 
the expected claim loss is based on the probability weighted present value of expected net cash outflows to be paid under  or in connection with  the policy 
in measuring the claim liability  we develop the present value of expected net cash outflows by using our own assumptions about the likelihood of possible outcomes  including potential settlements or commutations  based on information currently available 
we determine the existence of credit deterioration on directly insured policies based on periodic reporting from the insured party  indenture trustee or servicer  and based on our surveillance efforts 
these expected cash outflows are discounted using a risk free rate 
our assumptions about the likelihood of outcomes  expected cash outflows and the appropriate risk free rate are updated each reporting period 
for assumed policies  we use information provided by the ceding company  as well as our specific knowledge of the credit for determining expected loss 
the risk management function in our financial guaranty business is responsible for the identification  analysis  measurement and surveillance of credit  market  legal and operational risk associated with our financial guaranty insurance contracts 
risk management is also primarily responsible for claims prevention and loss mitigation strategies 
this discipline is applied during the ongoing monitoring and surveillance of each exposure in the portfolio 
there are both performing and under performing credits in our financial guaranty portfolio 
performing credits generally have investment grade internal ratings  denoting nominal to moderate credit risk 
however  claim liabilities may be established for performing credits if the expected losses on the credit exceed the unearned premium revenue for the contract based on the present value of the expected net cash outflows 
if our risk management department concludes that a directly insured transaction should no longer be considered performing  it is placed in one of three designated watch list categories for deteriorating credits special mention  intensified surveillance or case reserve 
assumed exposures in financial guaranty s reinsurance portfolio are generally placed in one of these categories if the ceding company for such transaction downgrades it to an equivalent watch list classification 
however  should our financial guaranty risk management group disagree with the risk rating assigned by the ceding company  we may assign our own risk rating rather than use the risk rating assigned by the ceding company 
reserve for premium deficiency pdr insurance enterprises are required to establish a pdr if the net present value of the expected future losses and expenses for a particular product exceeds the net present value of expected future premiums and existing reserves for that product 
we reassess our expectations for premiums  losses and expenses for our financial guaranty and mortgage insurance businesses at least quarterly and update our premium deficiency analysis accordingly 
expected future expenses include consideration of maintenance costs associated with maintaining records relating to insurance contracts and with the processing of premium collections 
we also consider investment income in the premium deficiency calculation  and utilize our pre tax investment yield to discount certain cash flows for this analysis 
for our financial guaranty business  in order to determine whether a premium deficiency charge is necessary  we compare projected earned premiums and investment income to projected future losses  lae  unamortized deferred acquisition costs and maintenance costs 
if the sum of the costs exceeds the amount of the revenues  the excess is first charged against deferred acquisition costs and is referred to as a premium deficiency charge 
for purposes of our premium deficiency analysis  we group our mortgage insurance products into two categories  first lien and second lien 
numerous factors affect our ultimate default to claim rates  including home price changes  unemployment and the impact of our loss mitigation efforts and interest rates  as well as potential benefits associated with lender and governmental initiatives to modify loans and ultimately reduce foreclosures 
to assess the need for a pdr on our first lien insurance portfolio  we develop loss projections based on modeled loan defaults related to our current rif 
this projection is based on recent trends in default experience  severity  and rates of defaulted loans moving to claim such default to claim rates are net of our estimates of rescissions and denials  as well as recent trends in the rate at which loans are prepaid 
as of december   our modeled loan default projections for our first lien insured portfolio assume that the rate at which current loans will default will remain consistent for the next twelve months with those rates observed during  and then gradually return to normal historical levels over the subsequent three years 
for our first lien insurance business  because the combination of the net present value of expected premiums and already established reserves net of reinsurance recoverables exceeds the net present value of expected losses and expenses  a first lien pdr was not required as of december  our pre tax investment yield used as the discount rate in these present value calculations was and as of december  and  respectively 
expected losses are based on an assumed paid claim rate of approximately on our total first lien insurance portfolio on performing loans and on defaulted loans 
assuming all other factors remained constant  if our paid claim rate increased from to  we would be required to establish a premium deficiency reserve 
new business originated since the beginning of is expected to be profitable  which has contributed to the overall expected net profitability of our first lien portfolio 
in addition  estimated rescissions and denials on insured loans are expected to partially offset the impact of expected defaults and claims 
our expectations regarding the future net profitability of our total first lien mortgage insurance portfolio have decreased significantly as of december   compared to our expectations at december   primarily due to our revised expectations regarding future macroeconomic conditions 
as a result  the possibility of a future pdr on our first lien mortgage insurance business has increased 
for our second lien mortgage insurance business  we project future premiums and losses for this business on a transaction by transaction basis  using historical results to help determine future performance for both repayments and claims 
an estimated expense factor is then applied  and the result is discounted using a rate of return that approximates our investment yield 
this net present value  less any existing reserves  is recorded as a premium deficiency and the reserve is updated at least quarterly based on actual results for that quarter  along with updated transaction level projections 
evaluating the expected profitability of our existing mortgage insurance business and the need for a premium deficiency reserve for our first lien business involves significant reliance upon assumptions and estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of potential losses and premium revenues 
the models  assumptions and estimates we use to evaluate the need for a premium deficiency reserve may not prove to be accurate  especially during an extended economic downturn or a period of extreme market volatility and uncertainty such as currently exists 
we cannot be certain that we have correctly estimated the expected profitability of our existing first lien mortgage portfolio or that the second lien pdr established will be adequate to cover the ultimate losses on our second lien business 
fair value of financial instruments our estimated fair value measurements are intended to reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available 
assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique such as a pricing model and the risks inherent in the inputs to the model 
changes in economic conditions and capital market conditions  including but not limited to  credit spread changes  benchmark interest rate changes  market volatility and declines in the value of underlying collateral  could cause actual results to differ materially from our estimated fair value measurements 
we define fair value as the current amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in the event that our investments or derivative contracts were sold  commuted  terminated or settled with a counterparty  or transferred in a forced liquidation  the amounts received or paid may be materially different from those determined in accordance with the accounting standard regarding fair value measurements 
differences may arise between our recorded fair value and the settlement or termination value with a counterparty based upon consideration of information that may not be available to another market participant 
those differences  which may be material  are recorded as transaction realized gains losses in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the transaction occurs 
we have included the additional disclosures required by the update to the accounting standard regarding fair value measurements and disclosures pertaining to the reconciliation of level iii fair value measurements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
when determining the fair value of our liabilities  we are required to incorporate into the fair value of those liabilities an adjustment that reflects our own non performance risk 
our cds spread is an observable quantitative measure of our non performance risk and is used by typical market participants to determine the likelihood of our default 
as our cds spread tightens or widens  it has the effect of increasing or decreasing  respectively  the fair value of our liabilities 
we established a fair value hierarchy by prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level i measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level iii measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under this standard are described below level i unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities  level ii prices or valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical or similar assets and liabilities  and level iii prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable 
the level of market activity used in determining the fair value hierarchy is based on the availability of observable inputs market participants would use to price an asset or a liability  including market value price observations 
for markets in which inputs are not observable or limited  we use significant judgment and assumptions that a typical market participant would use to evaluate the market price of an asset or liability 
given the level of judgment  another market participant may derive a materially different estimate of fair value 
these assets and liabilities are classified in level iii of our fair value hierarchy 
a financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
at december   our total level iii assets were approximately of total assets measured at fair value and total level iii liabilities accounted for of total liabilities measured at fair value 
available for sale securities  trading securities  vie debt  derivative instruments  and certain other assets are recorded at fair value as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
all derivative instruments and contracts are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets as either derivative assets or derivative liabilities 
all changes in fair value of trading securities  vie debt  derivative instruments  and certain other assets are included in our consolidated statements of operations 
all changes in the fair value of available for sale securities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the following are descriptions of our valuation methodologies for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
investments us government and agency securities the fair value of us government and agency securities is estimated using observed market transactions  including broker dealer quotes and actual trade activity as a basis for valuation 
us government and agency securities are categorized in either level i or level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
state and municipal obligations the fair value of state and municipal obligations is estimated using recent transaction activity  including market and market like observations 
evaluation models are used  which incorporate bond structure  yield curve  credit spreads  and other factors 
these securities are generally categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy or in level iii when market based transaction activity is unavailable 
money market instruments the fair value of money market instruments is based on daily prices  which are published and available to all potential investors and market participants 
as such  these securities are categorized in level i of the fair value hierarchy 
corporate bonds and notes the fair value of corporate bonds and notes is estimated using recent transaction activity  including market and market like observations 
spread models are used that incorporate issuer and structure characteristics  such as credit risk and early redemption features  where applicable 
these securities are generally categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy or in level iii when market based transaction activity is unavailable 
rmbs the fair value of rmbs is estimated based on prices of comparable securities and spreads  and observable prepayment speeds 
these securities are generally categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy or in level iii when market based transaction activity is unavailable 
the fair value of the level iii securities is generally estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows 
cmbs the fair value of cmbs is estimated based on prices of comparable securities and spreads  and observable prepayment speeds 
these securities are generally categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy or in level iii when market based transaction activity is unavailable 
the fair value of the level iii securities is generally estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows 
cdo these securities are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
the fair value of the level iii securities is generally estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows 
other abs the fair value of other abs is estimated based on prices of comparable securities and spreads  and observable prepayment speeds 
these securities are generally categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy or in level iii when market based transaction activity is unavailable 
the fair value of the level iii securities is generally estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows 
foreign government securities the fair value of foreign government securities is estimated using observed market yields used to create a maturity curve and observed credit spreads from market makers and broker dealers 
these securities are categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
hybrid securities these instruments are convertible securities 
the estimated fair value is derived  in part  by utilizing dealer quotes and observed bond and stock prices 
for certain securities  the underlying security price may be adjusted to account for observable changes in the conversion and investment value from the time the quote was obtained 
these securities are categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
equity securities the fair value of these securities is generally estimated using observable market data in active markets or bid prices from market makers and broker dealers 
generally  these securities are categorized in level i or ii of the fair value hierarchy  as observable market data is readily available 
a small number of our equity securities  however  are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy due to a lack of market based transaction data or the use of model based evaluations 
other investments these securities primarily consist of short term commercial paper within cps trusts and short term certificates of deposit  which are categorized in level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
the fair value of the remaining securities is categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy  and is generally estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows 
we are responsible for the determination of the value of all investments carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions 
to assist us in this responsibility  we utilize independent third party valuation service providers to gather  analyze  and interpret market information and estimate fair values based upon relevant methodologies and assumptions for various asset classes and individual securities 
we perform monthly quantitative and qualitative analysis on the prices received from third parties to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value 
our analysis includes i a review of the methodology used by third party pricing services  ii a comparison of pricing services valuations to other independent sources  iii a review of month to month price fluctuations  and iv a comparison of actual purchase and sale transactions with valuations received from third parties 
these processes are designed to ensure that our investment values are accurately recorded  that the data inputs and valuation techniques utilized are appropriate and consistently applied  and that the assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value 
derivative instruments and related vie assets liabilities we define fair value as the current amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability  other than in a forced liquidation 
in determining an exit market  we consider the fact that most of our derivative contracts are unconditional and irrevocable  and contractually prohibit us from transferring them to other capital market participants 
accordingly  there is no principal market for such highly structured insured credit derivatives 
in the absence of a principal market  we value these insured credit derivatives in a hypothetical market where market participants include other monoline mortgage and financial guaranty insurers with similar credit quality to us  as if the risk of loss on these contracts could be transferred to these other mortgage and financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance companies 
we believe that in the absence of a principal market  this hypothetical market provides the most relevant information with respect to fair value estimates 
we determine the fair value of our derivative instruments primarily using internally generated models 
we utilize market observable inputs  such as credit spreads on similar products  whenever they are available 
when one of our transactions develops characteristics that are inconsistent with the characteristics of transactions that underlie the relevant market based index that we use in our credit spread valuation approach  and more relevant inputs or projections become available that we believe would represent the view of a typical market participant  we change to an approach that is based on that more relevant available information 
this change in approach is generally prompted when the credit component  and not market factors  becomes the dominant driver of the estimated fair value for a particular transaction 
there is a high degree of uncertainty about our fair value estimates since our contracts are not traded or exchanged  which makes external validation and corroboration of our estimates difficult  particularly given the current market environment  in which very few  if any  contracts are being traded or originated 
in very limited recent instances  we have negotiated terminations of financial guaranty contracts with our counterparties and believe that such terminations provide relevant data with respect to validating our fair value estimates and such data has been generally consistent with our fair value estimates 
our derivative liabilities valuation methodology incorporates our own non performance risk by including our observable cds spread as an input into the determination of the fair value of our derivative liabilities 
considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates may not be indicative of amounts we could realize in a current market exchange or negotiated termination 
our derivative liability valuation is not counterparty specific and is intended to estimate the average exchange price between typical participants 
the use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts or negotiated terminations 
in a negotiated termination  certain factors unique to the counterparty may have a greater impact on the amount exchanged than in an estimated fair value amount between typical market participants  and another market participant could have materially different views given the level of judgment associated with the valuation 
corporate cdos the fair value of each of our corporate cdo transactions is estimated based on the difference between the present value of the expected future contractual premiums we charge  and the fair premium amount that we estimate that another financial guarantor would require to assume the rights and obligations under our contracts 
the fair value estimates reflect the fair value of the asset or liability  which is consistent with the in exchange approach  in which fair value is determined based on the price that would be received or paid in a current transaction as defined by the accounting standard regarding fair value measurements 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
present value of expected future contractual premiums our contractual premiums are subject to change primarily for two reasons all of our contracts provide our counterparties with the right to terminate upon our default  and of the aggregate net par outstanding of our corporate cdo transactions as of december  provide our counterparties with the right to terminate these transactions based on certain rating agency downgrades that occurred during in determining the expected future premiums of these transactions  we adjust the contractual premiums for such transactions to reflect the estimated fair value of those premiums based on our estimate of the probability of our counterparties exercising this downgrade termination right and the impact it would have on the remaining expected lifetime premium 
we also cap the total estimated fair value of the contracts subject to termination at zero  such that none of these contracts are in a derivative asset position 
as of december   of the aggregate net par outstanding of our corporate cdo transactions were capped in this manner 
the discount rate we use to determine the present value of expected future premiums is our cds spread plus a risk free rate 
this discount rate reflects the risk that we may not collect future premiums due to our inability to satisfy our contractual obligations  which provides our counterparties the right to terminate the contracts 
determining the fair premium amount for each corporate cdo transaction  we perform three principal steps in determining the fair premium amount first  we define a tranche on the cdx index defined below that equates to the risk profile of our specific transaction we refer to this tranche as an equivalent risk tranche  second  we determine the fair premium amount on the equivalent risk tranche for those market participants engaged in trading on the cdx index we refer to each of these participants as a typical market participant  and third  we adjust the fair premium amount for a typical market participant to account for the difference between the non performance or default risk of a typical market participant and the non performance or default risk of a financial guarantor of similar credit quality to us in each case  we refer to the risk of non performance as non performance risk 
defining the equivalent risk tranche direct observations of fair premium amounts for our transactions are not available since these transactions cannot be traded or transferred pursuant to their terms and there is currently no active market for these transactions 
however  cdss on tranches of a standardized index the cdx index are widely traded and observable  and provide relevant market data for determining the fair premium amount of our transactions  as described more fully below 
the cdx index is an index based on a synthetic corporate cdo that comprises a list of corporate obligors and is segmented into multiple tranches of synthetic senior unsecured debt of these obligors ranging from the equity tranche ie  the most credit risk or first loss position to the most senior tranche ie  the least credit risk 
we refer to each of these tranches as a standard cdx tranche 
a tranche is defined by an attachment point and detachment point  representing the range of portfolio losses for which the protection seller would be required to make a payment 
our corporate cdo transactions possess similar structural features to the standard cdx tranches  but often differ with respect to the referenced corporate entities  the term  the attachment points and the detachment points 
therefore  in order to determine the equivalent risk tranche for each of our corporate cdo transactions  we determine the attachment and detachment points on the cdx index that have comparable estimated probabilities of loss as the attachment and detachment points in our transactions 
we begin by performing a simulation analysis of referenced entity defaults in our transactions to determine the probability of portfolio losses exceeding our attachment and detachment points 
the referenced entity defaults are primarily determined based on the following inputs the market observed cds credit spreads of the referenced corporate entities  the correlations between each of the referenced corporate entities  and the term of the transaction 
for each referenced corporate entity in our corporate cdo transactions  the cds spreads associated with the term of our transactions credit curve define the estimated expected loss for each entity as applied in a market standard approach known as risk neutral modeling 
the credit curves on individual referenced entities are generally observable 
the expected cumulative loss for the portfolio of referenced entities associated with each of our transactions is the sum of the expected losses of these individual referenced entities 
with respect to the correlation of losses across the underlying referenced entities  two obligors belonging to the same industry or located in the same geographical region are assumed to have a higher probability of defaulting together ie  they are more correlated 
an increase in the correlations between the referenced entities generally causes a higher expected loss for the portfolio associated with our transactions 
the estimated correlation factors that we use are derived internally based on observable third party inputs that are based on historical data 
the impact of our correlation assumptions currently does not have a material effect on our fair premium estimates in light of the significant impact of our non performance risk adjustment as described below 
once we have established the probability of portfolio losses exceeding the attachment and detachment points in our transactions  we then use the same simulation method to locate the attachment and detachment points on the cdx index with comparable probabilities 
these equivalent attachment and detachment points define the equivalent risk tranche on the cdx index that we use to determine fair premium amounts 
determining the typical fair premium amount the equivalent risk tranches for our corporate cdo transactions often are not identical to any standard cdx tranches 
as a result  fair premium amounts generally are not directly observable from the cdx index for the equivalent risk tranche and must be separately determined 
we make this determination through an interpolation in which we use the observed premium rates on the standard cdx tranches that most closely match our equivalent risk tranche to derive the typical fair premium amount for the equivalent risk tranche 
non performance risk adjustment on corporate cdos the typical fair premium amount estimated for the equivalent risk tranche represents the fair premium amount for a typical market participant not radian 
accordingly  the final step in our fair value estimation is to convert this typical fair premium amount into a fair premium amount for a financial guarantor of similar credit quality to us 
a typical market participant is contractually bound by a requirement that collateral be posted regularly to minimize the impact of that participant s default or non performance 
this collateral posting feature makes these transactions less risky to the protection buyer  and therefore  priced differently 
none of our contracts require us to post collateral with our counterparties  which exposes our counterparties fully to our non performance risk 
we make an adjustment to the typical fair premium amount to account for both this contractual difference  as well as for the market s perception of our default probability  which is observable through our cds spread 
the amount of the non performance risk adjustment is computed based  in part  on the expected claim payment by radian 
to estimate this expected payment  we first determine the expected claim payment of a typical market participant by using a risk neutral modeling approach 
a significant underlying assumption of the risk neutral model approach that we use is that the typical fair premium amount is equal to the present value of expected claim payments from a typical market participant 
expected claim payments on a transaction are based on the expected loss on that transaction also determined using the risk neutral modeling approach 
radian s expected claim payment is calculated based on the correlation between the default probability of the transaction and our default probability 
the default probability of radian is determined from the observed radian group cds spread  and the default probability of the transaction is determined as described above under defining the equivalent risk tranche 
the present value of radian s expected claim payments is discounted using a risk free interest rate  as the expected claim payments have already been risk adjusted 
the reduction in our fair premium amount related to our non performance risk is limited to a minimum fair premium amount  which is determined based on our estimate of the minimum fair premium that a market participant would require to assume the risks of our obligations 
approximately of our corporate cdo contracts as of december  are subject to this minimum fair premium 
our non performance risk adjustment currently results in a material reduction of our typical fair premium amounts  which in turn has a positive impact on the fair value of these derivatives 
non corporate cdos and other derivative transactions our non corporate cdo transactions include our guaranty of trups cdos  cdos of abs  cdos of cmbs  and cdos backed by other asset classes such as i municipal securities  ii synthetic financial guarantees of abs  and iii project finance transactions 
the fair value of our non corporate cdos and other derivative transactions is calculated as the difference between the present value of the expected future contractual premiums and our estimate of the fair premium amount for these transactions 
the present value of expected future contractual premiums is determined based on the methodology described above for corporate cdos 
the contractual premiums associated with of the aggregate net par outstanding of our non corporate cdo contracts are subject to change due to counterparties being provided the right to terminate these transactions based on certain rating agency downgrades that occurred during we also cap the total estimated fair value of the contracts subject to termination at zero  such that none of these contracts are in a derivative asset position 
as of december   of the aggregate net par outstanding of our non corporate cdo transactions were capped in this manner 
for our credit card transactions  the fair premium amount is estimated using observed spreads on recent trades of securities that are similar to the securities that we guaranty 
in all other instances  we utilize internal models to estimate the fair premium amount as described below 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
trups cdos our trups transactions are cdss on cdos where the collateral consists primarily of deeply subordinated securities issued by banks  insurance companies  real estate investment trusts and other financial institutions whose individual spreads are not observable 
in each case  we provide credit protection on a specific tranche of each cdo 
to determine fair value for these transactions  we use a discounted cash flow valuation approach that captures the credit characteristics of each transaction 
we estimate projected claims based on our internal credit analysis  which is based on the current performance of each underlying reference obligation 
the present value of the expected cash flows to the trups transaction is then determined using a discount rate derived from the observed market pricing for a trups transaction with similar characteristics 
the present value of the insured cash flows is determined using a discount rate that is equal to our cds rate plus a risk free rate 
for certain of our trups transactions  our counterparties may require that we pay them the outstanding par on the underlying trups bond if an event of default has occurred and remains outstanding as of the termination date of our cds coverage a conditional liquidity claim 
for these transactions  an additional fair value adjustment is made 
to calculate this adjustment  a probability that we will be required to pay a conditional liquidity claim is assigned based on our internal cash flow projections 
a discounted cash flow valuation is also performed for this scenario where we are required to make a conditional liquidity claim 
the fair value is set equal to the probability weighted average of the valuations from the two scenarios one in which our counterparty makes a conditional liquidity claim and one in which the claim is not made 
cdos of abs  including related vie liabilities the fair value amounts for our cdos of abs transactions are derived using standard market indices and discounted cash flows  to the extent expected losses can be estimated 
one of our cdo of abs transactions matured during  requiring no payment by us 
the investment securities for the remaining cdo of abs transaction  which is consolidated  have experienced significant credit deterioration 
fair value for these securities is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
we estimate cash flows for the transaction based on our internal credit analysis  which is based on the current performance of each security 
the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral securities is determined using either observed market transactions  including broker dealer quotes and actual trade activity on similar bonds  or expected cash flows discounted using the yield observed on similar bonds 
the present value of the insured cash flows which represents the vie debt is determined using a risk free rate that is applied to the cash flows adjusted for radian s non performance risk 
we continue to utilize this model to estimate the fair value of our exposure  and to derive the fair value of this consolidated vie debt 
the vie debt and derivative liability within this cdo of abs transaction are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
our maximum principal exposure to loss from this cdo of abs transaction is million at december   which reflects principal due in the recorded net fair value of our consolidated assets and liabilities related to this consolidated cdo of abs as of december   was less than our maximum principal exposure 
the fair value of the vie debt and other liabilities exceeds the net value of the assets of the vie  however  because our fair value estimate of the vie debt incorporates a discount rate that is based on our cds spread  the fair value is substantially less than our expected ultimate claim payments 
cdos of cmbs the fair premium amounts for our cdos of cmbs transactions for a typical market participant are derived first by observing the spreads of the cmbx indices that match the underlying reference obligations of our transactions 
a mezzanine tranche  which represents our insured tranche  is then priced through a standard cdo model 
the cmbx indices represent standardized lists of cmbs reference obligations 
a different cmbx index exists for different types of underlying referenced obligations based on vintages and credit rating 
for each of our cdo of cmbs transactions  we use the cmbx index that most directly correlates to our transaction with respect to vintage and credit rating 
because the observable cmbs indices do not have a similar mezzanine tranche  we use an internal cdo pricing model in order to adjust fair value for this structural feature 
a standard cdo pricing model was calibrated to establish the market pricing at inception 
this cdo pricing model is then applied to the current valuation period to derive the fair premium for the mezzanine tranche 
the typical fair premium amount represents the estimated fair value of the expected future fair premiums determined by using a discount rate equal to the cds spread of a typical market participant plus a risk free rate 
all other non corporate cdos and other derivative transactions for all of our other non corporate cdo and other derivative transactions  observed prices and market indices are not available 
as a result  we utilize an internal model that estimates fair premium 
the fair premium amount is calculated such that the expected profit fair premium amount net of expected losses and other expenses is proportional to an internally developed risk based capital amount 
expected losses and our internally developed risk based capital amounts are projected by our model using the internal credit rating  term  and current par outstanding for each transaction 
for each of the non corporate cdos and other derivative transactions discussed above  with the exception of cdos of abs and trups transactions that are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis  we make an adjustment to the fair premium amounts  as described above under non performance risk adjustments on corporate cdos  to incorporate our own non performance risk 
the non performance risk adjustment associated with our cdos of abs and our trups transactions is incorporated in the fair value as described above  therefore  no separate adjustment is required 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
assumed financial guaranty credit derivatives in making our determination of fair value for these credit derivatives  we use information provided to us by our counterparties to these reinsurance transactions  which are the primary insurers the primaries of the underlying credits  including the primaries fair valuations for these credits 
the information obtained from our counterparties is not received with sufficient time for us to refine our estimates of the mark to market liability as of the balance sheet date 
therefore  the amount recorded as of december   is based on the most recent available financial information  which is reported on a quarterly lag 
the lag in reporting is consistent from period to period 
the fair value is based on credit spreads obtained by the primaries from market data sources published by third parties eg  dealer spread tables for collateral similar to assets within the transactions being valued as well as collateral specific spreads provided by trustees or obtained from market sources if such data is available 
if observable market spreads are not available or reliable for the underlying reference obligations  then the primaries valuations are predominantly based on market indices that most closely resemble the underlying reference obligations  considering asset class  credit quality rating and maturity of the underlying reference obligations 
in addition  these valuations incorporate an adjustment for non performance risk 
the primaries models used to estimate the fair value of these instruments include a number of factors  including credit spreads  changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of referenced entities 
in establishing our fair value for these transactions  we assess the reasonableness of the primaries valuations by reviewing the primaries publicly available information regarding their mark to market processes  including methodology and key assumptions  and analyzing and discussing the changes in fair value with the primaries where the changes appear unusual or do not appear materially consistent with credit loss related information when provided by the primaries for these transactions 
these credit derivatives are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
other financial guaranty vie consolidated assets liabilities we are the primary beneficiary for two other vies for which we have provided financial guarantees 
these vies primarily consist of manufactured housing loans and vie debt to noteholders in the trust 
the fair value of the vie debt related to these other financial guaranty vies is estimated based on prices of comparable securities and spreads observed in the market 
the overall net fair value for these transactions is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
we do not currently estimate any projected claims based on our internal credit analysis  which is based on the current performance of the underlying collateral and the remaining subordination available to support the transaction 
the present value of the insured cash flows is determined by using a discount rate that is equal to our cds rate plus a risk free rate 
we utilize this model to determine the fair value of our exposure to these vies  and to derive the fair value of the assets in these vies  which are reported within other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
the assets and vie debt related to these transactions are categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
our maximum principal exposure to loss from these transactions is million  however  we do not currently expect to pay any claims related to these two vies 
at december   we recorded million of other assets  million of vie debt and million of accounts payable and accrued expenses associated with these two vies 
nims credit derivatives  nims derivative assets and nims vie debt nims credit derivatives are financial guarantees that we have issued on nims 
nims derivative assets primarily represent derivative assets in the nims trusts that we are required to consolidate 
nims vie debt represents the debt of consolidated nims trusts  which we account for at fair value 
the estimated fair value amounts of these financial instruments are derived from internally generated discounted cash flow models 
we estimate losses in each securitization underlying either the nims credit derivatives  nims derivative assets or nims vie debt by applying expected default rates separately to loans that are delinquent and those that are paying currently 
these default rates are based on historical experience of similar transactions 
we then estimate the rate of prepayments on the underlying collateral in each securitization  incorporating historical prepayment experience 
the estimated loss and rate of prepayments are used to estimate the cash flows for each underlying securitization and nims bond  and ultimately  to produce the projected credit losses for each nims bond 
in addition to expected credit losses  we consider the future expected premiums to be received from the nims trust for each credit derivative 
the projected net losses are then discounted using a rate of return that incorporates our own non performance risk  and based on our current cds spread  results in a reduction of the derivative liability 
since nims guarantees are not market traded instruments  considerable judgment is required in estimating fair value 
the use of different assumptions and or methodologies could have a material effect on estimated fair values 
the nims credit derivatives  nims derivative assets and nims vie debt are all categorized in level iii of the fair value hierarchy 
as a result of our having to consolidate our nims vies  the fair value of derivative assets held by the nims vies and the nims vie debt are determined by using the same internally generated valuation model 
changes in expected principal credit losses on nims could impact our fair value estimate 
the gross expected principal credit losses were million and million as of december  and  respectively  and represent substantially all of our total nims rif 
our fair value estimate incorporates a discount rate that is based on our cds spread  which has resulted in a fair value amount that is million and million less than the expected principal credit losses at december  and  respectively 
changes in the credit loss estimates will impact the fair value directly  reduced only by the present value factor  which is dependent on the timing of the expected losses and our credit spread 
put options on cps and consolidated cps vie debt the fair value of our put options on cps and the cps vie debt  in the absence of observable market data  is estimated based on the present value of the spread differential between the current market rate of issuing a perpetual preferred security and the maximum contractual rate of our perpetual preferred security as specified in our put option agreements 
in determining the current market rate  consideration is given to any relevant market observations that are available 
we purchased substantially all of the securities issued by the three trusts  and we consolidated the assets and liabilities of those trusts during as of december   there is no consolidated cps vie debt because we had purchased all of the cps in the three trusts and  as such  the put options on cps are eliminated in consolidation as well 
vies effective january   we adopted the accounting standard update regarding improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with vies 
as a provider of credit enhancement  we have entered into insurance contracts with vies and derivative contracts with counterparties where we have provided credit protection directly on variable interests and  in some cases  obtained the contractual rights of our counterparties with respect to the vies 
as defined by the accounting standard  vies include corporations  trusts or partnerships in which equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance activities without additional subordinated financial support 
in addition  as a result of the update to the standard regarding accounting for transfers of financial assets  effective january   special purpose entities that were previously considered qualifying special purpose entities qspes are to be considered in the vie accounting framework as prescribed by the standard regarding financial reporting by enterprises involved with vies 
an entity is considered the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate a vie if its variable interest i gives it the power to most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie  and ii has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie 
for all vies in which we have a variable interest  we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary  a number of factors are considered  including the structure of the entity  provisions in our contracts that grant us additional rights to influence or control the economic performance of the vie upon the occurrence of an event of default or a servicer termination event or the breach of a performance trigger  and our obligation to absorb significant losses 
due to the continued deterioration of the performance of many of our financial guaranty transactions  the breach of these performance tests or other events giving rise to our right to influence or control the economic performance of the vie could occur 
when we obtain control rights  we perform an analysis to reassess our involvement with these vies to determine whether we have become the primary beneficiary 
when evaluating whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we determine which activities most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie 
as part of our qualitative analysis  we consider whether we have any contractual rights that would allow us to direct those activities 
as of december   we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of our nims transactions  our cps transactions and certain financial guaranty structured transactions  and we did not identify any new vies to be consolidated in our control rights in these vies  which we obtained due to an event of default or breach of a performance trigger as defined in the transaction  generally provide us with either a right to replace the vie servicer  or  in some cases  the right to direct the sale of the vie assets 
in those instances where we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary  we consolidate the assets and liabilities of the vie 
we have elected to carry the financial assets and financial liabilities of these vies at fair value 
for certain hybrid financial instruments that would be required to be separated into a host contract and a derivative instrument  the accounting standard regarding derivatives and hedging permits an entity to irrevocably elect to initially and subsequently measure that hybrid financial instrument in its entirety at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
we elected to record our convertible securities meeting these criteria at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as net gains or losses on investments 
all hybrid financial instruments are classified as trading securities 
investments we group assets in our investment portfolio into one of three main categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities 
fixed maturity securities for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are reported at amortized cost 
investments in securities not classified as held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses net of tax reported as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
investments classified as trading securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of income 
short term investments consist of assets invested in money market instruments  certificates of deposit and highly liquid  interest bearing instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase 
amortization of premium and accretion of discount are calculated principally using the interest method over the term of the investment 
realized gains and losses on investments are recognized using the specific identification method 
for certain hybrid financial instruments that would be required to be separated into a host contract and a derivative instrument  the accounting standard regarding derivatives and hedging permits an entity to irrevocably elect to initially and subsequently measure that hybrid financial instrument in its entirety at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
we elected to record our convertible securities meeting these criteria at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as net gains or losses on investments 
all hybrid financial instruments are classified as trading securities 
on april   we adopted a new accounting standard regarding recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairment otti 
in accordance with this new standard  we record an otti on a security if we intend to sell the impaired security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis  or if the present value of cash flows we expect to collect is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 
if a sale is likely  the security is classified as other than temporarily impaired and the full amount of the impairment is recognized as a loss in the statement of operations 
otherwise  losses on securities that are other than temporarily impaired are separated into i the portion of loss that represents the credit loss  and ii the portion that is due to other factors 
the credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in the statement of operations  while the loss due to other factors is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of taxes 
a credit loss is determined to exist if the present value of discounted cash flows expected to be collected from the security is less than the cost basis of the security 
the present value of discounted cash flows is determined using the original yield of the security 
for securities held as of april   that had previously been other than temporarily impaired  an after tax transition adjustment of million was booked to reclassify the non credit loss portion of these impairments from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consider several factors in addition to the above  including  but not limited to  the following the extent and the duration of the decline in value  the reasons for the decline in value eg  credit event  interest related or market fluctuations  and the financial position  access to capital and near term prospects of the issuer  including the current and future impact of any specific events 
income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of the accounting standard regarding accounting for income taxes 
as required under this standard  our deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized under the balance sheet method  which recognizes the future tax effect of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of these amounts 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled 
in  we were required to establish a valuation allowance against our dta as it was more likely than not that all or some portion of our dta would not be realized 
at each balance sheet date  we re assess our need for a valuation allowance and this assessment is based on all available evidence  both positive and negative  and requires management to exercise judgment and make assumptions regarding whether such dta will be realized in future periods 
future realization of our dta will ultimately depend on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character ordinary income versus capital gains within the applicable carryback and carryforward periods provided under the tax law 
the primary sources of negative evidence that we considered are our cumulative losses in recent years  and the continued uncertainty around our future operating results 
we also considered several sources of positive evidence when assessing the need for a valuation allowance such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future projections of taxable income  taxable income within the applicable carryback periods  and potential tax planning strategies 
in making our assessment of the more likely than not standard  the weight assigned to the effect of both negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which such evidence can be objectively verified 
in  in accordance with the accounting standard regarding the accounting and disclosure of income taxes in interim periods  we used an annualized effective tax rate to compute our tax expense each quarter 
we adjusted this annualized effective tax rate each quarter by the following discrete items i net gains or losses resulting from the change in fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments  ii investment gains or losses  iii the liabilities recorded under the accounting standard regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and iv prior year provision to filed tax return adjustments 
given the impact on our pre tax results of net gains or losses resulting from our derivative transactions and our investment portfolio  and the continued uncertainty around our ability to rely on short term financial projections  which directly affects our ability to estimate an effective tax rate for the full year of  we booked our income tax expense benefit in interim periods based on actual results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an update to the accounting standard regarding accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts 
this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and redefines acquisition costs as costs that are related directly to the successful acquisition of new  or the renewal of existing  insurance contracts 
previously  acquisition costs were defined as costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of insurance contracts 
the effect of this revised definition of acquisition costs will result in additional expenses being charged to earnings immediately  rather than being deferred 
there is no change to amortization requirements due to this update 
we have adopted this update on a prospective basis as of january  since we have discontinued writing any new financial guaranty business  there will be no impact to our financial guaranty segment from this update 
however  while we are currently still evaluating the impact this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures  we expect that the implementation of this new guidance will materially reduce the amount of policy acquisition costs that we defer associated with acquiring new mortgage insurance contracts  which totaled million and million in initial deferred costs for the years ended december  and  respectively  accelerating the recognition of certain expenses associated with these contracts 
the lower amount of deferred acquisition costs will also result in decreased amortization expense  which should partially offset the effect to our net income 
while the timing of when certain costs are reflected in our results of operations will change as a result of the adoption of this update  there will be no effect to the total acquisition costs to be recognized over time or to our cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued an update to the accounting standard regarding fair value measurements and disclosure 
this update changes the language used to describe the requirements in gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the amendments i clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements  and ii change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the amendments in this update do not require additional fair value measurements and are not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting 
this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued an update to the accounting standard regarding comprehensive income 
this update eliminates the current presentation options related to comprehensive income and provides an entity with the option to present the components of net income  other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income  either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
regardless of which option an entity chooses  the entity is required to present  on the face of the consolidated financial statements  reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s in which the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
in december  the fasb issued another update to the accounting standard regarding comprehensive income  which defers the effective date for the requirement noted above to present  on the face of the consolidated financial statements  the reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
we have adopted the accounting standard updates requiring additional disclosures regarding the reconciliation of level iii fair value measurements for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we have updated our disclosures to be consistent with the disclosure

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in market conditions 
examples of market risk include changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
we perform  on a quarterly basis  a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects of market risk exposures on our investment securities and certain financial guaranty contracts 
our sensitivity analysis for interest rates and credit spreads is generally calculated as a parallel shift in yield curve with all other factors remaining constant 
this analysis is performed by determining the potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
interest rate risk the primary market risk in our investment portfolio is interest rate risk  namely the fair value sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
we regularly analyze our exposure to interest rate risk and we have determined that the fair value of our interest rate sensitive investment assets is materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
we estimate the changes in fair value of our fixed income securities by projecting an instantaneous increase and decrease in interest rates 
the carrying value of our total investment portfolio at december  and was billion and billion  respectively  of which for both periods was invested in fixed income securities 
we calculate duration of our fixed income securities  expressed in years  in order to estimate interest rate sensitivity of these securities 
at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the market value of our fixed income securities by million  while a basis point decrease in interest rates would increase the market value of our fixed income securities by million 
at december   the average duration of the fixed income portfolio was years compared to years at december  credit risk we provide credit protection in the form of cdss and other financial guaranty contracts that are marked to market through earnings 
with the exception of nims  these financial guaranty derivative contracts generally insure obligations with considerable subordination beneath our exposure at the time of issuance 
the underlying asset classes of these obligations include corporate entities  abs  rmbs  cmbs  and trups 
with the exception of nims  one cdo of abs and our insured trups cdos all of which are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis  the value of our financial guaranty derivative contracts are affected predominantly by changes in credit spreads of the underlying obligations 
as credit spreads and ratings change  the value of these financial guaranty derivative contracts change and the resulting gains and losses are recorded in our operating results 
in addition  with the adoption of the accounting standard regarding fair value measurements  we have incorporated the market s perception of our non performance risk into the market value of our derivative instruments 
we have determined that the fair value of our cdss and other financial guaranty contracts is materially exposed to changes in credit spreads  including our own credit spread 
sensitivity to changes in credit spreads can be estimated by projecting a hypothetical instantaneous shift in credit spread curves 
the following tables present the pre tax change in the fair value of our insured derivatives portfolio and our vie debt as a result of instantaneous shifts in credit spreads as well as our own credit default spread as of december  these changes were calculated using the valuation methods described in critical accounting policies fair value of financial instruments above 
contracts for which the fair value is calculated using specific dealer quotes or actual transaction prices are excluded from the following tables 
radian group s five year cds spread was at december  radian group s five year cds spread is an illustration of the market s view of our non performance risk  the cds spread used in the valuation of specific derivatives is typically based on the remaining term of the instrument 
although the cds spreads reflect the market view of our non performance risk  this magnitude of widening should not be interpreted as a proportional increase in our non performance risk 
the non performance risk is commonly measured by default probability  which rises as the spread widens 
radian group s five year cds spread at december   implies a market view that there is an probability that radian group will default in the next five years  as compared to a implied probability of default at december  nims related in millions weighted average credit spread fair value of net liabilities increase decrease in fair value liability based on tightening of nims credit spreads change in nims credit spreads widening of nims credit spreads tightening of radian group s cds spread basis points change in radian group s cds spread widening of radian group s cds spread corporate cdos in millions weighted average credit spread fair value of net liabilities increase decrease in fair value liability based on tightening of cdo credit spreads change in cdo credit spreads widening of cdo credit spreads tightening of radian group s cds spread basis points change in radian group s cds spread widening of radian group s cds spread non corporate cdo related in millions weighted average credit spread fair value of net liabilities increase decrease in fair value liability based on tightening of cdo credit spreads change in cdo credit spreads widening of cdo credit spreads tightening of radian group s cds spread basis points change in radian group s cds spread widening of radian group s cds spread includes vie debt of million and nims derivative assets of million 
includes trups  cdos of cmbs  cdos of abs and other non corporate cdos 
includes net vie liabilities of million and net derivative liabilities of million 
given the relatively high level of volatility in spreads  including our own cds spread  for our derivative transactions and vie debt  the sensitivities presented above are higher than our longer term historical experience 
the range of a tightening and widening was determined based on our current cds spread and most recent experience 
foreign exchange rate risk we analyzed our currency exposure as of december   by identifying investments in our investment portfolio that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as part of our analysis  our investment portfolio foreign currency exposures were measured  generally assuming a decrease in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
with all other factors remaining constant  we estimated that such a decrease would reduce our investment portfolio held in foreign currencies by million as of december  at december   we held approximately million of investments denominated in euros 
the value of the euro against the us dollar weakened from at december   to at december  at december   we held approximately million of investments denominated in japanese yen 
the value of the yen against the us dollar strengthened from at december   to at december  equity market price at december   the market value and cost of the equity securities in our investment portfolio were million and million  respectively 
included in the market value and cost of our equity securities is million and million  respectively  classified as trading securities 
exposure to changes in equity market prices can be estimated by assessing potential changes in market values on our equity investments resulting from a hypothetical broad based decline in equity market prices of 
with all other factors remaining constant  we estimated that such a decrease would reduce our investment portfolio held in equity investments by million as of december
