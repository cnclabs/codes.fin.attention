item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations executive overview this section provides an overview of our financial results  recent product and late stage pipeline developments  and legal  regulatory  and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry 
financial results we achieved revenue growth of percent in  which was primarily driven by the collective growth of cymbalta  insulin products  animal health products  alimta  effient  and cialis  offset by the decline in gemzar and zyprexa revenue due to the loss of patent exclusivity 
this revenue growth  as well as a lower effective tax rate  was more than offset by lower gross margin percentage  increased marketing  selling  and administrative costs  higher other expense  and the increased impact in of the items noted below 
as a result  net income decreased percent to billion  and earnings per share decreased percent to per share  in as compared to billion  or per share  in us health care reform as a result of higher rebates and subsidies included in health care reform enacted in the us during  total revenue in was reduced by million pretax  or 
per share 
also  marketing  selling  and administrative expenses increased by million pretax  or 
per share  as a result of the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee 
collaborations note we incurred acquired in process research and development ipr d charges associated with the diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim of million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
asset impairments and related restructuring and other special charges note we recognized restructuring charges of million pretax  or 
per share  primarily related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions that we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce 
we incurred a charge of million pretax  or approximately 
per share  in primarily for returned product and contractual commitments related to the withdrawal of xigris 
us health care reform as a result of higher rebates included in health care reform enacted in the us during  total revenue in was reduced by million pretax  or 
per share 
we also recorded a one time non cash deferred income tax charge in the first quarter of million  or 
per share  associated with the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of our us retiree health plan 
acquisitions note we incurred acquired ipr d charges associated with the in licensing arrangement with acrux limited acrux of million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
asset impairments and related restructuring and other special charges note we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million pretax  or 
per share  primarily related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions 
late stage pipeline our long term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies 
we currently have approximately potential new drugs in human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical research 
there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development r d and the introduction of new products 
a high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development 
the process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take to years or longer and cost more than billion 
failure can occur at any point in the process  including late in the process after substantial investment 
as a result  most research programs will not generate financial returns 
new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns  inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  limited scope of approved uses  difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture  or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others 
delays and uncertainties in the us food and drug administration fda approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity 
consequently  it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved and the sales growth of those products 
we manage r d spending across our portfolio of molecules  and a delay in  or termination of  any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total r d spending 
due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the r d process  we cannot reliably estimate the nature  timing  completion dates  and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our r d projects  nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful r d project 
each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline  and none is individually material to our consolidated r d expense 
while we do accumulate certain r d costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes  we must make significant cost estimations and allocations  some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms 
therefore  we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total r d costs by project  by preclinical versus clinical spend  or by therapeutic category 
the following new molecular entities nmes are currently in phase iii clinical trial testing for potential use in the diseases described

tabalumab formerly baff mab q an anti baff monoclonal antibody for the treatment of lupus and rheumatoid arthritis biologic molecule subject to the us biologics price competition and innovation act the following nmes have been submitted for regulatory review for potential use in the disease described 
the quarter the nme initially was submitted for any indication is shown in parentheses florbetapir q a molecular imaging tool for the detection of beta amyloid plaque in the brain liprotamase q a non porcine pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency 
the following late stage pipeline developments have occurred since january  arxxant in december  we completed and evaluated the final clinical trial for arxxant  the eyes study  which did not meet the primary study endpoint 
we have opted not to re submit arxxant to the fda for diabetic retinopathy 
bydureon in june  the european commission granted marketing authorization for bydureon  the first once weekly treatment for type diabetes in combination with certain oral therapies 
european launches began in the third quarter of  starting with the united kingdom and germany 
in january  the fda approved bydureon as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type diabetes 
we and amylin terminated the collaboration in november  refer to note of the financial statements for additional information 
florbetapir in march  we received a complete response letter from the fda for the new drug application nda for amyvid florbetapir that was primarily focused on the need to establish a reader training program for market implementation that helps to ensure reader accuracy and consistency of interpretations of existing amyvid scans 
we submitted our response to the fda s complete response letter 
ixekizumab in november  we began the first phase iii clinical trial for ixekizumab 
linagliptin and empagliflozin in january  we announced a global agreement with boehringer ingelheim boehringer to jointly develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes compounds currently in mid and late stage development  including boehringer s two investigational oral diabetes agents  linagliptin and empagliflozin 
in  linagliptin was approved and launched in the us trade name tradjenta  japan trade name trazenta  europe trade name trajenta  and other countries 
in january  the fda approved jentadueto  a combination of linagliptin and metformin for the treatment of adults with type diabetes 
liprotamase in april  we received a complete response letter from the fda for the nda for liprotamase that communicated the need for us to conduct an additional clinical trial prior to a re submission 
we are currently finalizing the study design and anticipate starting a clinical study in necitumumab in february  we and bristol myers squibb company stopped enrollment in one of the two global phase iii studies 
the decision to stop enrollment in the phase iii non squamous nsclc inspire trial combination treatment with alimta followed an independent data monitoring committee recommendation that no new or recently enrolled patients continue treatment in the trial because of safety concerns related to thromboembolism blood clots in the experimental arm of the study 
the second phase iii study in squamous nsclc looking at the combination use of necitumumab with gemzar is continuing 
new insulin glargine product in september  we began the first phase iii clinical trial for our new insulin glargine product 
novel basal insulin analog in november  we began the first phase iii clinical trial for our novel basal insulin analog 
pomaglumetad methionil in february  we began the first phase iii clinical trial for pomaglumetad methionil 
solanezumab in january  an independent data monitoring committee dmc recommended that we continue the two ongoing phase iii randomized pivotal trials for solanezumab without modifications  based on pre planned interim safety and futility analyses 
the dmc also recommended that we make a protocol modification to expedition xt  the open label extension study of the two phase iii trials  making the protocol for the open label extension more consistent with the current protocol for the pivotal studies 
acquisition in february  we acquired chemgen corp  a privately held bioscience company specializing in the development and commercialization of innovative feed enzyme products that improve the efficiency of poultry  egg  and meat production 
the transaction is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
legal  regulatory  and other matters in october  we announced the withdrawal of our xigris 
drotrecogin alfa activated 
product in all markets following results of the prowess shock study  which did not meet the primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in day all cause mortality in patients with septic shock 
we incurred a charge of million pretax  or approximately 
per share  for product returns and contractual commitments related to xigris 
revenue related to xigris has not been material to our consolidated financial statements 
the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca and the health care and education reconciliation act of in march brought significant changes to us health care 
these changes began to affect our financial results in the first quarter of and will continue to have significant impact on our results in the future 
the us supreme court has agreed to decide the constitutionality of the ppaca 
oral arguments will take place in march and a decision is expected in the summer of changes to the rebates for prescription drugs sold to medicaid beneficiaries  which increase the minimum statutory rebate for branded drugs from percent to percent  became effective in the first quarter of this rebate has been expanded to managed medicaid  a program that provides for the delivery of medicaid benefits via managed care organizations  under arrangements between those organizations and state medicaid agencies 
additionally  a prescription drug discount program for outpatient drugs in certain types of health care facilities that serve low income and uninsured patients known as b facilities has been expanded 
beginning in  drug manufacturers provided a discount of percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the doughnut hole the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage 
the doughnut hole will be phased out by the federal government between and additionally  beginning in  a non tax deductible annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs 
this fee is allocated to companies based on their prior calendar year market share for branded prescription drug sales into these government programs 
in  we recorded million related to this fee  which is included in marketing  selling  and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
also  there are changes to the tax treatment of subsidies paid by the government to employers  such as us  who provide their retirees with a drug benefit at least equivalent to the medicare part d drug benefit 
beginning in  the federal government will tax the subsidy it provides to such employers 
while this tax will not take effect for two more years  accounting rules dictated that we adjust our deferred tax asset through a one time non cash charge of million upon enactment of the tax law change  which we recorded in the first quarter of the continuing prominence of us budget deficits as both a policy and political issue increases the risk that taxes  fees  rebates  or other measures that would further reduce pharmaceutical companies revenue or increase expenses may be enacted 
certain other federal and state health care proposals continue to be debated  and could place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices 
we also expect pricing pressures at state levels could become more severe 
these federal and state proposals  or state price pressures  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
the obama administration has proposed changes to the manner in which the us would tax the international income of us based companies 
there also have been tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the us congress that could change the manner in which  and the rate at which  income of us companies would be taxed 
while it is uncertain how the us congress may address us tax policy matters in the future  reform of us taxation  including taxation of international income  will continue to be a topic of discussion for congress and the obama administration 
a significant change to the us tax system  including changes to the taxation of international income  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
in october  puerto rico enacted income and excise tax legislation affecting our operations 
this tax is included in costs of sales in our consolidated statement of operations 
we believe this tax should be creditable against our us income taxes 
international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations  and several european countries have recently required either price decreases or rebate increases in response to economic pressures 
we also anticipate an adverse effect from biennial pricing actions in japan 
there are proposals for cost containment measures pending in a number of additional countries  including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls  limit access to or reimbursement for our products  or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 
such proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact  given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets as a result of austerity measures being pursued in a number of countries 
operating results revenue our worldwide revenue for increased percent  to billion  driven by the collective growth of cymbalta  insulin products  animal health products  alimta  effient  and cialis  offset by the decline in gemzar and zyprexa revenue due to the loss of patent exclusivity 
worldwide sales volume increased percent  and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates contributed percent of revenue growth  partially offset by a percent decrease due to lower prices 
the increase in volume and reduction in price were partially driven by the loss of us patent exclusivity for zyprexa and gemzar and the agreements to supply authorized versions of olanzapine and gemcitabine 
revenue in the us increased percent  to billion  due to higher volume  partially offset by lower prices 
revenue outside the us increased percent  to billion  due to increased demand and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates  partially offset by lower prices 
in  total revenue was reduced by million due to the impact of us health care reform 
the following table summarizes our revenue activity in compared with year ended december  year ended december  total percent change from product us outside us total dollars in millions zyprexa cymbalta alimta humalog cialis animal health products humulin evista forteo strattera gemzar other pharmaceutical products total net product sales collaboration and other revenue total revenue us revenue includes revenue in puerto rico 
numbers may not add due to rounding 
collaboration and other revenue is primarily composed of erbitux royalties and percent of byetta s gross margin in the us zyprexa is a treatment for schizophrenia  acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar i disorder  and bipolar maintenance 
zyprexa sales in the us decreased percent in due to the loss of patent exclusivity in the us on october  despite a decline in demand for branded zyprexa  us volume increased in primarily as a result of sales of authorized olanzapine in connection with our six month agreement with prasco laboratories 
this volume increase was more than offset by significant price reductions attributable both to branded zyprexa and authorized olanzapine 
sales outside the us decreased percent driven primarily by the loss of patent exclusivity throughout most major markets outside of japan during  partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand in japan 
in the five major european countries  which in the aggregate had approximately million in sales in  we lost exclusivity in spain in april and in france  germany  italy  and the united kingdom in september globally  upon loss of exclusivity  we are experiencing generic competition which is causing rapid and severe declines on our zyprexa sales 
in japan  our second largest market with approximately million in sales in  our patent expires in december we anticipate worldwide sales of zyprexa to decline by at least billion in sales of cymbalta  a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder  diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain  generalized anxiety disorder  and in the us for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia  increased percent in the us  driven primarily by increased demand and higher prices 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven primarily by increased demand and  to a lesser extent  the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
sales of alimta  a treatment for various cancers  increased percent in the us  due primarily to higher prices and increased demand 
sales outside the us increased percent  due to increased demand and  to a lesser extent  the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
we expect sales outside the us to be negatively affected by significant government price reductions in japan  which is our second largest market for alimta  and the introduction of generic competition in certain markets 
sales of humalog  our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes  increased percent in the us  due to increased demand and  to a lesser extent  higher prices 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven by increased demand and  to a lesser extent  the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
sales of cialis  a treatment for erectile dysfunction also approved in october for benign prostatic hyperplasia in the us  increased percent in the us  primarily due to higher prices 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven by increased demand  the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates  and higher prices 
sales of humulin  an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes  increased percent in the us  driven primarily by higher prices for humulin and increased demand attributable to humulin relion 
sales outside the us increased percent  due to increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates  partially offset by lower prices 
sales of evista  a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer  increased percent in the us  due to higher prices partially offset by lower demand 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and  to a lesser extent  increased demand  partially offset by lower prices 
sales of forteo  an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men  decreased percent in the us  driven by lower demand  partially offset by higher prices 
sales outside the us increased percent  primarily due to the increased demand in japan 
sales of strattera  a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children  adolescents  and in the us in adults  increased percent in the us  due primarily to higher prices  partially offset by lower demand 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven primarily by increased demand and  to a lesser extent  the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates  partially offset by lower prices 
sales of gemzar  a product approved to treat various cancers  decreased percent in the us  due to a rapid and severe decline in sales as a result of generic competition  which began in november  following the expiration of the compound patent 
sales outside the us decreased percent  due to generic competition in most major markets 
we expect sales to continue to decline in we report as revenue for erbitux  a product approved to treat various cancers  the net royalties received from our collaboration partners and our product sales 
our revenues increased percent to million in prior to the termination of our exenatide collaboration with amylin in november  we recognized in revenue our percent share of byetta s gross margin in the us in december  we recognized a pro rata portion of revenue resulting from the termination arrangement 
we will continue to recognize percent of byetta and bydureon sales outside the us until those markets transition to amylin on a market by market basis over a period beginning no earlier than the second half of and that will not extend beyond december  we also recognize our sales of byetta pen delivery devices to amylin which will continue until no later than the end of in  we recognized total exenatide revenue of million  a decrease of percent 
animal health product sales in the us increased percent  due primarily to increased demand 
sales outside the us increased percent during  driven primarily by the impact of the acquisition of certain janssen and pfizer animal health assets in europe and  to a lesser extent  increased demand for other products and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
gross margin  costs  and expenses gross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased by percentage points in to percent 
this decrease was due primarily to the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold  which significantly increased cost of sales in  but led to a modest reduction to cost of sales in patent expirations for zyprexa and gemzar also drove the reduction in gross margin percent 
marketing  selling  and administrative expenses increased percent in to billion 
the increase was driven by the diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim  as well as the effect of foreign exchange rates 
in addition  higher administrative expenses in the us included million related to the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with us health care reform 
investment in research and development increased percent  to billion  due primarily to increased late stage clinical trial costs  including costs related to the diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim 
we incurred an ipr d charge of million in  associated with our diabetes collaboration with boehringer ingelheim  compared with million in associated with the in licensing agreement with acrux 
we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million in  including charges of million primarily related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions that we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce  and a special charge of million related to the withdrawal of xigris 
in  we recognized charges totaling million for asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other net  expense increased million to a net expense of million in  due primarily to the partial impairment of the acquired ipr d assets related to liprotamase and amyvid in and damages recovered in from generic pharmaceutical companies related to zyprexa patent litigation in germany 
our effective tax rate was percent in  compared with percent in the decrease was due to the tax benefit on the ipr d charge associated with the boehringer ingelheim diabetes collaboration  as well as a benefit of million primarily from the resolution in of the irs audits of tax years  along with certain matters related to additionally  the tax rate for was increased by a one time charge of million associated with the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of our retiree health plan as part of us health care reform 
operating results financial results we achieved revenue growth of percent to billion in  which was primarily driven by the collective growth of alimta  cymbalta  animal health products  insulin products  cialis  and zyprexa  offset by a decline in gemzar revenue 
cost of sales and marketing  selling  and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue  while our investment in research and development grew at a greater rate than revenue and our effective tax rate increased 
net income increased percent to billion  and earnings per share increased percent to per share  in  as compared to billion  or per share  in net income comparisons between and are affected by the impact of several highlighted items 
the highlighted items for are summarized in the executive overview 
the highlighted items are summarized as follows acquisitions note we incurred acquired ipr d charges associated with an in licensing arrangement with incyte corporation incyte of million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
asset impairments and related restructuring and other special charges notes and we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by  for asset impairments and restructuring primarily related to the sale of our tippecanoe laboratories manufacturing site 
we incurred pretax charges of million in connection with the claims of several states related to zyprexa  which decreased earnings per share by

worldwide sales of byetta decreased percent to million during due to competitive pressures in the us and european markets 
our revenues decreased percent to million in erbitux revenues were million in  compared with million in animal health product sales in the us and outside the us increased percent  due primarily to increased demand for our companion animal and feed additive products 
gross margin  costs  and expenses gross margin as a percent of total revenue increased by percentage points in to percent 
this increase was due to lower manufacturing costs and higher selling prices  partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold 
marketing  selling  and administrative expenses increased percent in to billion 
the increase was driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside the us  partially offset by lower administrative and litigation expenses and company wide cost containment efforts 
investment in research and development increased percent  to billion  due primarily to charges related to pipeline molecules  including charges related to business development activities and termination of clinical trials 
we incurred an ipr d charge of million in  associated with the in licensing agreement with acrux  compared with million in resulting from the in licensing agreement with incyte 
we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million in  primarily related to severance and other related costs from previously announced strategic actions we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce 
in  we recognized charges totaling million for asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges 
see notes   and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other net  expense improved million to a net expense of million in  due primarily to net gains on equity investments  lower net interest expense  damages recovered from generic pharmaceutical companies following zyprexa patent litigation in germany  and an insurance recovery associated with the theft of product at our enfield  connecticut  distribution center 
the effective tax rate was percent for  compared with percent for the increase was driven by million in additional tax expense in the first quarter related to us health care reform 
the effective tax rate was reduced due to the tax benefit of asset impairment and restructuring charges associated with the sale of the tippecanoe laboratories manufacturing site 
financial condition as of december   cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled billion compared with billion at december  the increase in cash was driven by cash from operations of billion  partially offset by net noncurrent investment activity as cash was invested with maturities greater than one year of billion  dividends paid of billion  business and product acquisitions of billion  and purchases of property and equipment of million 
capital expenditures of million during were million less than in we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million as we invest in the long term growth of our diabetes care product portfolio and additional biotechnology capacity while continuing investments to improve the quality  productivity  and capability of our manufacturing  research  and development facilities 
total debt at december   was billion  an increase of million from december   which was due primarily to the million increase in the fair value of hedged debt offset by the full repayment in of million of short term floating rate debt and million in employee stock ownership plan debentures 
in  we plan to retire billion of our debt as it matures 
our current debt ratings from standard poor s and moody s remain aa and a  respectively 
our ratings outlook from both moody s and standard poor s is stable 
dividends of per share were paid in and was the th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments 
in the fourth quarter of  effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of  the quarterly dividend was maintained at 
per share  resulting in an indicated annual rate for of per share 
as of the fourth quarter of  the us economy continues to recover while concerns have grown regarding the health of the european economy 
worries in europe have spread beyond the peripheral nations to encompass the entirety of the euro area  with many economists believing a recession in the euro area to be probable 
meanwhile  us economic data in the fourth quarter generally exceeded expectations  with housing and employment indicators signaling a strengthening recovery 
still  given the fragility of the economic recovery and the heightened anxiety regarding europe  the federal reserve has maintained its view that accommodative policy is likely to be warranted through both domestically and abroad  high sovereign debt levels  sluggish growth  rating downgrades  and ongoing fiscal deficits have spurred efforts at fiscal austerity  notably in spain  italy  and greece 
we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment  the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers  including foreign government backed agencies and suppliers  the uncertain impact of recent health care legislation  the federal government s involvement in the us economy  and various international government funding levels 
currently  we believe economic conditions in europe will not have a material impact on our liquidity 
we believe that cash generated from operations  along with available cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs  including debt service  capital expenditures  and dividends in we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short term borrowings 
because of the high credit quality of our short and long term debt  our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected 
we currently have billion of unused committed bank credit facilities  billion of which backs our commercial paper program 
various risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in item a  risk factors  and the financial expectations for section  may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 
we depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenues  cash flows  and earnings 
through  we expect to lose us patent protection for cymbalta june and evista march 
cymbalta could receive an additional six months of exclusivity  based on completion of pediatric studies 
zyprexa and gemzar have already lost exclusivity in the us and europe 
in the us  gemzar lost exclusivity in november and zyprexa lost exclusivity in october in addition  we face us patent litigation over alimta  and it is possible we could lose our exclusivity prior to the expiration of the relevant patents 
refer to the hatch waxman patent litigation discussion in note and in the legal and regulatory matters section below 
the loss of exclusivity for alimta  cymbalta  or evista would likely result in generic competition  generally causing a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected product  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the us patent for humalog expires in may humalog is currently protected in europe only by formulation patents 
we do not currently expect the loss of patent protection for humalog to result in a rapid and severe decline in revenue 
to date  no company has received approval to market a biosimilar version of humalog  however  it is difficult to predict the likelihood and impact of biosimilars entering the market 
our goal is to mitigate the effect of these exclusivity losses on our operations  liquidity  and financial position through growth in our patent protected products that do not lose exclusivity during this period  in emerging markets  in japan  and in our animal health business 
our expected growth in the emerging markets and japan is attributable to both the growth of these markets and launches of new products in these markets 
in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values 
these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing  investing  and operating 
we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short term us dollar interest rates 
in an effort to manage interest rate exposures  we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance 
based on our overall interest rate exposure at december  and  including derivatives and other interest rate risk sensitive instruments  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december  and  respectively  would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen  and the british pound against the euro 
we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than the local currency 
we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates principally the euro  the british pound  and the japanese yen 
our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures 
gains and losses on these derivative positions offset  in part  the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets  liabilities  commitments  and anticipated revenues 
considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december  and  a hypothetical percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december  and  respectively  would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of foreign currency rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset  in part  by the results of the derivative instruments 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
we acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development 
milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg  approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels 
if required by the arrangement  we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained 
because of the contingent nature of these payments  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 
individually  these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period 
however  if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period  the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period 
these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product  which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments  however  we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives 
we also note that  from a business perspective  we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 
our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including interest payments capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet other total our long term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps 
we used the interest rate forward curve at december   to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps 
we have included the following purchase obligations  consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of december  some of these purchase orders may be cancelable  however  for purposes of this disclosure  we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations 
contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors  which are noncancelable and are not contingent 
we have included long term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities 
we excluded long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of billion  because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities 
this category consists of various miscellaneous items expected to be paid in the next year  none of which are individually material 
the contractual obligations table is current as of december  we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed  terminated  or modified 
application of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
for any given individual estimate or assumption we make  it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
we believe that  given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or liquidity for the periods presented in this report 
our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 
revenue recognition and sales return  rebate  and discount accruals we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
provisions for returns  rebates  and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us  primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products  or alternative approaches 
we attempt to maintain us wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio 
causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues  weather patterns  anticipated changes in the transportation network  redundant holiday stocking  and changes in wholesaler business operations 
in the us  the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers 
when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand  we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend  however  we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking 
wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns 
consistent with revenue recognition accounting guidance  when sales occur we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales 
this estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates 
we record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales 
once the product is returned  it is destroyed 
actual product returns have been less than one percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales 
we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales 
the rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales 
sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid  managed care  medicare  chargebacks  long term care  hospital  patient assistance programs  and various other government programs 
we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts 
the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends eg patent expiries  an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations  the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid recipients  and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts 
although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped  the medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later 
because of this time lag  in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 
most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales 
in some large european countries  government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country 
a best estimate of these rebates  updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits  is recognized in the same period as the related sale 
if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government  we adjust our rebate reserves 
we believe that our accruals for sales returns  rebates  and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
us sales returns  federally mandated medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs medicaid  and medicare rebates reduced sales by billion  billion  and billion in   and  respectively 
a percent change in the sales return  medicaid  and medicare rebate amounts we recognized in would lead to an approximate million effect on our income before income taxes 
as of december   our sales returns  medicaid  and medicare rebate liability was billion 
our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet 
our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
approximately percent and percent of our global sales return  rebate  and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the us as of december  and  respectively 
the following represents a roll forward of our most significant us returns  rebate  and discount liability balances  including medicaid in millions sales return  rebate  and discount liabilities  beginning of year reduction of net sales due to sales returns  discounts  and rebates cash payments of discounts and rebates sales return  rebate  and discount liabilities  end of year adjustments of the estimates for these returns  rebates  and discounts to actual results were less than percent of net sales for each of the years presented 
product litigation liabilities and other contingencies product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are  by their nature  uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities 
the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation  the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases  the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation  and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions  if any 
in addition  we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred  but not filed  to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs 
we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage 
we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable 
we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance 
in assessing our insurance coverage  we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions  the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company  the financial condition of the insurers  and the possibility of and length of time for collection 
due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance  we have been and will continue to be largely self insured for future product liability losses for substantially all our currently marketed products 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims 
the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets 
pension and retiree medical plan assumptions pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate  retirement age  and expected return on plan assets 
retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate  retirement age  expected return on plan assets  and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
in addition to the analysis below  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 
annually  we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans 
in evaluating these assumptions  we consider many factors  including an evaluation of the discount rates  expected return on plan assets  and health care cost trend rates of other companies  our historical assumptions compared with actual results  an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations approximately percent of which are growth investments  and the views of leading financial advisers and economists 
we use an actuarially determined  company specific yield curve to determine the discount rate 
in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption  we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 
if the health care cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year  the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the annual expense would increase by million 
a one percentage point decrease would decrease the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost by million 
if the discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point  income before income taxes would change by million 
if the expected return on plan assets for us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point  income before income taxes would change by million 
if our assumption regarding the expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year  our income before income taxes would be affected by million 
the us plans  including puerto rico  represent approximately percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately percent of total plan assets at december  impairment of indefinite lived and long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value 
if an impairment is identified  a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset s net book value over its fair value  and the cost basis is adjusted 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present 
when required  a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 
there are several methods that can be used to determine the estimated fair value of the ipr d acquired in a business combination  all of which require multiple assumptions 
we utilize the income method  which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization  to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs 
these projections are based on factors such as relevant market size  patent protection  historical pricing of similar products  and expected industry trends 
the estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate 
this analysis is performed for each project independently 
for ipr d assets  the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product  as discussed previously in the late stage pipeline section 
the nature of the pharmaceutical business is high risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products 
as such  it is likely that some ipr d assets will become impaired at some time in the future 
the estimated future cash flows  based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s judgment 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
income taxes we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities  which may result in future tax  interest  and penalty assessments by these authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation  and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances 
for example  adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities  new information obtained during a tax examination  or resolution of an examination 
we believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns 
we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets  primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions 
in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets  we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption 
implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 
a percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of million and million  respectively 
financial expectations for for the full year of  we expect earnings per share to be in the range of to 
we anticipate that total revenue will be between billion and billion 
this includes an expected decline of more than billion in zyprexa sales due to patent expirations in most markets outside of japan 
the reduction in revenue due to zyprexa patent expirations is expected to be partially offset by growth in key franchises including cymbalta  cialis  humalog  humulin  and forteo  as well as continued growth of newer products such as effient  axiron  and tradjenta 
we also anticipate continued strong  double digit revenue growth from our elanco animal health business 
both japan and emerging markets are expected to post continued strong underlying volume growth  however  overall revenue growth in these markets in will be adversely affected by anticipated pricing actions in japan and by the expected impact of patent expirations  including zyprexa  in some emerging market countries 
we anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately percent 
marketing  selling  and administrative expenses are expected to decline and be in the range of billion to billion 
research and development expense is expected to be flat to increasing and in the range of billion to billion 
other net  expense is expected to be in a range between net expense of million and net income of million 
operating cash flows are expected to be more than sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately million  as well as anticipated business development activity and our current dividend 
private securities litigation reform act of a caution concerning forward looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we caution investors that any forward looking statements or projections made by us  including those above  are based on management s belief at the time they are made 
however  they are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially and will depend on  among other things  the continuing growth of our currently marketed products  developments with competitive products  the implementation of us health care reform  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches  asset impairments  restructurings  and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired ipr d charges  foreign exchange rates and global macroeconomic conditions  changes in effective tax rates  wholesaler inventory changes  other regulatory developments  litigation  patent disputes  and government investigations  the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing  importation  and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals  and other factors that may affect our operations and prospects  which are discussed earlier in this section and in item a  risk factors 
we undertake no duty to update these forward looking statements 
legal and regulatory matters we are a party to various legal actions and government investigations 
the most significant of these are described below 
it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters  and we cannot reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued for any of these matters  however  we believe that  except as specifically noted below with respect to the alimta hatch waxman act patent challenges  the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity  but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period 
patent litigation we are engaged in the following us patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the hatch waxman act the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of alimta teva parenteral medicines  inc teva  app pharmaceuticals  llc app  and barr laboratories  inc barr each submitted andas seeking approval to market generic versions of alimta prior to the expiration of the relevant us patents and data based pediatric exclusivity period compound patent licensed from the trustees of princeton university and expiring in  concomitant nutritional supplement use patent expiring in and alleging the patents are invalid 
we  along with princeton  filed lawsuits in the us district court for the district of delaware against teva  app  and barr seeking rulings that the compound patent is valid and infringed 
in july  the district court entered judgment in our favor  upholding that patent s validity 
the generic manufacturers have appealed this decision 
in october  we filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the southern district of indiana against teva  app  pliva hrvatska doo  and barr seeking rulings that our concomitant nutritional supplement use patent is valid and infringed 
no trial date has yet been set 
in january  we filed a similar lawsuit against accord healthcare inc we believe the hatch waxman challenges to alimta are without merit and expect to prevail in this litigation 
however  it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation  and accordingly  we can provide no assurance that we will prevail 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
we expect a loss of exclusivity for alimta would result in a rapid and severe decline in future revenues in the relevant market 
strattera actavis elizabeth llc actavis  apotex inc apotex  aurobindo pharma ltd 
aurobindo  mylan pharmaceuticals inc mylan  sandoz inc sandoz  sun pharmaceutical industries limited sun ltd  and teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc teva usa each submitted an anda seeking permission to market generic versions of strattera prior to the expiration of our relevant us patent and data based pediatric exclusivity period expiring in  and alleging that this patent is invalid 
in  we brought a lawsuit against actavis  apotex  aurobindo  mylan  sandoz  sun ltd  and teva usa in the us district court for the district of new jersey 
in august  the court ruled that our patent was invalid  however  in july  the court of appeals for the federal circuit overturned that decision  upholding the patent 
the federal circuit court of appeals denied the generic manufacturers petition for rehearing en banc in october  and the deadline for any further appeal has passed 
zydus pharmaceuticals zydus filed an action in the new jersey district court in october seeking a declaratory judgment that it has the right to launch a generic atomoxetine product  based on the district court ruling 
we believe that zydus is subject to the injunction issued by the court of appeals in the actavis case 
zyprexa litigation we are a defendant in approximately zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the us covering approximately plaintiffs 
the lawsuits allege a variety of injuries from the use of zyprexa  with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels 
the claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of zyprexa 
many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug 
approximately of the lawsuits  covering about plaintiffs  are part of a multi district litigation mdl proceeding before the honorable jack weinstein in the federal district court for the eastern district of new york edny mdl no 

in october  a jury trial in a california state court was decided in our favor 
we are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of zyprexa in all these lawsuits and claims 
we were served with lawsuits filed by states alleging that zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels  and that we improperly promoted the drug 
we settled the zyprexa related claims of all of these states  incurring pretax charges of million in and million in in and  four lawsuits were filed in the edny purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third party payors  excluding governmental entities  which made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed zyprexa 
these actions were consolidated into a single lawsuit  brought under certain state consumer protection statutes  the federal civil racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act  and common law theories  seeking a refund of the cost of zyprexa  treble damages  punitive damages  and attorneys fees 
as with the product liability suits  these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug 
in september  judge weinstein certified a class consisting of third party payors  excluding governmental entities and individual consumers  and denied our motion for summary judgment 
in september  both decisions were reversed by the second circuit court of appeals  which found that the case cannot proceed as a class action and entered a judgment in our favor on plaintiffs overpricing claim 
the us supreme court denied plaintiffs petition for certiorari 
all remaining claims at issue in these cases have now been resolved 
byetta litigation we have been named as a defendant in approximately lawsuits involving approximately plaintiffs  primarily seeking to recover damages for pancreatitis experienced by patients prescribed byetta 
we are aware of approximately additional claimants who have not yet filed suit 
approximately of these lawsuits are filed in california and coordinated in a los angeles superior court 
other product liability litigation we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol 
these claims are covered by insurance  subject to deductibles and coverage limits 
product liability insurance because of the nature of pharmaceutical products  it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future 
in the past several years  we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market 
therefore  for substantially all of our currently marketed products  we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self insured for future product liability losses 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future
