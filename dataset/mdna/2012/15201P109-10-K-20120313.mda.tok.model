executive summary organizational structure our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of centerstate banks  inc the parent company  company  corporate  centerstate or csfl  and our two wholly owned subsidiary banks csb and vsb and our non bank subsidiary rall  inc rall 
in december we merged our three national chartered banks together  combining central and csbna with csb as the surviving bank 
on january  we merged centerstate shared services csss  a wholly owned subsidiary of our previous four subsidiary banks  into csb 
csss provided item processing services and information technology services to all of our subsidiary banks 
after it was merged into csb  it continues performing these same services as a department within csb 
at the holding company  or parent company  level  we perform functions that include strategic planning  merger and acquisition functions  investor relations  capital management  financial reporting  income tax management and reporting  loan review  internal audit  risk assessment and monitoring  and generally oversee and monitor the activities of our subsidiary banks 
all of the operating activities associated with and related to the commercial banking business is performed and managed at the subsidiary bank level 
in we formed a separate non bank subsidiary  rall  for the purpose of acquisition and disposition of troubled assets from our subsidiary banks

most of our loans are secured by real estate located in central florida 

table of contents our profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from interest earning assets ie loans and investments less the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities ie customer deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned and paid on these balances 
net interest income is dependent upon the interest rate spread which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates  deposit flows  and loan demand 
additionally  our profitability is affected by such factors as the level of non interest income and expenses  the provision for credit losses  and the effective tax rate 
non interest income consists primarily of service fees on deposit accounts and related services  and also includes commissions earned on bond sales  brokering single family home loans  sale of mutual funds  annuities and other non traditional and non insured investments 
non interest expense consists of compensation  employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  and other operating expenses 
at december   our two subsidiary banks operated through bank branch locations in seventeen counties in florida as summarized in the table below subsidiary banks no

lucie  volusia valrico state bank vsb hillsborough correspondent banking division we also operate a correspondent banking and bond sales division 
the division is integrated with and part of our lead subsidiary bank  csb  located in winter haven  florida  although the majority of our bond salesmen  traders and operations personnel are physically housed in leased facilities located in birmingham  alabama and atlanta  georgia 
the business lines of this division are primarily divided into three inter related revenue generating activities 
the first  and largest  revenue generator is commissions earned on fixed income security sales 
the second category includes a correspondent bank deposits ie  federal funds purchased and b correspondent bank checking accounts 
the third  and smallest revenue generating category  includes fees from safe keeping activities  bond accounting services for correspondents  asset liability consulting related activities  and beginning in correspondent clearing account services 
the customer base includes small to medium size financial institutions primarily located in florida  alabama  georgia  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  virginia and west virginia 
fdic assisted acquisitions and other branching activities during we acquired three failed financial institutions through fdic assisted transactions 
these acquisitions included approximately million of deposits and loans with a fair value as of the acquisition date of approximately million 
substantially all the loans have loss share agreements beginning with the first dollar of loss 
in total  these three acquisitions included nine branch locations  all within or contiguous with our current geographical market footprint 
also during  we hired a seasoned and experienced management team in the vero beach  florida area  and opened a new branch around this team 
similarly  we also hired another seasoned and experienced management team in the okeechobee  florida area  and opened a new branch around this team as well 
in january we closed on a previously announced transaction with td bank  na whereby we acquired four branches in putnam county  florida 
total deposits acquired approximated million for which we did 
table of contents not pay a premium 
in addition  we selected and purchased approximately million of performing loans located within our county market area in central florida 
we purchased the loans for of the legal unpaid principal balance and have an option during the initial two year period to put back any loan that becomes past due greater than days or becomes adversely classified pursuant to banking regulation guidelines 
we recognized an million dollar bargain purchase gain during the first quarter of as a result of this transaction 
on november  we acquired federal trust corporation ftc and its wholly owned subsidiary thrift  federal trust bank ftb from the hartford insurance group  inc hartford  the sole owner of ftc 
we assumed all of the deposits approximately million and certain selected other liabilities  including a million trust preferred security issued by ftc 
we acquired only selected performing loans and five of their existing branches 
ftb closed the other six branches immediately prior to our acquisition 
the purchased loans had a fair value at the acquisition date of approximately million 
we purchased the loans for of their legal unpaid principal balance  which was the primary reason for the million bargain purchase gain after merger related expenses recognized in our fourth quarter of in addition to the loan discount  we have an option to put back any loan that becomes days past due or becomes adversely classified pursuant to banking regulation guidelines to hartford  for a period of one year beginning with the acquisition date 
also during  we hired a seasoned and experienced prior jacksonville  florida bank ceo  mr 
gil pomar 
since hired  he had been working out of a loan production office in jacksonville  with a small team of two lenders and an administrative assistant 
during january of we acquired a failed financial institution in jacksonville with offices 
this is our sixth and largest fdic assisted transaction 
mr 
pomar will manage this acquisition and use it to leverage and build our market presence in jacksonville 
on january  we acquired the banking operations of central florida state bank in belleview  florida near ocala central fl through an fdic assisted transaction of a failed bank 
we acquired approximately million of loans  before loan discounts and fdic receivables with loss share protection from the fdic 
central fl had four branches  all of which are within two miles of an existing centerstate branch 
we expect to combine these branches in the near future 
the transaction is expected to be neutral to tangible book value and accrete about to per share to annualized earnings  once the branches are combined 
the addition of the central fl acquisition expands and enhances our presence in the greater ocala  florida market area  building on our acquisition of ocala national bank and acquisition of independent national bank  ocala  both of which were also fdic assisted transactions 
capital offering during the third quarter of we raised additional capital through another public stock offering 
we sold a total of  common shares at per share 
after investment banking fees and other expenses  the net increase to our common equity was approximately million 
this capital raise along with the previous raise in were both used to support our growth from the acquisitions discussed above  as well as a buffer against losses and potential losses in our loan portfolio resulting from the significant downturn in the florida real estate market 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
accounting policies are described in detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 

table of contents allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on our assessment of several factors reviews and evaluation of individual loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry concentrations  historical loan loss experiences and the level of classified and nonperforming loans 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
a standardized loan grading system is utilized at each of our subsidiary banks 
the grading system is integral to our risk assessment function related to lending 
loan officers of each bank assign a loan grade to their newly originated loans in accordance with the standard loan grades 
throughout the lending relationship  the loan officer is responsible for periodic reviews  and if warranted he she will downgrade or upgrade a particular loan based on specific events and or analyses 
we use a loan grading system of through grade is excellent and grade is doubtful 
loans graded or higher are placed on a watch list each month end and reported to that particular bank s board of directors 
our loan review officer  who is independent of the lending function and is not an employee of any subsidiary bank  periodically reviews each bank s loan portfolio and lending relationships 
the officer may disagree with a particular bank s grade on a particular loan and subsequently downgrade or upgrade such loan s based on his risk analysis 
as such  our lending process is decentralized  but our credit review process is centralized 
beginning in late  our ceo initiated a new program referred to as centercourt  whereby all of our bank presidents and our chief lending officers are gathered together in one room along with our ceo  cfo  coo and chief loan review officer 
each bank president and chief lending officer presents their prepared written report on the status of their bank s loan portfolio 
past due  non accrual  impaired  potentially impaired  and loans in process of foreclosure  as well as oreo issues are presented and discussed 
these meetings are generally held once per quarter 
the objectives include early and quick identification and resolutions of potential loan losses  as well as sharing information and ideas between banks 
the process also contributes to each bank s allowance for loan loss analysis assumptions and preparation 
beginning in early  with the december merger of our three national chartered banks as one of the catalysts  these meetings evolved into monthly meetings with a standardized report prepared by our chief credit officer cco  our chief special asset manager cspa and their teams 
they now have the responsibility of identifying and reporting all impaired loans  non accrual loans  tdrs  and oreo 
they make sure that all non performing loans  subject to asc  as well as oreo properties have a current appraisal less than one year old and that the asset is written down to of the current appraisal  or less under certain circumstances  such as a listing price in the case of oreo  or a time value adjustment in the case of loans with appraisals approaching their one year life  and the related collateral is either in a type of category or in a market area with declining values 
when these monthly meetings start  these teams have already evaluated their positions and have identified the course of action on each of the troubled assets listed 
our ceo and the ceo of our lead subsidiary bank  review these evaluations with our cco and cspa  and either approve or modify their recommendations 
we also have one of our senior accounting officers present  who along with our cco is ultimately responsible for preparing the company s allowance for loan loss calculations each quarter 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance consists of three components 
the first component consists of amounts specifically reserved specific allowance for specific loans identified as impaired  as defined by fasb accounting standards codification no 
asc 
impaired loans are those loans that management has estimated will not repay as agreed upon 
each of these loans is required to have a written analysis supporting the amount of specific reserve allocated to the particular loan  if any 
that is to say  a loan may be impaired ie not expected to repay as agreed  but may be sufficiently collateralized such that we expect to recover all principal and interest eventually  and therefore no specific reserve is warranted 

table of contents the second component is a general reserve general allowance on all of the company s loans other than those identified as impaired 
we group these loans into categories with similar characteristics and then apply a loss factor to each group which is derived from our historical loss factor for that category adjusted for current internal and external environmental factors  as well as for certain loan grading factors 
the third component consists of amounts reserved for purchased credit impaired loans 
on a quarterly basis  the company updates the amount of loan principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected  incorporating assumptions regarding default rates  loss severities  the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions 
probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows trigger the recognition of impairment  which is then measured as the present value of the expected principal loss plus any related foregone interest cash flows discounted at the pool s effective interest rate 
impairments that occur after the acquisition date are recognized through the provision for loan losses 
probable and significant increases in expected principal cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses  any remaining increases are recognized prospectively as interest income 
the impacts of i prepayments  ii changes in variable interest rates  and iii any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows are recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income 
disposals of loans  which may include sales of loans  receipt of payments in full by the borrower  or foreclosure  result in removal of the loan from the purchased credit impaired portfolio 
the aggregate of these three components results in our total allowance for loan losses 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to january  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill resulting from business combinations after january   is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred  plus the fair value of any non controlling interests in the acquiree  over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but tested for impairment at least annually 
the company has selected november as the date to perform the annual impairment test 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values 
goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheet 
we have a million goodwill asset on our consolidated balance sheet at december  other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible assets arising from whole bank and branch acquisitions 
they are initially measure at the fair value and then amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives  generally years 
goodwill and intangible assets are described further in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we determine our income tax expense based on management s judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes 
these permanent differences result in an effective tax rate  which differs from the federal statutory rate 
in addition  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities  recorded in the consolidated statements of financial condition  based on management s judgment and estimates regarding timing differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes 
we must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is not more likely than not 
in making this assessment  management must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years  the future reversal of existing 
table of contents taxable temporary differences  future taxable income  and the possible application of future tax planning strategies 
management believes that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets included in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition will be fully realized  although there is no guarantee that those assets will be recognizable in future periods 
we have a net deferred tax asset of million in our consolidated balance sheet at december  for additional discussion of income taxes  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
purchased credit impaired loans we account for acquisitions under the purchase accounting method 
all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value 
we review each loan or loan pool acquired to determine whether there is evidence of a deterioration in credit quality since inception and if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual loan agreements 
we consider expected prepayments and estimated cash flows including principal and interest payments at the date of acquisition 
the amount in excess of the estimated future cash flows is not accreted into earnings 
the amount in excess of the estimated future cash flows over the book value of the loan is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan accretable yield 
the company records these loans on the acquisition date at their net realizable value 
thus  an allowance for estimated future losses is not established on the acquisition date 
we refine our estimates of the fair value of loans acquired for up to one year from the date of acquisition 
subsequent to the date of acquisition  we update the expected future cash flows on loans acquired on a quarterly basis 
losses or a reduction in cash flow which arise subsequent to the date of acquisition are reflected as a charge through the provision for loan losses 
an increase in the expected cash flows adjusts the level of the accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the remaining life of the loan 
fdic loss share receivable we have entered into agreements with the fdic for reimbursement of losses within acquired loan portfolios 
the fdic loss share receivable is recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition based upon the expected reimbursements to be received from the fdic adjusted by a discount rate which reflects counter party credit risk and other uncertainties 
changes in the underlying credit quality of the loans covered by the fdic loss share receivable result in either an increase or a decrease in the fdic loss share receivable 
deterioration in loan credit quality increases the fdic loss share receivable  increases in credit quality decrease the fdic loss share receivable 
proceeds received for reimbursement of incurred losses reduce the fdic loss share receivable 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  net income our net income for the year ended december  was  or per share basic and diluted  compared to net loss of  or per share basic and diluted for the year ended december  the primary reason for the profitable year in was bargain purchase gains of  from our january acquisition of loans  deposits and branch offices from td bank  na and our november acquisition of federal trust bank from the hartford insurance group  inc the other significant issue affecting our earnings continues to be credit cost

net interest income margin net interest income consists of interest income generated by earning assets  less interest expense

averages balances are average daily balances 
covered loans are loans purchased from the fdic pursuant to assisted acquisitions of failed financial institutions  and are covered with respect to certain loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
non accrual loans a loan is moved to nonaccrual status in accordance with the company s policy typically after days of non payment  or less than days of non payment if management determines that the full timely collection of principal and interest becomes doubtful 
past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan 
in all cases  loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful 
nonaccrual loans and loans past due days still on accrual include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified impaired loans 
all interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual  is reversed against interest income 
interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method  until qualifying for return to accrual 
loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses expense increased  to  during the year ending december  compared to  for the comparable period in starting in  the company took a liquidation approach to its problem assets 
troubled loans with unpaid legal balances and carrying balances of approximately  and  respectively  were sold for  during the third quarter of the portion of the provision for loan losses that represented the liquidation discount from this sale was approximately  prior to this sale  the loans had been written down to fair value and the provision for loan losses increased accordingly 
during the fourth quarter of  troubled loans with unpaid legal balances and carrying balances of approximately  and  respectively  were sold for  the company recorded approximately  of additional provision for loan losses representing the liquidation discounts as a result of this loan sale 
our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is a charge to current period earnings  and is decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries on prior loan charge offs 
therefore  the provision for loan losses income statement effect is a residual of management s determination of allowance for loan losses balance sheet approach 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we consider those levels maintained by conditions of individual borrowers  the historical loan loss experience  the general economic environment  the overall portfolio composition  and other information 
as these factors change  the level of loan loss provision changes 
see credit quality and allowance for loan losses regarding the allowance for loan losses for additional information 
non interest income non interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the comparable period in this increase was the result of the following components listed in the table below increase decrease increase decrease service charges on deposit accounts income from correspondent banking and bond sales division correspondent banking division other fees commissions from sale of mutual funds and annuities debit card and atm fees loan related fees boli income trading securities revenue fdic indemnification asset accretion amortization of discount rate fdic indemnification income   n a other service charges and fees gain on sale of securities subtotal bargain purchase gain from acquisitions total non interest income as shown in the table above  the primary reasons for the increase in non interest income year to year was the bargain purchase gain from the january purchase from td bank  na and the november 
table of contents purchase from hartford 
in both cases  selected performing loans were purchased at a discount with regard to td bank  na transaction and a discount with regard to the hartford transaction  which was the primary reason for the bargain purchase gains 
the correspondent banking bond sales division had an outstanding year in most of which can be attributed to a record third quarter 
we expect significant volatility in the fixed income business  and therefore do not consider their initial three year performance necessarily a trend 
the fdic indemnification asset ia discount amortization is producing negative amortization due to adjustments in the fdic covered loan portfolio 
that is  to the extent current adjusted projected losses in the covered loan portfolio are less than originally projected losses  and therefore future loan accretion yields increase  the related projected reimbursements from the fdic contemplated in the ia is less  which produces a negative income accretion in non interest income 
this event corresponds to the increase in yields in the fdic covered loan portfolio 
when a fdic covered oreo property is sold at a loss  the loss is included in non interest expense as loss on sale of oreo  and eighty percent of the loss is recorded as fdic indemnification income and included in non interest income 
eighty percent of any related loan pool impairments also are reflected in this account 
we sell securities available for sale from time to time pursuant to our asset liability management process 
we manage our balance sheet with the objectives of lowering our overall cost of deposits and freeing up additional capital 
we do not know if we will sell additional securities available for sale  or to the extent of any potential sales 
we do not know what future interest rates will be and therefore uncertain as what potential gains  if any  could be expected

the data processing termination fee and severance payments were paid by hartford to centerstate  and as such were in the bargain purchase gain and shown in non interest expense

excluding merger  acquisition and conversion related expense  and excluding credit cost and our correspondent division  the remaining non interest expense approximates the operating expense of our core commercial and consumer banking segment 
as shown in the table above  this expense increased approximately  or year to year 
the reasons for this increase include the following during july and august of we acquired three failed financial institutions which included nine branches in the aggregate 
we incurred the related incremental expenses for approximately five months during versus the entire year for each of these three banks operated on three different core processing systems  which we were not able to convert to our core processing system until june  july and august of  adding elevated cost in terms of data processing  personnel and other temporary inefficiencies above the normalized incremental operating expenses 
in january we acquired four bank branch offices  approximately million of loans and assumed approximately million of deposits from td bank  na the related operating expenses associated with this business acquisition were included in our non interest expense  but not in on november  we acquired five bank branch offices  approximately million of loans and assumed approximately million of deposits from hartford 
the related operating expenses associated with this business acquisition were not included in our non interest expense

the reason our effective tax rate is higher than our statutory tax rate in is because we had substantial tax exempt income in excess of non deductible expenses thereby increasing our taxable loss substantially above our book loss as recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
the table below demonstrates this difference

although our overall credit cost was higher in versus  our net loss was lower  due to a variety of other factors including higher commissions earned on correspondent banking bond sales  higher gain on sale of securities available for sale  a bargain purchase gain from one of our fdic assisted transactions  and earnings growth from the acquisitions during the year 
these and other factors contributing to our results are discussed below 
net interest income margin net interest income consists of interest income generated by earning assets  less interest expense 
net interest income increased  or to  during the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the increase was the result of a increase in interest income plus a  decrease in interest expense

averages balances are average daily balances 
covered loans are loans purchased from the fdic pursuant to assisted acquisitions of failed financial institutions  and are covered with respect to certain loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
non accrual loans a loan is moved to nonaccrual status in accordance with the company s policy typically after days of non payment  or less than days of non payment if management determines that the full timely collection of principal and interest becomes doubtful 
past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan 
in all cases  loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful 
nonaccrual loans and loans past due days still on accrual include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified impaired loans 
all interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual  is reversed against interest income 
interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method  until qualifying for return to accrual 
loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses expense increased  to  during the year ending december  compared to  for the comparable period in our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is a charge to current period earnings  and is decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries on prior loan charge offs 
therefore  the provision for loan losses income statement effect is a residual of management s determination of allowance for loan losses balance sheet approach 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we consider those levels maintained by conditions of individual borrowers  the historical loan loss experience  the general economic environment  the overall portfolio composition  and other information 
as these factors change  the level of loan loss provision changes 
see credit quality and allowance for loan losses regarding the allowance for loan losses for additional information 
non interest income non interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the comparable period in this increase was the result of the following components listed in the table below 
increase decrease increase decrease service charges on deposit accounts income from correspondent banking and bond sales division correspondent banking division other fees commissions from sale of mutual funds and annuities debit card and atm fees loan related fees boli income trading securities revenue fdic indemnification asset accretion of discount rate n a other service charges and fees gain on sale of securities subtotal bargain purchase gain  acquisition of failed institution   n a total non interest income as shown in the table above  the primary reasons for the increase in non interest income year to year was the significant revenue growth in the correspondent banking division  the increased gain on sale of securities available for sale  the bargain purchase gain from one of the fdic assisted acquisitions  and the overall growth in fee revenue due to the business growth from the three fdic assisted acquisitions 
the correspondent banking bond sales division had an outstanding year most of which can be attributed to a record third quarter 
we expected significant volatility in the fixed income business  and therefore do not consider their initial three year performance necessarily a trend 
we sold a significant amount of securities available for sale during the current year pursuant to our asset liability management process

our largest non interest expense is employee and employee related expenses 
total salaries  wages and employee benefits for accounted for of our total non interest expense  and for referring to the table above  employee salaries and wages increased by  or to  for  compared to  for the increase was primarily due to the increase in variable compensation at our correspondent banking division 
the majority of employee salaries and wage expense from the correspondent banking division is related to commissions on bond sales  which is all variable based 
the expense for was approximately  compared to  for  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily  but not completely  related to the increase in sales 
gross commissions from sales of fixed income securities was approximately  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
excluding the correspondent banking division  discussed above  total salaries and wage expense was approximately  for compared to  for  an increase of 
this increase was due to the increase in full time equivalent employees ftes  excluding the correspondent banking division 
at the end of we had approximately ftes  however  since most of these employees were added mid year  the average ftes for is approximately in addition  our average cost per fte  excluding the correspondent division  increased from in to in because many of the additional hires discussed above are managerial levels  and has added some upward pressure to our averages

year year year employee salary and wages remove correspondent banking division salary and wages employee salary and wages  excluding correspondent banking division total average ftes remove correspondent banking division average ftes average ftes excluding correspondent banking division cost per average fte  excluding correspondent banking division we use a combination of performance incentive bonus guidelines to motivate our employees and influence behavior 
these are primarily tied to earnings performance and growth metrics at each business unit 
as our net 
table of contents income increases and our assets grow  our employee incentive bonus compensation also increases 
in addition  we also have incentive compensation programs tied to growth of core deposits for certain employee classes responsible for these types of deposit customer relationships 
although we reported a net loss for on a consolidated basis  two of our banks were profitable 
in addition  our performance guidelines reward balance sheet growth as well  up to certain levels 
as a result  several business units qualified for an incentive award 
approximately of the  employee incentive bonus compensation recognized during relates to our largest subsidiary bank  csb  excluding the employees from the other two national chartered banks that were merged into it during december the remaining was dispersed among most of the remaining business units and several of the senior corporate officers 
during our occupancy expense increased by  or and our depreciation expense increased by  or compared to this increase was due to the nine additional offices we acquired and the two denovo branches discussed above 
marketing expenses increased by  or year to year 
most of this increase relates to the continued checking account marketing campaign as well as an effort to develop internet related marking programs 
in addition  we grew in geographical markets as our branch network continues to grow 
data processing expenses increased by  or during compared to this increase was primarily due to conversion and merger related activities and adding additional offices 
the increase in the line item legal  accounting and other professional expenses was primarily due to consulting fees paid for services relating to managing foreclosure and repossessed properties  outsourcing fees related to certain internal audit functions  and increases in legal fees associated with various new and potentially new business lines and various regulatory issues 
loss from the sale of repossessed real estate  loss from the write down in valuation of repossessed real estate and losses from other repossessed assets as well as foreclosure related expenses as a group was  during compared to  during  resulting in an increase of  or 
the increase was reflective of the continuing deterioration in the real estate market in florida and the economy in general 
income tax benefit we recognized an income tax benefit for the year ended december  of  an effective tax rate of compared to an income tax benefit of  an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the reason our effective tax rates are higher than our statutory tax rate is because we had substantial tax exempt income in excess of non deductible expenses thereby increasing our taxable loss substantially above our book loss as recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
the table below demonstrates this difference 
year year loss before provision for income taxes net tax exempt income taxable loss statutory income tax rates income tax benefit effective tax rates 
table of contents comparison of balance sheets at december  and december  overview our total assets grew by  or  from  at december  to  at december  the increase was primarily due to our january acquisition of four branches  approximately  of loans and approximately  of deposits from td bank  na and our november acquisition of five branches  approximately  of loans and approximately  of deposits from hartford 
investment securities available for sale we account for our securities at fair value and classify them as available for sale  except for trading securities 
unrealized holding gains and losses are included as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of the effect of deferred income taxes 
if our management intends to sell or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss  the other than temporary impairment otti will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if our management does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss  the otti will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
the assessment of whether an otti decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time 
our available for sale portfolio totaled  at december  and  at december   or and  respectively  of total assets 
see the tables below for a summary of security type  maturity and average yield distributions 
we use our security portfolio primarily as a tool to manage our balance sheet  manage our regulatory capital ratios  as a source of liquidity and a base from which to pledge assets for repurchase agreements and public deposits 
when our liquidity position exceeds expected loan demand  other investments are considered as a secondary earnings alternative 
typically  we remain short term in our decision to invest in certain securities 
as these investments mature  they will be used to meet cash needs or will be reinvested to maintain a desired liquidity position 
we have designated all of our securities as available for sale  except our trading portfolio  to provide flexibility  in case an immediate need for liquidity arises 
we believe the composition of the portfolio offers flexibility in managing our liquidity position and interest rate sensitivity  without adversely impacting our regulatory capital levels 
the available for sale portfolio is carried at fair market value and had a net unrealized gain of approximately  at december   compared to a net unrealized gain of approximately  at december  we invest primarily in direct obligations of the united states  obligations guaranteed as to the principal and interest by the united states  mortgage backed securities  municipal securities and obligations of government sponsored entities and agencies of the united states

beginning balance purchases proceeds from sales net realized gain on sales mark to market adjustment ending balance loans lending related income is the most important component of our net interest income and is a major contributor to profitability 
the loan portfolio is the largest component of earning assets  and it therefore generates the largest portion of revenues 
the absolute volume of loans and the volume of loans as a percentage of earning assets is an important determinant of net interest margin as loans are expected to produce higher yields than securities and other

we will reimburse the fdic for its share of recoveries with respect to the covered loans 
the loss sharing agreements applicable to single family residential mortgage loans provide for fdic loss sharing and our reimbursement to the fdic for recoveries for ten years 
the loss sharing agreements applicable to commercial loans provides for fdic loss sharing for five years and our reimbursement to the fdic for a total of eight years for recoveries

the loans collateralized by real estate are further delineated as follows 
residential real estate loans these are single family home loans originated within our local market areas by employee loan officers or purchased from td bank  na and hartford with put back options  as described above 
we do not use loan brokers to originate loans for our own portfolio  nor do we acquire loans outside of our geographical markets 
the size of this portfolio is  representing approximately of our total loans  excluding those covered by fdic loss share agreements 
within this category there are approximately  non performing non accrual loans loans as of december  commercial real estate loans this is the largest category  of our loan portfolio representing approximately of our total loans  excluding those covered by fdic loss share agreements 
this category  along with commercial non real estate lending  is our primary business 
there is no significant concentration by type of property in this category but there is a geographical concentration such that the properties are all located in central florida 
the borrowers are a mix of professionals  doctors  lawyers  and other small business people 
approximately of these loans are owner occupied 
within this category there are approximately  non performing non accrual loans loans as of december  land  development and construction loans we have no construction or development loans with national builders 
we do business with local builders and developers that have typically been long time customers 
this category represents approximately  of our total loan portfolio

approximately  of loans in this category are non performing non accrual loans loans as of december   of which substantially all are collateralized by residential building lots  commercial building lots  undeveloped land and vacant land both residential and commercial 

table of contents loan concentrations are considered to exist where there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities  which collectively could be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions and when the total of such amounts would exceed of total capital 
due to the lack of diversified industry and the relative proximity of markets served  we have concentrations in geographic regions as well as in types of loans funded

table of contents the information presented in the above table is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity 
renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval  as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 
consequently  management believes this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio 
see liquidity and market risk management for a discussion regarding the repricing structure of the loan portfolio 
credit quality and allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is a charge to current period earnings and decreased by loan charge offs net of recoveries of prior period loan charge offs 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely 
the allowance consists of three components 
the first component consists of amounts reserved for impaired loans  as defined by asc impaired loans are those loans that management has estimated will not repay as agreed pursuant to the loan contract 
each of these loans is required to have a written analysis supporting the amount of specific reserve allocated to the particular loan  if any 
that is to say  a loan may be impaired ie not expected to repay as agreed  but may be sufficiently collateralized such that we expect to recover all principle and interest eventually  and therefore no specific reserve is warranted 
the second component is a general reserve on all of our loans other than those identified as impaired and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors 
the historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced over the most recent two years 
this actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment 
the following portfolio segments have been identified residential real estate loans first mortgage residential real estate second mortgage residential real estate home equity lines of credit commercial real estate loans apartment loans commercial real estate other than multifamily apartment loans construction  development  land loans commercial loans not collateralized by real estate consumer and other loans not collateralized by real estate the historical loss factors for each portfolio segment is adjusted for current internal and external environmental factors  as well as for certain loan grading factors 
the environmental factors that we consider are listed below 
we consider changes in the levels of and trends in past due loans  non accrual loans and impaired loans  and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans 
also  we consider changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans 
we consider levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries 
we consider changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans 
we consider changes in lending policies  procedures and practices  including changes in underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses 
we also consider changes in the quality of our loan review system 

table of contents we consider changes in the experience  ability  and depth of our lending management and other relevant staff 
we consider changes in international  national  regional  and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectibility of the portfolio  including the condition of various market segments national and local economic trends and conditions 
we consider the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in our existing portfolio industry conditions 
we consider the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations 
the third component consists of amounts reserved for purchased credit impaired loans 
on a quarterly basis  the company updates the amount of loan principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected  incorporating assumptions regarding default rates  loss severities  the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions 
probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows trigger the recognition of impairment  which is then measured as the present value of the expected principal loss plus any related foregone interest cash flows discounted at the pool s effective interest rate 
impairments that occur after the acquisition date are recognized through the provision for loan losses 
probable and significant increases in expected principal cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses  any remaining increases are recognized prospectively as interest income 
the impacts of i prepayments  ii changes in variable interest rates  and iii any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows are recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income 
disposals of loans  which may include sales of loans  receipt of payments in full by the borrower  or foreclosure  result in removal of the loan from the purchased credit impaired portfolio 
the aggregate of these three components results in our total allowance for loan losses

the general loan loss allowance non impaired loans increased by  or bps to of non impaired loan balance outstanding as of the end of the current period as compared to at the end of the previous period 

table of contents this is a result of changes in historical charge off rates  changes in current environmental factors and changes in the loan portfolio mix 
currently  there is no general loan loss allowance associated with the performing loans purchased from td bank and for the ftb performing loans purchased from hartford for the reasons described in notes and above 
the specific loan loss allowance impaired loans is the aggregate of the results of individual analyses prepared for each one of the impaired loans not covered by an fdic loss sharing agreement on a loan by loan basis 
we recorded partial charge offs in lieu of specific allowance for a number of the impaired loans 
the company s impaired loans have been written down by  to   when the  specific allowance is considered from their legal unpaid principal balance outstanding of  as such  in the aggregate  our total impaired loans have been written down to approximately of their legal unpaid principal balance 
any losses in loans covered by fdic loss share agreements  as described in note above  are reimbursable from the fdic to the extent of of any losses 
these loans are being accounted for pursuant to asc topic on a quarterly basis  the company updates the amount of loan principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected  incorporating assumptions regarding default rates  loss severities  the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions 
probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows trigger the recognition of impairment  which is then measured as the present value of the expected principal loss plus any related foregone interest cash flows discounted at the pool s effective interest rate 
impairments that occur after the acquisition date are recognized through the provision for loan losses 
we believe our allowance for loan losses was adequate at december  however  we recognize that many factors can adversely impact various segments of the company s market and customers  and therefore there is no assurance as to the amount of losses or probable losses which may develop in the future 
the table below summarizes the changes in allowance for loan losses during the previous five years

table of contents non performing loans consist of non accrual loans and loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  excluding loans covered by fdic loss share agreements 
non performing assets consist of non performing loans plus a oreo ie real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure  b other repossessed assets that are not real estate  and c are not covered by fdic loss share agreements 
we place loans on non accrual status when they are past due days and management believes the borrower s financial condition  after giving consideration to economic conditions and collection efforts  is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
when we place a loan on non accrual status  interest accruals cease and uncollected interest is reversed and charged against current income 
subsequent collections reduce the principal balance of the loan until the loan is returned to accrual status or interest is recognized only to extent received in cash 
the largest component of non performing loans is non accrual loans  which as of december  totaled  loans  excluding loans covered by fdic loss share agreements 
this amount is further delineated by loan category as follows non accrual loans at aggregate loan amounts of non accrual by category number of loans residential real estate commercial real estate land  development  construction commercial consumer and other total the other component of non performing loans are loans past due greater than days and still accruing interest 
loans which are past due greater than days are placed on non accrual status  unless they are both well secured and in the process of collection 
at december   total oreo was  of this amount   was acquired pursuant to the acquisition of three failed financial institutions during the third quarter of the acquired oreo is covered by fdic loss sharing agreements 
pursuant to the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the fdic is obligated to reimburse the company for of losses with respect to the covered oreo beginning with the first dollar of loss incurred  subject to the terms of the agreements 
the company will reimburse the fdic for its share of recoveries with respect to the covered oreo 
the loss sharing agreements applicable to single family residential mortgage loans provide for fdic loss sharing and our reimbursement to the fdic for recoveries for ten years 
the loss sharing agreements applicable to commercial loans provides for fdic loss sharing for five years and our reimbursement to the fdic for a total of eight years for recoveries 
oreo not covered by fdic loss share agreements was  at december   and is included in our non performing assets npa 
oreo is carried at the lower of cost or market less the estimated cost to sell 
further declines in real estate values can affect the market value of these assets 
any further decline in market value beyond its cost basis is recorded as a current expense in our statement of operations 
the current carrying value represents approximately of the unpaid legal balance of the related loan when the asset was repossessed 
oreo is further delineated in the following table

management considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that we will not be repaid as agreed pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
once the loan has been identified as impaired  a written analysis is performed to determine if there is a potential for a loss 
if it is probable that a loss may occur  a specific allowance  or a partial charge down  for that particular loan is then recognized 
the loan is then placed on non accrual status and included in non performing loans 
if the analysis indicates that a loss is not probable  then no specific allowance  or partial charge down  is recognized

table of contents in this current distressed real estate market that the nation in general and florida in particular have been experiencing  it has become more common to restructure or modify the terms of certain loans under certain conditions 
in certain circumstances it may be more beneficial to restructure the terms of a loan and work with the borrower for the benefit of both parties  versus forcing the property into foreclosure and having to dispose of it in an unfavorable and depressed real estate market 
when we have modified the terms of a loan  we usually reduce the monthly payment for generally about twelve to eighteen months 
we have approximately  of troubled debt restructures tdrs 
of this amount  are performing pursuant to their modified terms  and  are not performing and have been placed on non accrual status and included in our non performing loans npls 
current accounting standards require tdrs to be included in our impaired loans  whether they are performing or not performing 
only non performing tdrs are included in our npls

tdrs accruing non accrual total real estate loans residential commercial construction  development  land total real estate loans commercial consumer and other total tdrs our policy is to return non accrual tdr loans to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due  pursuant to its modified terms  are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
our policy also considers the payment history of the borrower  but is not dependent upon a specific number of payments 
loans are modified to minimize loan losses when we believe the modification will improve the borrower s financial condition and ability to repay the loan 
generally we do not forgive principal  we generally either

on the other hand   or approximately of our total tdrs are not performing pursuant to their modified terms 
long term success with our performing tdrs is an unknown  and will depend to a great extent on the future of our economy and our local real estate markets 
the decrease in tdrs is mainly due to loan sales of both performing and nonperforming loans and partial charge offs of nonperforming loans 
thus far  there does not appear to be any significant difference in success rates with one type of concession versus another 
non performing tdrs average approximately months in age from their modification date through december  performing tdrs average approximately months in age from their modification date through december  we are continually analyzing our loan portfolio in an effort to recognize and resolve our problem assets as quickly and efficiently as possible 
while we believe we use the best information available at the time to make a determination with respect to the allowance for loan losses  we recognize that many factors can adversely impact various segments of our markets  and subsequent adjustments in the allowance may be necessary if future economic indications or other factors differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determination or if regulatory policies change 
we continuously focus our attention on promptly identifying and providing for potential problem loans  as they arise 
the table below summarizes our accruing loans past due greater than days and less than days for the periods presented  excluding loans covered by fdic loss share agreements 
december past due loans days as percentage of total loans although the total allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses from all loans  management allocates the allowance among loan portfolio categories for informational and regulatory reporting purposes 
regulatory examiners may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based upon the regulators judgments about the information available to them at the time of their examination  which may differ from our judgments about the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents while no portion of the allowance is in any way restricted to any individual loan or group of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans  the following table summarizes our allocation of allowance for loan losses by loan category and loans in each category as a percentage of total loans  for the periods presented  excluding loans covered by fdic loss share agreements

these arrangements are not transactions with investment bankers or brokerage firms  but rather  with several of our larger commercial customers who periodically have excess cash balances and do not want to keep those balances in non interest bearing checking accounts 
because our banks are not permitted to pay interest on commercial checking accounts  we offer an arrangement through a

liquidity and market risk management market and public confidence in our financial strength and financial institutions in general will largely determine our access to appropriate levels of liquidity 
this confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves 
liquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis 
we measure our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on and off balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily and weekly basis 
liquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate based liabilities  as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs 
liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations cost effectively and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments  lease obligations  and unexpected deposit outflows 
in this process  we focus on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the rate sensitive position  or gap  is the difference in the volume of rate sensitive assets and liabilities  at a given time interval  including both floating rate instruments and instruments which are approaching maturity 
the measurement of our interest rate sensitivity  or gap  is one of the principal techniques we use in our asset liability management effort 
each of our banks generally attempts to maintain a range set by policy between rate sensitive assets and liabilities by repricing periods 
the range set by the banks has been approved by their board of directors 
if any of our banks fall outside their pre approved range  it requires board action and board approval  by that particular bank s board of directors 
the asset mix of our balance sheet is evaluated continually in terms of several variables yield  credit quality  and appropriate funding sources and liquidity 
management of the liability mix of the balance sheet focuses on expanding the various funding sources 
our gap and liquidity positions are reviewed periodically to determine whether or not changes in policies and procedures are necessary to achieve financial goals 
at december   approximately of total gross loans were adjustable rate 
approximately of our investment securities  fair value are invested in us government agency mortgage backed securities 
although most of these have maturities in excess of five years  these are amortizing instruments that generate cash flows each month 
the duration average life of expected cash flows of our securities at december  was approximately years 
deposit liabilities  at that date  consisted of approximately  in now accounts   in money market accounts and savings   in time deposits and  in non interest bearing demand accounts 

table of contents the table below presents the market risk associated with our financial instruments 
in the rate sensitivity analysis table  rate sensitive assets and liabilities are shown by repricing periods 
the estimated fair value of each instrument category is also shown in the table 
while these estimates of fair value are based on our judgment of the most appropriate factors  there is no assurance that  if we had to dispose of such instruments at december   the estimated fair values would necessarily have been achieved at that date  since market values may differ depending on various circumstances 
the estimated fair values at december   should not necessarily be considered to apply at subsequent dates

table of contents as stated earlier  the rate sensitivity table above summarizes our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by repricing periods at a point in time 
it does not include assumptions about sensitivity to changes in various interest rates by asset or liability type  correlation between macro environment market rates and specific product types  lag periods  cash flows or other assumptions and projections 
however  in addition to static gap analysis  our banks also use simulation models to estimate the sensitivity of their net interest income to changes in interest rates 
simulation is a better technique than gap analysis because variables are changed for the various rate conditions 
each category s interest change is calculated as rates ramp up and down 
in addition  the repayment speeds and repricing speeds are changed 
rate shock is a method for stress testing the net interest margin over the next four quarters under several rate change levels 
these levels span in bps increments up and down from the current interest rates 
in order to simulate activity  maturing balances are replaced with the new balances at the new rate level  and repricing balances are adjusted to the new rate shock level 
the interest is recalculated for each level along with the new average yield 
net interest margin is then calculated and a margin risk profile is developed 
the results of these calculations  as of december  looking four quarters into the future  for our combined banks  are summarized in the table below 
change in interest rates bps bps bps bps bps bps bps resulting effect on net interest income a current a the percentage change in each of these boxes represents a percentage change from the net interest income dollars that the models projected for the next four quarters 
to put this in perspective  as an example  our net interest income for was  assuming a bps decrease in rates  our model is suggesting that our net interest income would decrease by  or approximately  likewise  assuming a bps increase in rates  our model is suggesting that our net interest income would increase by  or approximately  it is important to reiterate again  that these models are built on a multitude of assumptions and predictions 
this is not an exact science 
the benefit that we see is measuring our overall interest rate risk profile 
although we are by no means suggesting the exactness of the numbers above  what we see as a take away is that in general  it appears that if market interest rates increase  it would suggest a benefit to our net interest income 
if market interest rates decrease  it would suggest a negative effect on our net interest income 
we believe that our interest rate risk is manageable and under control as of december  simulation and rate shock stress testing our net interest income nim is a forward looking analysis 
that is  it estimates  based on various assumptions  what the effect on our nim might be given various changes in future interest rates 
another way of analyzing our interest rate risk profile is looking at history 
the table below measures the correlation between our nim and market interest rates over an eleven year period starting at the beginning of and ending on december  we used the prime lending rate as a surrogate for market interest rates 
this simple correlation is not perfect because we ignore changes in duration of our asset liability portfolio over time and changes in the slope of the yield curve over time  as well as other significant environmental changes that may occur  such as the recent banking crisis 
however  it will demonstrate that over time our asset liability portfolio generally tended to be asset sensitive 
that is  in general  over this historical period  when market interest rates increased  our nim increased  and when market interest rates decreased  our nim decreased 
in the following table  the prime rate is measured by the vertical bars  and their scale is on the left hand side of the graph 
each bar represents a month 
our nim is represented by the line graph and its scale is on the right hand side of the graph 
the line graph is connecting a series of dots  which represents our nim for a given quarter 

table of contents net interest margin vs 
prime logo managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process 
our philosophy is to not try to guess the market in either direction 
we do not want to be excessively assets sensitive or excessively liability sensitive 
we try to manage our asset liability portfolio with the goal of optimizing our yield without taking on excessive interest rate risk 
contractual obligations while our liquidity monitoring and management considers both present and future demands for and sources of liquidity  the following table of contractual commitments focuses only on our future obligations 
in the table  all deposits with indeterminate maturities  such as demand deposits  checking accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts  are presented as having a maturity of one year or less

the bank regulatory agencies have established risk based capital requirements for banks 
these guidelines are intended to provide an additional measure of a bank s capital adequacy by assigning weighted levels of risk to asset categories 
banks are also required to systematically maintain capital against such off balance sheet activities as loans sold with recourse  loan commitments  guarantees and standby letters of credit 
these guidelines are intended to strengthen the quality of capital by increasing the emphasis on common equity and restricting the amount of loan loss reserves and other forms of equity such as preferred stock that may be included in capital 
each of our subsidiary banks objective is to maintain its current status as a well capitalized institution as that term is defined by its regulators 
under the terms of the guidelines  banks must meet minimum capital adequacy based upon both total assets and risk adjusted assets 
all banks are required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of  a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier capital to average assets of leverage ratio 
in addition  our lead subsidiary bank  centerstate bank of florida  na has committed to the occ  it s primary regulators  that it will maintain an leverage ratio tier capital divided by average assets 
adherence to these guidelines has not had an adverse impact on our company 
selected consolidated capital ratios at december   and were as follows capital ratios dollars are in thousands actual well capitalized excess amount ratio amount ratio amount as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets 
table of contents effects of inflation and changing prices the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
in addition  inflation affects financial institutions increased cost of goods and services purchased  the cost of salaries and benefits  occupancy expense  and similar items 
inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity  earnings  and shareholders equity 
commercial and other loan originations and refinancings tend to slow as interest rates increase  and can reduce our earnings from such activities 
off balance sheet arrangements we generally do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  other than approved and unfunded loans and letters and lines of credit to our customers in the ordinary course of business

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of economic loss from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in a interest rates  b foreign exchange rates  or c other factors that relate to market volatility of the rate  index  or price underlying the financial instrument 
our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
each of our subsidiary banks has an asset liability committee alco which is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position  and establishing policies to monitor and limit the exposure to interest rate risk for their specific bank 
substantially all of our interest rate risk exposure relates to the financial instrument activity of each of our subsidiary banks 
as such  the board of directors of each subsidiary bank is responsible to review and approve the policies and guidelines established by their bank s alco 
the primary objective of asset liability management is to provide an optimum and stable net interest margin  after tax return on assets and return on equity capital  as well as adequate liquidity and capital 
interest rate risk is measured and monitored through gap analysis  which measures the amount of repricing risk associated with the balance sheet at specific points in time
