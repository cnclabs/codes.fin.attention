item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reserve for losses and loss expenses and note reserve for losses and loss expenses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
enterprise risk management we have developed a strong risk management culture within the company through the establishment of various processes and controls focused on the company s risk exposures 
our enterprise risk management erm activities are critical to the organization s senior management  business units and board of directors 
the goals of our erm framework that drive our corporate strategy are as follows identify and manage the risks that threaten the company and its solvency  optimize the company s risk based capital position  maximize the company s risk adjusted returns on capital  manage underwriting  investment and operational volatility  and clearly communicate our approach to our employees and external constituencies 
in order to meet our erm goals  the company has established risk tolerances applicable to all areas of our business 
it is our corporate objective to limit the risk of a significant loss on an economic basis from a one in one hundred year series of catastrophic events to no more than of our shareholders equity 
we define economic basis as premiums plus net investment income less incurred losses and loss expenses  acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses 
on a group basis  we monitor our capital position relative to our internal requirements and the requirements of our regulators and rating agencies  and liquidity by stressing cash outflow scenarios relative to available cash and cash equivalents and other forms of liquidity 
in addition  we have developed processes  models and a detailed internal control structure to specifically address our risk exposures 
the company s primary risk exposure areas are as follows underwriting risk  including certain key underwriting risks associated with the pricing and exposure evaluation process  catastrophe correlation aggregation risk  the risk embedded in the loss reserve estimation process  investment risk  and operational risk 
the following sections more specifically address our method and procedures for addressing and managing our underwriting  catastrophe  loss reserving  investment and operational risks 

table of contents underwriting risk management internal underwriting controls are established by our chief executive officer  president and chief underwriting officer 
underwriting authority is delegated to the managers of our lines of business in each business segment and to underwriters in accordance with corporate risk tolerances  prudent practice and underwriting capabilities 
detailed letters of underwriting authority are issued to each of our underwriters 
these underwriting authority letters reference our operating guidelines and a description of the analytic process to be followed 
the underwriting authority letters additionally include referral requirements by lines of business  terms  conditions  risk exposures  transactional situations  and limits and premium capacity 
our return on capital guidelines are attached to each letter as an exhibit and are stated in terms of maximum combined ratio targets  excluding our general and administrative expenses  and minimum return on risk based capital by line of business 
our return on capital guidelines are regularly reviewed by our chief executive officer  president  chief underwriting officer and our chief risk officer to reflect changes in market conditions  interest rates  capital requirements and market expected returns 
in addition  oversight of underwriting and risk management is provided by our board of directors and its underwriting and risk committees 
for a further discussion on the role of our board of directors in the company s risk management  see role of the board of directors in risk management below 
we have a disciplined approach to underwriting and risk management that relies heavily upon the collective underwriting expertise of our management and staff 
this expertise is in turn guided by the following underwriting principles we will underwrite and accept only those risks we know and understand  we will perform our own independent pricing or risk review on all risks we accept  and we will accept only those risks that are expected to earn a return on capital commensurate with the risk they present 
before we review any natural catastrophe exposed insurance or reinsurance proposal  we consider the appropriateness of the client  including the quality of its management and its risk management strategy 
in addition  we require each proposal to include significant information on the nature of the perils to be included and detailed aggregate information as to the location or locations of the risks covered 
we further request information on the client s loss history for the perils being insured or reinsured  together with relevant underwriting considerations 
if a proposal meets the preceding underwriting criteria  we then evaluate the proposal in terms of its risk reward profile to assess the adequacy of the proposed pricing and its potential impact on our overall return on capital as well as our corporate risk objectives 
we have fully integrated our internal actuarial staff into the underwriting and decision making process 
we use in depth actuarial and risk analyses to evaluate contracts prior to authorization 
in addition to internal actuaries and risk professionals  we make use of outside consultants as necessary to develop appropriate analyses for pricing 
separate from our natural catastrophe exposed businesses  we underwrite and accept casualty and specialty insurance and reinsurance business 
we apply the same standards with respect to actuarial and risk analysis to these businesses using commercial data and models licensed from various professional service firms 
as with our natural catastrophe exposed businesses  we seek to identify those casualty and specialty exposures that are most likely to be simultaneously influenced by significant events 
these exposures are then jointly tracked to ensure that we do not develop an excessive accumulation of exposure to that particular type of event 
in addition to the above technical and analytical practices  our underwriters use a variety of tools  including specific contract terms  to manage our exposure to loss 
these include occurrence limits  aggregate limits  reinstatement provisions and loss ratio caps 
additionally  our underwriters use appropriate exclusions  terms and conditions to further eliminate particular risks or exposures that our underwriting team deems to be outside of the intent of the coverage we are willing to offer 
our bermuda underwriting location provides us with a particular advantage for certain lines of business because there are no regulatory limitations upon our use of coverage restrictions in insurance policies 
in our crop insurance business  we have invested in an experienced team of crop  commodity and economic analysts who have developed proprietary tools to manage risk  pricing and exposure in this business 
these proprietary tools are constructed from databases that involve a comprehensive set of historical profit and loss experience data developed at a crop  state  county and farm level of detail 
we further analyze this data based on current and forecasted crop growing conditions  agriculture commodity prices  and market conditions in an effort to produce attractive returns 
in certain cases  the risks assumed by the company are partially reinsured with third party reinsurers 
reinsurance ceded varies by segment and line of business based on a number of factors  including market conditions 
the benefits of ceding risks include reducing exposure on individual risks  protecting against catastrophic risks  maintaining acceptable capital ratios and enabling the writing of additional business 
reinsurance ceded does not legally discharge the company from its liabilities to the original policyholder in respect of the risk being reinsured 
for more information on the company s reinsurance ceded  please see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ceded reinsurance and note reinsurance in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the company 

table of contents catastrophe risk management to achieve our catastrophe risk management objectives  we utilize a variety of proprietary and commercially available tools to quantify and monitor the various risks we accept as a company 
our catastrophe modeling tools  which include both proprietary and licensed software  use exposure data provided by our insureds and ceding company clients to simulate catastrophic losses 
we take an active role in the evaluation of commercial catastrophe models  providing feedback to the modeling companies to improve the efficiencies of their models 
we also supplement the model output in certain territories with the results of our proprietary models and lessons learned from actual catastrophe events 
we use modeling not just for the underwriting of individual transactions but also to optimize the total return and risk of our underwriting portfolio 
we have high standards for the quality and levels of detailed exposure data provided by our clients and have an expressed preference for data at the zip code or postal code level or finer 
data provided at more summary levels  such as counties or cresta zones  is conservatively modeled and surcharged for increased uncertainty 
we require significant amounts of data from our clients and decline business in which we feel the data provided is insufficient to make an appropriate analysis 
our commitment to detailed exposure data has precluded significant involvement as a retrocessionaire in the current market 
data output from the software described above is incorporated in our proprietary models 
our proprietary systems include those for modeling risks associated with property catastrophe  healthcare liability  aerospace and marine  agriculture  property and workers compensation business  various casualty and specialty pricing models as well as our proprietary portfolio risk management and capital allocation models 
these systems allow us to monitor our pricing and risk on a contract by contract basis in each of our segments and business lines 
data output from both our licensed and proprietary software models is used to estimate the amount of premium that is required to pay the long term expected losses under the proposed contracts 
the data output is also used to estimate correlation between both new business and our existing portfolio 
the degree of correlation is used to estimate the incremental capital required to support our participation on each proposed risk  allowing us to calculate a return on consumed capital 
finally  the data output is used to monitor and control our cumulative exposure to individual perils across all of our businesses 
our pricing of catastrophe reinsurance contracts is based on a combination of modeled loss estimates  actual ceding company loss history  surcharges for potential unmodeled exposures  fixed and variable expense estimates and profit requirements 
the profit requirements are based on incremental capital usage estimates described above and on our required return on consumed capital 
loss reserving risk management establishing reserves for losses and loss expenses  in particular reserves for the company s long tail lines of business  constitutes a significant risk for the company 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability  but instead are estimates of what the company expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost 
to the extent the company determines that actual losses and loss expenses exceed the loss reserves recorded in our financial statements  the company will be required to increase its reserve for losses and loss expenses which in turn could cause a material reduction in the company s profitability and capital 
the company manages the risk inherent in estimating the company s reserves for losses and loss expenses in a variety of ways 
first  the company underwrites a balanced and diversified portfolio of business  which reduces the company s susceptibility to reserving errors that may be associated with any one line or type of business 
in  the company s largest single line of business represented of the gross premiums written by the company 
second  where loss development uncertainty exists  the company makes select use of the purchase of reinsurance to reduce the company s exposure to such loss development uncertainty  in particular in our insurance lines of business 
third  the company incorporates uncertainty in loss trends into its underwriting pricing process 
finally  in its reinsurance business  the company conducts active  regular audits of its ceding company clients with the intent of identifying quickly and thoroughly exposures assumed by the company 
the company s reserving process also serves to mitigate the risk associated with the company s loss and loss expense reserve estimates 
the company seeks to base its loss reserve estimates upon actuarial and statistical projections derived from the most recently available data  as well as current information on future trends in claims severity and frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors 
the company continually refines both its loss reserve estimates and the means by which its loss reserve estimates are derived  incorporating an ongoing process of developing loss experience  reported claims and claims settlements 
investment risk management investment risk encompasses the risk of loss in our investment portfolio potentially caused by the adverse impact on our invested assets from fluctuations in interest rates  equity prices  credit spreads  foreign currency rates and other market changes 
the company manages its investment risks through both a system of limits and a strategy to optimize the interaction of risks and opportunities 
to ensure diversification of the company s investment portfolio and avoid aggregation of risks  limits on asset types  economic sector exposure  industry exposure and individual security exposure are placed on our investment portfolio  and monitored on an ongoing basis 
the company manages its interest rate risk through an asset liability management strategy that 
table of contents involves the selection of investments with appropriate characteristics  such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity that are tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our liabilities and the anticipated interest rate environment 
the company manages foreign currency risk by seeking to match the company s liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with assets  such as including cash and investments  that are denominated in such currencies 
in order to limit the company s exposure to credit risk  the company s investment policy is to invest primarily in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories and any one issuer 
the company s investment policy sets limits for individual credit exposures based on credit rating 
the company manages equity risk by limiting the overall size of investment in equities 
the company uses a number of capital at risk models  which include volatility scenario based measures and value at risk var and credit impairment calculations to evaluate its investment portfolio risk 
our capital at risk models also include the measures of risk capital applied by standard poor s s p and am best company am best in their risk based capital assessments of the company 
volatility scenario based measures are used in order to stress test the portfolio for expected changes in specific market scenarios 
var is a probabilistic method of measuring the potential loss in portfolio value over a given time period and for a given distribution of historical returns 
portfolio risk  as measured by var  is affected by four primary risk factors asset concentration  asset volatility  asset correlation and systematic risk 
the company adjusts its investment risk scenarios for a variety of extremes as well as expected outcomes 
management continuously evaluates the applicability and relevance of the models used and makes adjustments as necessary to reflect actual market conditions and performance over time 
operational risk management operational risk represents the risk of loss as a result of inadequate or failed internal processes  system failures  human error or external events 
operational risks include  for example  employee or third party fraud  business interruptions  inaccurate processing of transactions  information technology failures  the loss of key employees without appropriate successors  and non compliance with reporting obligations 
the company seeks to mitigate operational risks through the application of strong process controls throughout our business 
key process controls include underwriting authority letters  underwriting referral protocols  claims procedures guidelines  financial reporting controls and procedures  information technology procedures  the disaster recovery plan and the business continuity plan 
the company s internal audit department and operational audit personnel rigorously test the company s various process controls on a regular basis 
the use by the company of the services of unaffiliated third parties exposes the company to heightened operational risks  including the risk of information technology and physical security breaches  fraud  non compliance with laws and regulations or internal guidelines and inadequate service 
the company mitigates the operational risk posed by the use of third party vendors by verifying  among other items  a potential third party vendor s financial stability  ability to provide ongoing service  business continuity planning and its business reputation 
the company also allocates appropriate resources to monitor any significant third party relationships 
role of the board of directors in risk management the company s board of directors administers its risk oversight of the company through quarterly meetings of its risk committee with members of senior management  including representatives from the actuarial  claims  finance  internal audit  investment  legal and underwriting functions within the organization 
the risk committee s members review with senior management the company s enterprise risk management framework and related policies  processes and procedures 
the risk committee members review with management the methods utilized by the company to identify and quantify risks associated with the company s business and operations and the company s established risk tolerances and evaluate the company s professional development plans for key risk management functions 
in particular  the risk committee members monitor the company s key risks  risk based capital position relative to internal standards and the requirements of the company s regulators and rating agencies and the company s stressed liquidity position based upon a series of adverse cash flow scenarios and periodically approves the level of risk assumed by the company in its underwriting  investment and operational activities 
investments we follow an investment strategy designed to preserve book value growth and generate appropriate risk adjusted returns while providing sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of the company 
the portfolio is designed to diversify risks  including interest rate  credit and structure risks 
our investment portfolio is managed by our chief investment officer and a team of investment professionals 
our investment team is experienced in direct portfolio management  asset allocation  managing external investment manager relationships  risk management and auditing and accounting 
our investment team uses specialized analytical tools to evaluate risk and potential investments to facilitate a risk managed  opportunity oriented approach to investing consistent with the requirements of the company s investment policy 
we utilize external portfolio managers to oversee most of the day to day activities of our investment portfolio  and our investment professionals actively monitor our investment managers performance within the established investment policy of the company 
during  we began managing a portion of our investment portfolio internally 
internally managed assets were of total invested assets at december  

table of contents our investment policy establishes authority for our investment activities and specifies risk tolerances and minimum criteria on the overall credit quality and liquidity characteristics of the portfolio 
this includes limitations on the size of certain holdings as well as restrictions on purchasing certain types of securities or investing in certain industries 
our investment managers may be instructed to invest some of the investment portfolio in currencies other than us dollars based upon the business we have written  the currency in which our loss reserves are denominated or regulatory requirements 
our investment policy incorporates a traditional policy limit approach to each type of risk  thus setting a maximum amount of capital that may be exposed at any one time to particular types of securities and investment vehicles 
we develop and maintain an investment risk profile and risk budget  which is reviewed by the investment committee of the company s board of directors and includes estimates of the maximum and expected levels of risk relative to the company s shareholders equity that will be taken over a specified period 
in determining our investment decisions  we consider the impact of various catastrophic events on our invested assets  particularly those to which our insurance and reinsurance portfolio may also be exposed  in order to protect our financial position 
the investment risk profile is reviewed by the investment committee and is revised based on market conditions and developing needs of the company 
in addition  as part of our risk management processes  we maintain a watch list of securities that management considers to be at risk due to industry and or company specific issues or securities potentially subject to future impairments 
these securities are subjected to further internal analysis to evaluate their underlying structures  credit characteristics and overall industry and security specific fundamentals until they are sold  mature or it is deemed that further review is no longer necessary

ratings financial strength ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies 
endurance holdings and certain of its operating subsidiaries maintain a financial strength rating at moody s of a  with a stable outlook  an am best rating of a excellent  with a stable outlook  and an s p rating of a strong with a stable outlook 
all three ratings agencies conducted reviews of endurance holdings during the objective of s p s  am best s and moody s rating systems is to provide an opinion of an insurer s or reinsurer s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders and debt holders 
these ratings reflect s p s  am best s and moody s opinions of our capitalization  performance and management  and are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold the company s securities 
s p maintains a letter rating system ranging from aaa extremely strong to r under regulatory supervision 
within these categories  aaa extremely strong is the highest  followed by aa  aa and aa very strong and a  a and a strong 
publications of s p indicate that the a  a and a ratings are assigned to those companies that  in s p s opinion  have demonstrated strong financial security characteristics  but are somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings 
these ratings may be changed  suspended  or withdrawn at the discretion of s p 
the rating a strong by s p is the sixth highest of twenty one rating levels 
am best maintains a letter scale rating system ranging from a superior to f in liquidation  and includes separate ratings categories 
within these categories  a superior and a superior are the highest  followed by a excellent and a excellent 
publications of am best indicate that the a and a ratings are assigned to those companies that  in am best s opinion  have demonstrated an excellent ability to meet their obligations to policyholders 
these ratings are subject to periodic review by  and may be revised at the sole discretion of  am best 
the rating a excellent by am best is the third highest of rating levels 
moody s maintains a letter rating system ranging from aaa to c 
within these categories  aaa is the highest  followed by aa and a 
within each of these categories  ratings are further broken down into aa  aa and aa ratings may be changed  suspended  or withdrawn at the discretion of moody s 
the rating a by moody s is the sixth highest of twenty one rating levels 
competition the insurance and reinsurance industries are mature and highly competitive 
insurance and reinsurance companies compete on the basis of many factors  including premium charges  general reputation and perceived financial strength  the terms and conditions of the products offered  ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  speed of claims payments  reputation and experience in the particular risk to be underwritten  the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized  capacity and coverages offered and various other factors 
these factors operate at the individual market participant level and in the aggregate across the insurance and reinsurance industry more generally 
in addition  background economic conditions and variations in the insurance and reinsurance buying practices of insureds and ceding companies  by participant and in the aggregate  contribute to cyclical movements in rates  terms and conditions and may impact industry aggregate financial results 

table of contents we compete in the bermuda  us  london and international insurance and reinsurance markets directly with numerous other parties  including established global insurance and reinsurance companies  start up insurance and reinsurance entities  as well as potential capital markets and securitization structures aimed at managing catastrophe and other risks 
many of these entities have significantly larger amounts of capital and more employees than we maintain and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry  which can be a significant competitive advantage 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
regulatory matters general the business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries  although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another 
reinsurers are generally subject to less direct regulation than primary insurers 
bermuda the insurance act of bermuda and related regulations  as amended the insurance act  regulates the insurance business of endurance bermuda and provides that no person may carry on any insurance business in or from within bermuda unless registered as an insurer by the bermuda monetary authority bma under the insurance act 
endurance bermuda is registered as a class insurer by the bma 
as a holding company  endurance holdings is not subject to bermuda insurance regulations 
insurance  as well as reinsurance  is regulated under the insurance act 
the bma  in deciding whether to grant registration  has broad discretion to act as it thinks fit in the public interest 
the continued registration of an applicant as an insurer is subject to it complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the bma may impose from time to time 
the day to day supervision of insurers is the responsibility of the bma 
the bma utilizes a risk based approach when it comes to licensing and supervising insurance companies in bermuda 
as part of the bma s risk based system  an assessment of the inherent risks within each particular class of insurer is utilized in the first instance to determine the limitations and specific requirements which may be imposed 
thereafter  the bma keeps its analysis of relative risk within individual institutions under review on an ongoing basis  including through the scrutiny of regular audited statutory financial statements  and  as appropriate  meeting with senior management during onsite visits 
the bma has also adopted guidance notes the guidance notes in order to ensure those operating in bermuda have a good understanding of the nature of the requirements of  and the bma s approach in implementing  the insurance act 
the insurance act imposes solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements on bermuda insurance companies and grants the bma powers to supervise  investigate  require information and the production of documents and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies 
certain significant aspects of the bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below 
classification of insurers the insurance act distinguishes between insurers carrying on long term business and insurers carrying on general business 
there are six classifications of insurers carrying on general business  with class insurers subject to the strictest regulation 
endurance bermuda  which is incorporated to carry on general insurance and reinsurance business  is registered as a class insurer in bermuda and is regulated as such under the insurance act 
endurance bermuda is not licensed to carry on long term business 
cancellation of insurer s registration an insurer s registration may be canceled by the supervisor of insurance of the bma on certain grounds specified in the insurance act  including failure of the insurer to comply with its obligations under the insurance act or if  in the opinion of the bma after consultation with the insurance advisory committee  the insurer has not been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles 
principal representative an insurer is required to maintain a principal office in bermuda and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in bermuda 
for the purpose of the insurance act  endurance bermuda s principal office is its executive offices in pembroke  bermuda 
michael j 
mcguire has been appointed by the board of directors as endurance bermuda s principal representative and has been approved by the bma 
without a reason acceptable to the bma  an insurer may not terminate the appointment of its principal 
table of contents representative  and the principal representative may not cease to act as such  unless days notice in writing to bma is given of the intention to do so 
a principal representative shall forthwith notify the bma  in such a manner as it may direct  a on his reaching a view that there is a likelihood of the insurer for which he acts becoming insolvent  for instance the failure by the insurer to comply substantially with a condition imposed upon the insurer by the bma relating to a solvency margin or liquidity or other ratio would be a reportable event  b on its coming to his knowledge  or his having reason to believe  that an event to which the applicable section of the insurance act applies has occurred  under the amendment act these events now include i circumstances where a class insurer undergoes a material change to the nature of the business it underwrites  and ii a significant loss which is likely to render the insurer unable to comply with its enhanced capital requirement 
within days of such notification  the principal representative shall furnish the bma with a report in writing setting out all the particulars of the case that are available to him 
independent approved auditor every registered insurer must appoint an independent auditor who will audit and report annually on the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return of the insurer  both of which  in the case of endurance bermuda  are required to be filed annually with the bma 
endurance bermuda s independent auditor must be approved by the bma and may be the same person or firm that audits endurance holdings consolidated financial statements and reports for presentation to its shareholders 
loss reserve specialist as a registered class insurer  endurance bermuda is required to submit an opinion of its approved loss reserve specialist with its statutory financial return in respect of its losses and loss expenses provisions 
the loss reserve specialist  who will normally be a qualified property and casualty actuary  must be approved by the bma 
michael e 
angelina  chief actuary and chief risk officer for the company  has been appointed by our board of directors and has been approved by the bma to act as endurance bermuda s loss reserve specialist 
statutory and gaap financial statements an insurer must prepare and file annual statutory financial statements with the bma within four months from the end of the financial year to which they relate 
the insurance act prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of these statutory financial statements which include  in statutory form  a balance sheet  an income statement  a statement of capital and surplus and notes thereto 
the insurer is required to give detailed information and analyses regarding premiums  claims  reinsurance and investments 
the new accounts regime applicable to class insurers includes i a distinct methodology and new format to be applied when preparing and reporting the statutory balance sheet and statutory income statements for class insurers and ii accompanying explanatory notes to be added and instructions affecting each statutory statement 
the most significant aspect of the amended regulations in relation to the statutory balance sheet of class insurers is the reporting obligation to detail  on a line by line basis  specific asset and liability classes  as well as the requirement to identify and distinguish between what is or is not attributable to affiliates of the class insurer 
class insurers are required to prepare and file with the bma audited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap which applies in bermuda  uk  uk  or such other gaap as the bma may recognize or international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the audited financial statements are to be submitted within four months from the end of the financial year to which they relate or  if the class insurer makes an application to the bma  such longer period as may be allowed by the bma but no longer than seven months from the end of the financial year to which they relate 
the bma publishes on its website each such class insurer s gaap or ifrs audited financial statements 
in addition to the audited gaap or ifrs financial statements  class insurers are required to file with the bma statutory financial statements which are not prepared in accordance with us gaap and are distinct from the financial statements prepared for presentation to the insurer s shareholders under the companies act  which financial statements  in the case of the company  will be prepared in accordance with us gaap 
as a general business insurer  endurance bermuda is required to submit the annual statutory financial statements as part of the annual statutory financial return 
the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return do not form part of the public records maintained by the bma 
annual statutory financial return endurance bermuda is required to file with the bma a statutory financial return no later than four months after its financial year end unless specifically extended upon application to the bma 
the statutory financial return for a class insurer includes  among other matters  a report of the approved independent auditor on the statutory financial statements of the insurer  solvency certificates  the statutory financial statements  the opinion of the loss reserve specialist and a schedule of reinsurance ceded 
the solvency certificates must be signed by the principal representative and at least two directors of the insurer certifying that the minimum solvency margin  as well as the minimum liquidity ratio  has been met and whether the insurer complied with the conditions attached to its certificate of registration 
the independent auditor is required to state whether  in its opinion  it was reasonable for the 
table of contents directors to make these certifications and whether the declaration of the statutory ratios complies with the requirements of the insurance act 
if an insurer s accounts have been audited for any purpose other than compliance with the insurance act  a statement to that effect must be filed with the statutory financial return 
enhanced capital requirement ecr  minimum solvency margin msm and restrictions on dividends and distributions the bma has promulgated the insurance prudential standards class and class b solvency requirement rules  as amended the rules which  among other things  mandate that a class insurer s ecr be calculated by either a the model set out in schedule i to the rules  or b an internal capital model that the bma has approved for use for this purpose 
bermuda s risk based regulatory capital adequacy and solvency margin regime termed the bermuda solvency capital requirement bscr provides a risk based capital model as a tool to assist the bma both in measuring risk and in determining appropriate levels of capitalization 
the bscr employs a standard mathematical model that correlates the risk underwritten by bermuda insurers to the capital that is dedicated to their business 
the framework that has been developed  applies a standard measurement format to the risk associated with an insurer s assets  liabilities and premiums  including a formula to take account of the catastrophe risk exposure and operating risks 
in order to minimise the risk of a shortfall in capital arising from an unexpected adverse deviation  the bma seeks that insurers operate at or above a threshold capital level termed the target capital level tcl  which exceeds the bscr or approved internal model minimum amounts 
the rules provide prudential standards in relation to the ecr and capital and solvency return csr 
the ecr is determined using the bscr or an approved internal model  provided that at all times the ecr must be an amount equal to  or exceeding the msm 
the csr is the return setting out the insurers risk management practices and other information used by the insurer to calculate its approved internal model ecr 
bermuda s new capital requirements require class insurers to hold available statutory capital and surplus equal to or exceeding ecr and set tcl at of ecr 
the bma also has a degree of discretion enabling it to impose ecr on insurers in particular cases  for instance where an insurer falls below the tcl 
in those cases  the new risk based capital model should be supplemented by a requirement for the affected insurers to conduct certain stress and scenario testing in order to assess their potential vulnerability to defined extreme events 
where the results of scenario and stress testing indicated potential capital vulnerability  the bma would be able to require a higher solvency cushion by increasing the tcl figure 
in circumstances where an insurer has failed to comply with an ecr given by the bma in respect of that insurer  such insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends until the failure is rectified and the insurer is obliged to i provide the bma  within fourteen days of the failure  with a written report as to why the failure occurred and remedial steps to be taken  and ii within forty five days of the failure to provide the bma with unaudited interim financial statements 
in addition  the unaudited interim financial statements must be accompanied by the opinion of the loss reserve specialist  a general business solvency certificate in respect of the unaudited financials and a csr reflecting an ecr prepared using post failure data 
underlying the risk based solvency capital regime described above is the msm test set out in the insurance returns and solvency amendment regulations as amended 
while it must calculate its ecr annually by reference to either the bscr or an approved internal model  a class insurer such as endurance bermuda must also ensure that  at all times  its ecr is at least equal to the msm for a class insurer in respect of its general business  which is the greater of of net premiums written being gross premiums written less any reinsurance premiums ceded not exceeding of gross premiums written  and of net loss and loss expense provisions and other general business insurance reserves 
the bma has also introduced a three tiered capital system for class insurers designed to assess the quality of capital resources that an insurer has available to meet its capital requirements 
the tiered capital system classifies all capital instruments into one of three tiers based on their loss absorbency characteristics with the highest quality capital classified as tier capital and lesser quality capital classified as either tier capital or tier capital 
only tier and tier capital may be used to support an insurer s msm 
certain percentages of each of tier  and capital maybe used to satisfy an insurer s ecr 
any combination of tier  or capital may be used to meet the tcl 
the rules introduced a regime that requires class insurers to perform an assessment of their own risk and solvency requirements  referred to as a commercial insurer s solvency self assessment cissa 
the cissa will allow the bma to obtain an insurer s view of the capital resources required to achieve its business objectives and to assess the company s governance  risk management and controls surrounding this process 
the rules also introduced a catastrophe risk return which must be filed with the bma  which assesses and insurer s reliance on vender models in assessing catastrophe exposure 

table of contents in addition  under the insurance act  class insurers are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends of more than of its total statutory capital and surplus  as shown on its previous financial year statutory balance sheet  unless at least seven days before payment of the dividends it files with the bma an affidavit that it will continue to meet its required solvency margins 
endurance bermuda as a class insurer must obtain the bma s prior approval before reducing its total statutory capital  as shown on its previous financial year statutory balance sheet  by or more 
furthermore  under the companies act  each of endurance holdings and endurance bermuda may only declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution from contributed surplus  if endurance holdings or endurance bermuda  as the case may be  has no reasonable grounds for believing that it is  or would after the payment be  unable to pay its liabilities as they become due  or if the realizable value of its assets would not be less than its liabilities 
minimum liquidity ratio the insurance act provides a minimum liquidity ratio for general business insurers  like endurance bermuda 
an insurer engaged in general business is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than of the amount of its relevant liabilities

uk regulation general on december   the financial services authority fsa assumed its full powers and responsibilities as the single statutory regulator responsible for regulating the financial services industry in respect of the carrying on of regulated activities including deposit taking  insurance  investment management and most other financial services business by way of business in the uk  with the purpose of maintaining confidence in the uk financial system  providing public understanding of the system  securing the proper degree of protection for consumers and helping to reduce financial crime 
it is a criminal offense for any person to carry on a regulated activity in the uk unless that person is authorized by the fsa and has been granted permission to carry on that regulated activity or falls under an exemption 
insurance business which includes reinsurance business is authorized and supervised by the fsa 
insurance business in the united kingdom is divided between two main categories long term insurance which is primarily investment related and general insurance 
it is not possible for an insurance company to be authorized in both long term and general insurance business 
these two categories are both divided into classes for example permanent health and pension fund management are two classes of long term insurance  damage to property and motor vehicle liability are two classes of general insurance 
under the financial services and markets act the fsma  effecting or carrying out contracts of insurance  within a class of general or long term insurance  by way of business in the united kingdom  constitutes a regulated activity requiring individual authorization 
an authorized insurance company must have permission for each class of insurance business it intends to write 

table of contents endurance uk has received authorization from the fsa to effect and carry out in the united kingdom contracts of insurance in all classes of general business limited in the case of credit and surety to reinsurance only except legal expenses and assistance business 
on january   as a result of the implementation by the united kingdom government of the insurance mediation directive ec various additional activities  which had previously been unregulated  fell within the scope of fsa regulation 
endurance uk has accordingly received authorization from the fsa to conduct the following additional regulated activities arranging bringing about deals in investments and making arrangements with a view to transactions in investments 
in both cases  those activities are restricted to non investment insurance contracts 
endurance uk is also authorized to accept deposits limited to accepting deposits in the course of carrying on insurance business for which it holds permission 
as an authorized insurer in the united kingdom  endurance uk would be able to operate throughout the eu  subject to certain regulatory requirements of the fsa and in some cases  certain local regulatory requirements 
an insurance company with fsa authorization to write insurance business in the united kingdom can seek consent from the fsa to allow it to provide cross border services in other member states of the eu as an alternative  fsa consent may be obtained to establish a branch office within another member state 
as an fsa authorized insurer  the insurance and reinsurance businesses of endurance uk are subject to close supervision by the fsa 
the fsa has implemented specific requirements for senior management arrangements  systems and controls of insurance and reinsurance companies under its jurisdiction  which place a strong emphasis on risk identification and management in relation to the prudential regulation of insurance and reinsurance business in the united kingdom 
in december  the fsa prompted a market initiative in the united kingdom insurance industry to resolve perceived problems resulting from contract uncertainty  which may exist where the full terms and conditions of a contract of insurance or reinsurance are not established at or before the time when the contract comes into force 
the fsa s stated preferred outcome was that a market solution should be produced which met the regulator s main concerns  which were that policyholders should know precisely what protection they have bought  and that insurers  reinsurers and brokers should have a clearer view  at the time of inception of a contract of the relevant legal  fiduciary  operational and underwriting risks to which they are subject 
contract certainty has since continued to be a supervisory priority and most of the insurance industry in the uk signed up to a code of practice to help avoid disputes arising from contract uncertainty 
the fsa has stated that in cases where it believes that firms have fallen behind the rest of the market in reducing the number of contracts that do not meet the market s contract certainty standards  it would consider regulatory action to address this  though no enforcement action has been taken in this regard to date 
this action might include increases in required regulatory capital or the commencement of enforcement action 
in december  the fsa published its new insurance conduct of business sourcebook icobs which sets out the standards of the requirements for general insurance firms on how they deal with their customers 
the new general insurance regime came into effect on january  supervision the fsa carries out the prudential supervision of insurance companies through a variety of methods  including the collection of information from statistical returns  review of accountants reports  visits to insurance companies and regular formal interviews 
the fsa has adopted a risk based approach to the supervision of insurance companies 
under this approach the fsa performs a formal risk assessment of insurance companies or groups carrying on business in the uk periodically  which varies in length according to the risk profile of the insurer 
the fsa performs the risk assessment by analyzing information which it receives during the normal course of its supervision  such as regular prudential returns on the financial position of the insurance company  or which it acquires through a series of meetings with senior management of the insurance company 
after each risk assessment  the fsa will inform the insurer of its views on the insurer s risk profile 
this will include details of any remedial action that the fsa requires and the likely consequences if this action is not taken 
solvency requirements the fsa s general prudential sourcebook and prudential sourcebook for insurers together  the prudential sourcebooks require that insurance companies maintain a margin of solvency at all times in respect of any general insurance undertaken by the insurance company  the calculation of which in any particular case depends on the type and amount of insurance business a company writes 
the method of calculation of the solvency margin is set out in the prudential sourcebooks  and for these purposes  all insurer s assets and liabilities are subject to specific valuation rules which are set out in the prudential sourcebooks 
failure to maintain the required solvency margin is one of the grounds on which wide powers of intervention conferred upon the fsa may be exercised 
for financial years ending on or after january   the calculation of the required margin of solvency has been amended as a result of 
table of contents the implementation of the eu solvency i directives 
in respect of liability business accepted  of the actual premiums written and claims incurred must be included in the calculation  which has had the effect of increasing the required minimum margin of solvency of endurance uk endurance uk continuously monitors its solvency capital position and maintains capital in excess of the required minimum margin of solvency 
each insurance company writing various classes of business is also required by the prudential sourcebooks to maintain equalization provisions calculated in accordance with the provisions of the prudential sourcebook for insurers 
insurers are required to calculate an enhanced capital requirement in addition to their required minimum solvency margin and to report it to the fsa though the enhanced capital requirement is not part of the formal capital requirements under the prudential sourcebooks 
this represents a more risk based calculation than the statutory solvency margin requirements derived from the eu directives 
there is also a requirement for insurers to maintain financial resources which are adequate  both as to amount and quality  to ensure that there is no significant risk that its liabilities cannot be met as they come due 
in order to carry out the assessment as to the necessary financial resources that are required  an insurer is required to identify the major sources of risk to its ability to meet its liabilities as they come due  and to carry out stress and scenario tests to identify an appropriate range of realistic adverse scenarios in which the risk crystallizes and to estimate the financial resources needed in each of the circumstances and events identified 
in addition  the fsa gives individual capital guidance icg regularly to insurers and reinsurers following receipt of individual capital assessments  prepared by firms themselves 
the fsa s guidance may be that a company should hold more or less than its then current level of regulatory capital  or that the company s regulatory capital should remain unaltered 
endurance uk has submitted an individual capital assessment solvency calculation to the fsa and has agreed with the fsa the bases and methodology for this calculation 
this calculation is used along with other tools by the fsa to help establish the icg 
endurance uk is currently calculating the enhanced capital requirement for december  should endurance uk not meet this test  additional capital may be required 
in addition  an insurer other than a pure reinsurer that is part of a group  is required to perform and submit to the fsa a solvency margin calculation return in respect of its ultimate parent undertaking  in accordance with the fsa s rules 
this return is not part of an insurer s own solvency return and hence will not be publicly available 
although there is no requirement for the parent undertaking solvency calculation to show a positive result  the fsa may take action where it considers that the solvency of the insurance company is or may be jeopardized due to the group solvency position 
further  an insurer is required to report in its annual returns to the fsa all material related party transactions eg  intra group reinsurance  whose value is more than of the insurer s general insurance business amount 
the european commission  jointly with member states  is carrying out a fundamental review of the regulatory capital and supervisory regime of the insurance industry the solvency ii project 
its objective is to establish a solvency system that is better matched to the true risks of insurers enabling supervisors to protect policyholders interests as effectively as possible and in accordance with common principles across the eu 
endurance uk is monitoring the ongoing consultation and legislative steps following adoption of the solvency ii framework directive in may which will be amended by a further omnibus directive proposed by the european commission in january  together the solvency ii directive 
the legislation implementing the final version of the solvency ii directive is likely to take effect in the uk and the other uk member states on january   and will replace the current solvency requirements described above 
the fsa is undertaking a program of preparatory work and supervisory visits to insurers  in order to identify the actions which it considers that insurers should now undertake in anticipation of the implementation of the solvency ii directive and to review insurers internal models for calculating all or part of the new solvency capital requirements 
endurance uk is fully co operating with the fsa in this respect 
restrictions on dividend payments uk company law prohibits endurance uk from declaring a dividend to its shareholders unless it has profits available for distribution 
the determination of whether a company has profits available for distribution is based on its accumulated realized profits less its accumulated realized losses 
while the united kingdom insurance regulatory laws impose no statutory restrictions on a general insurer s ability to declare a dividend  the fsa strictly controls the maintenance of each insurance company s solvency margin within its jurisdiction 
the fsa s rules require endurance uk to notify the fsa of any proposed or actual payment of a dividend 
any such payment or proposal could result in regulatory intervention 
in addition  the fsa requires authorized insurance companies to notify the fsa in advance of any significant dividend payment 
reporting requirements uk insurance companies must prepare their financial statements under the companies act of as amended  which requires the filing with companies house of audited financial statements and related reports 
in addition  uk insurance companies are required to file with the fsa regulatory returns  which include a revenue account  a profit and loss account and a balance sheet in prescribed forms 
under the interim prudential sourcebook for insurers  audited regulatory returns must be filed with the fsa within two months and days or three months where the delivery of the return is made electronically 

table of contents supervision of management the fsa closely supervises the management of insurance companies through the approved persons regime  by which any appointment of persons to perform certain specified controlled functions within a regulated entity  must be approved by the fsa 
change of control the financial services and markets act the fsma regulates the acquisition of control of any uk insurance company authorized under the fsma 
any company or individual that together with any person acting in concert with it or him directly or indirectly acquires or more of the shares in a uk authorized insurance company or its parent company  or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of or more of the voting power in such authorized insurance company or its parent company  would be considered to have acquired control for the purposes of the relevant legislation  as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such authorized insurance company or its parent company by virtue of his shareholding or voting power in either 
a purchaser of or more of the ordinary shares would therefore be considered to have acquired control of endurance uk under the fsma as amended by the eu acquisitions directive  any person proposing to acquire control over a uk authorized insurance company must give prior notification to the fsa of his intention to do so together with certain prescribed information 
the fsa then has working days to make a decision following its acknowledgement of the application 
the duration of this period may be stopped by the fsa once  to request further information  for a maximum of days days for non eu applicants 
although the fsa may make further information requests  this does not stop the clock  meaning that the fsa has a maximum of working days to consider an application from an eu applicant for a non eu applicant 
the fsa may only object to a particular acquisition on the basis of certain specified assessment criteria relating to the reputation and financial soundness of the acquirer  the reputation and experience of those who will direct the regulated business  compliance with prudential requirement and any suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing 
in addition to these requirements  the uk insurer itself is obliged to notify the fsa if it is aware of the proposed acquisition  and may be subject to regulatory enforcement action if it fails to do so 
intervention and enforcement the fsa has extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of an authorized person  culminating in the ultimate sanction of the removal of authorization to carry on a regulated activity 
fsma imposes on the fsa statutory obligations to monitor compliance with the requirements imposed by fsma  and to enforce the provisions of fsma related rules made by the fsa 
the fsa has power  among other things  to enforce and take disciplinary measures in respect of breaches of both the prudential sourcebooks and breaches of the conduct of business rules generally applicable to authorized persons 
the fsa also has the power to prosecute criminal offences arising under fsma  and to prosecute insider dealing under part v of the criminal justice act of  and breaches of money laundering regulations 
the fsa s stated policy is to pursue criminal prosecution in all appropriate cases 
passporting european union directives allow endurance uk to conduct business in european union states other than the united kingdom in compliance with the scope of permission granted these companies by the fsa without the necessity of additional licensing or authorization in other european union jurisdictions 
this ability to operate in other jurisdictions of the european union on the basis of home state authorization and supervision is sometimes referred to as passporting 
insurers may operate outside their home member state either on a services basis or on an establishment basis 
operating on a services basis means that the company conducts permitted businesses in the host state without having a physical presence there  while operating on an establishment basis means the company has a branch or physical presence in the host state 
in both cases  a company remains subject to regulation by its home regulator  and not by local regulatory authorities  although the company nonetheless may have to comply with certain local rules reserved to the host state the state into which the services are being provided or in which the branch is being established 
in addition to european union member states  norway  iceland and liechtenstein members of the broader european economic area are jurisdictions in which this passporting framework applies 
elimination of the fsa the uk government is currently consulting on proposals to reform the uk regulatory structure 
this means that  as of the end of  the fsa will cease to exist in its current form and three new regulatory bodies will be established in its place 
endurance uk will be supervised by both the financial conduct authority fca and the prudential regulation authority pra going forward 
the fca will be responsible for regulating the day to day conduct of insurance firms and the pra will have responsibility for monitoring compliance with prudential requirements 
it is proposed that the fca will have a more interventionalist approach to regulation and will be focused on consumer outcomes

much of state insurance regulation follows model statutes or regulations developed or amended by the national association of insurance commissioners naic which is comprised of the insurance commissioners of each us jurisdiction 
the naic re examines and amends existing model laws and regulations including holding company regulations in addition to determining whether new ones are needed 
naic model laws and regulations are merely recommended laws and regulations relating to the regulation of insurance in the us that become effective only when enacted into law or promulgated as a regulation in a state 
some models have been enacted in very few states and some models have been enacted in all states in some form or another 
insurance holding company regulation of endurance holdings endurance holdings and endurance us holdings corp  as parent companies of the company s us operating companies  are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the states of delaware and texas  the states in which the company s us operating subsidiaries are organized and domiciled 
these laws generally require  among other things  the insurance holding company and each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance departments of their respective domiciliary states and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system 
generally  all material transactions among companies in the holding company system involving the company s us operating subsidiaries  including sales  loans  reinsurance agreements  service agreements  dividend payments and certain transactions within the insurance holding company system must be fair and  if material or of a specified category  require prior notice and approval or non disapproval by the insurance regulator of the state in which the involved us operating subsidiary is domiciled 
the naic  as part of its solvency modernization initiative  has engaged in a concerted effort to strengthen the ability of us state insurance regulators to monitor us insurance holding company groups 
the naic s solvency modernization initiative  among other things  aims to expand the authority and focus of state insurance regulators to encompass us insurance holding company systems at the group level 
the holding company reform efforts at the naic culminated in december in the adoption of significant amendments to the naic s insurance holding company system regulatory act the model act and its insurance holding company system model regulation the model regulation 
among other things  the revised model act and model regulation explicitly address enterprise risk the risk that an activity  circumstance  event or series of events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that  if not remedied promptly  is likely to have a material adverse affect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole and require annual reporting of potential enterprise risk as well as access to information to allow the state insurance regulator to assess such risk 
in addition  the naic model act amendments include a requirement to the effect that any person divesting control over an insurer must provide days notice to the regulator and the insurer with an exception for cases where a form a is being filed 
the amendments direct the domestic state insurance regulator to determine those instances in which a divesting person will be required to file for and obtain approval of the transaction 
in june  texas became one of the first states to adopt the principal components of the amended model act 
the related amendments to the texas insurance holding company act depart somewhat from the model act in including a phase in of the enterprise risk annual reporting requirement based on the volume of total direct or assumed annual premiums written by the insurer during the preceding month period 
ultimate controlling persons of insurers with direct written and assumed premiums of more than billion but less than billion during the preceding month period must file their first enterprise risk report with the first annual registration statement that becomes due after january  if the insurance regulator in delaware adopts the revised model act and model regulation  the scope of insurance holding company regulation that the company s holding company system is currently subject to will be significantly expanded 
changes of control before a person can acquire control of a us domestic insurer or reinsurer  prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the insurer or reinsurer is domiciled  or the acquiror must make a disclaimer of control filing with the insurance department of such state and obtain approval thereon 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer or reinsurer  the domiciliary state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the proposed acquiror  the integrity and management of the acquiror s board of directors and executive officers  the acquiror s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control 
generally  state insurance statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds with the power to vote  or holds proxies representing  ten percent or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer 
because a person acquiring ten percent or more of endurance 
table of contents holdings ordinary shares would indirectly acquire the same percentage of common stock of endurance holdings us operating subsidiaries  the us insurance change of control laws will likely apply to such a transaction 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of endurance holdings  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of the shareholders of endurance holdings might consider to be desirable 
the model act amendments adopted by texas alter the method by which a person can disclaim control over an insurer where a presumption of control exists 
historically under the naic model act  a disclaimer of control was considered effective when filed  no affirmative approval from the state insurance regulator was required  and the regulator could disapprove a disclaimer only upon a notice and hearing 
under the amendments to the model act adopted in texas  a disclaimer is deemed effective after days unless disallowed prior to that time  and disallowance does not require a notice or hearing 
the texas amendments expressly provide  however  that the texas commissioner of insurance the texas commissioner may disallow a disclaimer at any time if the texas commissioner determines that the disclaimer is incomplete or inaccurate or is no longer accurate 
under the amendments to the texas insurance holding company act  a divesting person must have the divestiture approved by the texas commissioner 
unlike the naic model act amendments  which require the confidential notice of proposed divestiture at least days prior to the cessation of control  the texas amendments require a divesting person to file a notice of its proposed divestiture with the texas commissioner at least days before the cessation of control 
in considering whether to approve or deny the divestiture  the texas commissioner shall consider whether it may jeopardize financial stability of the insurer or prejudice the interest of the insurer s policyholders or other claimants 
state insurance regulation of the company s us operating subsidiaries state insurance authorities have broad regulatory powers with respect to various aspects of the business of the company s us operating subsidiaries including licensing to transact business  admittance of assets to statutory surplus  regulating unfair trade and claims practices  establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards including risk based capital standards  establishing credit for reinsurance requirements  approval of policy forms and dates  and regulating investments  dividends and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates 
with respect to direct insurance business  states may also regulate rates and forms used by insurers admitted to transact business within a given state jurisdiction and the marketplace conduct of such insurers 
with respect to reinsurance  other than bulk reinsurance arrangements  the terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements between unaffiliated parties generally are not subject to regulation by any us state insurance department with respect to rates or policy terms 
state insurance laws and regulations require each of the company s us operating subsidiaries to file financial statements with insurance departments everywhere it is licensed  authorized or accredited to conduct insurance business  and the operations of the company s us operating subsidiaries are subject to examination by those departments at any time 
the company s us operating subsidiaries prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the books and records  financial reporting  policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled or authorized to transact business in their states  generally once every three to five years 
examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the naic 
state and federal insurance and securities regulatory authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general also occasionally make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations regarding the compliance of our companies  as well as other companies in our industry  with insurance  securities and other laws 
in general  such state regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders 
under delaware and texas insurance laws  the company s us operating subsidiaries may only pay dividends to their respective parent companies out of earned surplus 
in delaware and texas  earned surplus is defined as an amount equal to the unassigned funds of an insurer as set forth in the most recent annual statement of the insurer submitted to the applicable state insurance regulator  including all or part of the surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets 
in addition  the ability of the company s us operating subsidiaries to declare or pay any dividend  together with all dividends declared or distributed by it within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of ten percent of its policyholders surplus as of the st day of december of the preceding year  or the statutory net income  not including realized capital gains for the month period ending  for the preceding calendar year the st day of december next preceding will be subject to the prior approval of the applicable domestic state insurance regulator 
any dividend paid by any one of the company s us operating subsidiaries must first be paid to its parent company 
if the parent company is also an insurer  as is the case with endurance american  endurance american specialty and endurance risk solutions  the parent company or companies must also meet their own dividend eligibility requirements set forth above in order to pass along any dividends received from subsidiary insurance companies 

table of contents the dividend limitations imposed by delaware and texas insurance laws are based on the statutory financial results of the company s us operating subsidiaries determined by using statutory accounting practices which differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap 
the significant differences relate to deferred acquisition expenses  deferred income taxes  required investment reserves  reserve calculation assumptions and surplus notes 
at december   of the company s us operating subsidiaries  only armtech had earned surplus  and therefore  only armtech could declare or distribute dividends in without prior regulatory approval 
the us federal government s oversight of the insurance industry was expanded under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer act the dodd frank act 
prior to the enactment of the dodd frank act in july  the us federal government s regulation of the insurance industry was essentially limited to certain insurance products  such as flood insurance  multi peril crop insurance and reinsurance of losses from terrorism 
as part of the overall federal financial regulatory reform package contained in the dodd frank act  congress has legislated reforms in the reinsurance and surplus lines sectors 
under reinsurance credit rules established under the dodd frank act  a us ceding insurer need not satisfy the reinsurance credit rules of any nondomestic state if the following two conditions are met the ceding insurer s domestic state is naic accredited  and the ceding insurer s domestic state recognizes credit for reinsurance for its ceded risk 
the dodd frank act also created a federal insurance office fio in the us department of the treasury 
the fio will have the authority to gather information  to advise the treasury secretary on key issues such as terrorism risk coverage and insurance accounting rules  and to send reports to congress 
the fio director will serve as a nonvoting member of the financial stability oversight council 
in addition  the fio will have the ability to recommend to the financial stability oversight council the designation of an insurer as systemically significant and therefore subject to regulation by the federal reserve as a bank holding company 
in limited circumstances  the fio can declare a state insurance law or regulation preempted  but this can be done only after extensive consultation with state insurance regulators  the federal office of trade representative and key insurance industry players in trade associations representing insurers and intermediaries 
risk based capital regulations the insurance laws of delaware and texas require that insurers report their risk based capital rbc based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset  premium and reserve items 
the formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer  including asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk 
the state insurance departments of delaware and texas use the formula only as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possibly inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action  and not as a means to rank insurers generally 
insurance laws impose broad confidentiality requirements on those engaged in the insurance business including insurers  agents  brokers and others and on the state insurance departments as to the use and publication of rbc data 
the insurance departments of delaware and texas have explicit regulatory authority to require various actions by  or take various actions against  insurers whose total adjusted capital does not exceed certain rbc levels 
statutory accounting practices statutory accounting practices  or sap  are a basis of accounting developed to assist us insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies 
it is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer s surplus to policyholders 
accordingly  statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer s domiciliary state 
us gaap concerns an insurer s solvency  but it also concerns other financial measurements  such as income and cash flows 
accordingly  us gaap gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management s stewardship of assets than does sap 
as a direct result  different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap as opposed to sap 
statutory accounting practices established by the naic and adopted  in part  by the delaware and texas insurance regulators  determine  among other things  the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of endurance holdings us insurance company subsidiaries and thus determine  in part  the amount of funds they have available to pay dividends to their respective parent companies 
operations of endurance uk and endurance bermuda endurance uk and endurance bermuda are not admitted to do business in any state in the united states 
insurance laws of each state of the united states and of many other countries restrict or prohibit the sale of insurance and reinsurance within their jurisdictions by non admitted alien insurers and reinsurers such as endurance uk and endurance bermuda 

table of contents in addition to the regulatory requirements imposed by the jurisdictions in which they are licensed  reinsurers business operations are affected by regulatory requirements in various states of the united states governing credit for reinsurance which are imposed on their ceding companies 
in general  a ceding company that obtains reinsurance from a reinsurer that is licensed  accredited or approved by the jurisdiction or state in which the reinsurer files statutory financial statements is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the liability for unearned premiums which are that portion of written premiums which applies to the remaining portion of the policy period and loss reserves and loss expense reserves ceded to the reinsurer 
as stated above  endurance uk and endurance bermuda are not licensed  accredited or approved in any state in the united states 
the great majority of states  however  permit a credit to statutory surplus resulting from reinsurance obtained from a non licensed or non accredited reinsurer to be offset to the extent that the reinsurer provides a letter of credit or other acceptable security arrangement 
a few states do not allow credit for reinsurance ceded to non licensed or non accredited reinsurers except in certain limited circumstances and others impose additional requirements that make it difficult to become accredited 
we do not believe that endurance uk and endurance bermuda are in violation of insurance laws of any jurisdiction in the united states 
there can be no assurance however  that inquiries or challenges to endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s insurance or reinsurance activities will not be raised in the future 
switzerland in  endurance bermuda established a branch in zurich  switzerland named endurance specialty insurance ltd 
pembroke bermuda zurich branch 
swiss law does not impose additional regulation upon a swiss branch of a foreign reinsurer

material tax considerations certain bermuda tax considerations currently  there is no bermuda income  corporation or profits tax  withholding tax  capital gains tax  capital transfer tax  estate duty or inheritance tax payable by us or our shareholders  other than shareholders ordinarily resident in bermuda  if any 
currently  there is no bermuda withholding or other tax on principal  interest or dividends paid to holders of the ordinary shares or preferred shares  other than holders ordinarily resident in bermuda  if any 
there can be no assurance that we or our shareholders will not be subject to any such tax in the future 
endurance bermuda has received written assurance dated may  and endurance holdings has received written assurance dated may  from the minister of finance under the exempted undertakings tax protection act of bermuda  as amended  that if there is enacted in bermuda any legislation imposing tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition of that tax would not be applicable to endurance bermuda or endurance holdings or to any of their respective operations  shares  debentures or obligations until march   provided  that the assurance is subject to the condition that it will not be construed to prevent the application of such tax to people ordinarily resident in bermuda  or to prevent the application of any taxes payable by endurance bermuda or endurance holdings in respect of real property or leasehold interests in bermuda held by them 
it is possible that after march  we may be subject to bermuda taxes 
certain united kingdom tax considerations endurance uk is a company incorporated under the laws of england and is resident in the united kingdom for united kingdom corporation tax purposes 
endurance uk is subject to united kingdom corporation tax on its worldwide profits  subject to the availability of applicable exemptions 
the current rate of united kingdom corporation tax on profits of whatever description is  reducing by annually to a rate of as of april  currently  no united kingdom withholding tax applies to dividends paid by endurance uk united kingdom withholding tax may apply to certain payments of interest by endurance uk up to a rate of 

table of contents certain united states federal income tax considerations the following discussion is a summary of certain us federal income tax considerations relating to endurance holdings and its operating subsidiaries in bermuda  the united states and the united kingdom and the ownership of our ordinary shares and preferred shares 
this summary is based upon the code  the regulations promulgated thereunder  rulings and other administrative pronouncements issued by the irs  judicial decisions  the tax convention between the united states and bermuda the bermuda tax convention and the tax treaty between the united states and the united kingdom the uk treaty  all as currently in effect  and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change  possibly with retroactive effect 
no assurance can be given that the irs would assert  or that a court would not sustain a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below 
no advance ruling has been or will be sought from the irs regarding any matter discussed in this annual report on form k 
this summary is for general information only  and does not purport to discuss all aspects of us federal income taxation that may be important to a particular investor in light of such investor s investment or tax circumstances  or to investors subject to special tax rules  such as tax exempt organizations  dealers in securities  banks  insurance companies  persons that hold ordinary shares or preferred shares that are a hedge or that are hedged against interest rate or insurance risks or that are part of a straddle or conversion transaction  or persons whose functional currency is not the us dollar 
this summary assumes that an investor will hold our ordinary shares and preferred shares as capital assets  which generally means as property held for investment 
investors should consult their tax advisors concerning the consequences  in their particular circumstances  of the ownership of ordinary shares and preferred shares under us federal  state  local and other tax laws 
for us federal income tax purposes and for purposes of the following discussion  a us person means i an individual citizen or resident of the united states  ii a corporation  or other entity treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes  or a partnership  or other entity treated as a partnership for u 
s federal income tax purposes  in each case created or organized in the united states or under the laws of the united states or of any of its political subdivisions  iii an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income tax without regard to its source or iv a trust if either a a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or b the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a us person for us federal income tax purposes 
a us person is a nonresident alien individual  or a corporation  estate or trust that is not a us person 
if a partnership owns ordinary shares or preferred shares  the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership 
if you are a partner of a partnership that owns ordinary shares or preferred shares  you should consult your tax advisor 
united states taxation of endurance holdings and its operating subsidiaries our intent has been and continues to be to operate endurance holdings and its non us subsidiaries in such a manner that they will not be considered to be conducting business within the united states for purposes of us federal income taxation 
whether business is being conducted in the united states is an inherently factual determination 
because the code  regulations and court decisions fail to identify definitively activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the united states  there can be no assurance that the irs will not contend successfully that endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and or endurance uk are or will be engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
a foreign corporation deemed to be so engaged would be subject to us federal income tax at a current maximum rate of  as well as a branch profits tax in certain circumstances  on its income which is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business unless the corporation is entitled to relief under the permanent establishment provision of an applicable tax treaty  as discussed below 
such income tax  if imposed  would be based on effectively connected income computed in a manner generally analogous to that applied to the income of a us corporation  except that a foreign corporation is entitled to deductions and credits only if it timely files a us federal income tax return 
endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and endurance uk have in the past and intend to continue to file protective us federal income tax returns on a timely basis in order to preserve the right to claim income tax deductions and credits if it is ever determined that they are subject to us federal income tax 
if endurance bermuda is entitled to the benefits under the bermuda tax convention  it will not be subject to us federal income tax on any income found to be effectively connected with a us trade or business unless that trade or business is conducted through a permanent establishment in the united states 
whether business is being conducted in the united states through a permanent establishment is an inherently factual determination 
endurance bermuda intends to conduct its activities so as not to have a permanent establishment in the united states  although there can be no assurance that it will achieve this result 
an insurance enterprise resident in bermuda generally will be entitled to the benefits of the bermuda tax convention if i more than of its shares are owned beneficially  directly or indirectly  by individual residents of the united states or bermuda or us citizens and ii its income is not used in substantial part  directly or indirectly  to make disproportionate distributions to  or to meet certain liabilities of  persons who are neither residents of either the united states or bermuda nor us citizens 

table of contents foreign insurance companies that conduct an insurance business within the united states must maintain a certain minimum amount of effectively connected net investment income  determined in accordance with a formula that depends  in part  on the amount of us risk insured or reinsured by such companies 
if endurance bermuda is considered to be engaged in the conduct of an insurance business in the united states and it is not entitled to the benefits of the bermuda tax convention  either because it fails to satisfy one of the limitations on bermuda tax convention benefits described above or because endurance bermuda is considered to have a us permanent establishment  a significant portion of endurance bermuda s premium and investment income could be subject to us federal income tax 
in addition  while the bermuda tax convention clearly applies to premium income  it is not clear whether it applies to other income  such as investment income 
consequently  if endurance bermuda is considered to be engaged in the conduct of an insurance business in the united states and is entitled to the benefits of the bermuda tax convention  but the bermuda tax convention is interpreted so as not to apply to investment income  a significant portion of endurance bermuda s investment income could be subject to us federal income tax even if endurance bermuda does not maintain a permanent establishment in the united states 
under the uk treaty  endurance uk  if entitled to the benefits of the uk treaty  will not be subject to uk federal income tax on any income found to be effectively connected with a us trade or business unless that trade or business is conducted through a permanent establishment in the united states 
endurance uk intends to continue to conduct its activities in a manner so that it does not have a permanent establishment in the united states  although we cannot predict whether we will achieve this result 
endurance uk will be entitled to the benefits of the uk treaty if i during at least half of the days in the relevant taxable period  at least of endurance uk s stock is beneficially owned  directly or indirectly  by citizens or residents of the united states and the united kingdom  and less than of endurance uk s gross income for the relevant taxable period is paid or accrued  directly or indirectly  to persons who are not us or uk residents in the form of payments that are deductible for purposes of uk taxation or ii with respect to specific items of income  profit or gain derived from the united states  if such income  profit or gain is considered to be derived in connection with  or incidental to  endurance uk s business conducted in the united kingdom 
foreign corporations not engaged in a trade or business in the united states are nonetheless subject to us withholding tax at a rate of of the gross amount of certain fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains  profits and income derived from sources within the united states such as dividends and certain interest on investments  subject to reduction by applicable treaties 
the united states also imposes an excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premiums paid to foreign insurers or reinsurers with respect to risks located in the united states 
the rate of tax applicable to premiums paid to endurance bermuda is for non life insurance premiums and for reinsurance premiums 
the excise tax will not apply to premiums paid to endurance uk if endurance uk is entitled to the benefits of the uk treaty  and certain other requirements are met 
endurance us reinsurance  endurance american  endurance american specialty and endurance risk solutions are delaware corporations and armtech is a texas corporation 
each will be subject to taxation in the united states at regular corporate rates 
dividends paid by endurance us holdings corp 
to endurance bermuda will be subject to us withholding tax at the rate of 
united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and preferred shares shareholders who are us persons dividends 
distributions with respect to ordinary shares and preferred shares including the payment of additional amounts  in the case of the preferred shares will be treated as ordinary dividend income to the extent of endurance holdings current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes  subject to the discussion below relating to the potential application of the controlled foreign corporation cfc  related person insurance income rpii and passive foreign investment company pfic rules 
these dividends should constitute qualified dividend income as defined in section h b of the code and  thus  should be entitled to the preferential federal income tax rate applicable to qualified dividends received before january  by certain shareholders such as individuals  provided that certain holding period requirements are satisfied and certain other conditions are met  and provided further that we are not considered a passive foreign investment company 
this preferential tax rate is subject to increase for dividends paid after such date 
dividends with respect to endurance holdings ordinary shares and preferred shares will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to us corporations under the code 
the amount of any distribution that exceeds endurance holdings current and accumulated earnings and profits first will be treated as a tax free return of capital  reducing a holder s tax basis in the ordinary shares or preferred shares with regard to which the distribution was made and any amount in excess of such tax basis will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such holder s shares 
classification of endurance holdings  endurance uk or endurance bermuda as a cfc 
each us shareholder of a foreign corporation that is a cfc for an uninterrupted period of days or more during a taxable year  and who owns shares in the cfc directly or indirectly through foreign entities  in such corporation on the last day  in such year  in which such corporation is a cfc must include in its gross income for us federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income  even if 
table of contents the subpart f income is not distributed 
a foreign corporation is considered a cfc if us shareholders own directly  indirectly through foreign entities or constructively pursuant to the application of certain constructive ownership rules more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of such foreign corporation  or the total value of all stock of such corporation 
for purposes of taking into account insurance income  a cfc also includes a foreign corporation in which more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock or more than of the total value of the stock is owned directly  indirectly through foreign entities or constructively pursuant to the application of certain constructive ownership rules by us shareholders  on any day during the taxable year of such corporation  if the gross amount of premiums or other consideration for the reinsurance or the issuing of insurance contracts exceeds of the gross amount of all premiums or other consideration in respect of all risks 
a us shareholder is a us person who owns at least of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the foreign corporation 
the preferred shares should not be considered voting stock for purposes of determining whether a us person would be a us shareholder unless and until there exists a nonpayment event which triggers the preferred shareholders right to elect two additional directors to the board of directors of endurance holdings 
in such case  the preferred shares should be treated as voting stock for as long as such right continues 
due to the anticipated dispersion of endurance holdings share ownership among holders  its bye law provisions that impose limitations on the concentration of voting power of any shares that are entitled to vote and authorize the board of directors of endurance holdings to repurchase such shares under certain circumstances and other factors  no us person that owns shares in endurance holdings directly or indirectly through foreign entities should be subject to treatment as a us shareholder of a cfc 
there can be no assurance  however  that the irs will not challenge the effectiveness of these bye law provisions for purposes of preventing us shareholder status and that a court will not sustain such challenge 
rpii companies 
the cfc rules also apply to certain insurance companies that earn related person insurance income rpii 
if the rpii rules were to apply to endurance uk or endurance bermuda  a uk person who owns ordinary shares or preferred shares of endurance holdings  directly or indirectly through foreign entities on the last day of the company s taxable year would be required to include in its gross income for us federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s rpii for the entire taxable year  regardless of whether such rpii is distributed 
for purposes of the rpii rules  endurance uk or endurance bermuda will be treated as a cfc if rpii shareholders collectively own directly  indirectly through foreign entities or by application of the constructive ownership rules or more of the stock of endurance uk or endurance bermuda by vote or value 
rpii is defined as any insurance income attributable to policies of insurance or reinsurance with respect to which the person directly or indirectly insured is a rpii shareholder of the foreign corporation or a related person to such rpii shareholder 
in general  and subject to certain limitations  insurance income is income including premium and investment income attributable to the issuing of any insurance or reinsurance contract which would be taxed under the portions of the code relating to insurance companies if the income were the income of a domestic insurance company 
a rpii shareholder is any us person who owns  directly or indirectly through foreign entities  any amount rather than stock possessing or more of the total combined voting power of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s stock  and related person means someone who controls or is controlled by the rpii shareholder or someone who is controlled by the same person or persons which control the rpii shareholder 
control is measured by either more than in value or more than in voting power of stock  applying constructive ownership principles 
a corporation s pension plan is ordinarily not a related person with respect to the corporation unless the pension plan owns  directly or indirectly through the application of constructive ownership rules  more than  measured by vote or value  of the stock of the corporation 
rpii exceptions 
the special rpii rules do not apply if i direct or indirect insureds and persons related to such insureds  whether or not us persons  own  directly or indirectly  less than of the voting power and less than of the value of the stock of endurance uk or endurance bermuda  as applicable the ownership exception  ii rpii  determined on a gross basis  is less than of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s gross insurance income for the taxable year  as applicable the gross income exception  iii endurance uk or endurance bermuda elects to be taxed on its rpii as if the rpii were effectively connected with the conduct of a us trade or business and to waive all treaty benefits with respect to rpii and meets certain other requirements or iv endurance uk or endurance bermuda elects to be treated as a us corporation 
endurance bermuda and endurance uk intend to operate in a manner that is intended to ensure that each qualifies for the gross income exception 
it is possible that neither endurance bermuda nor endurance uk will be successful in qualifying under this exception 
if none of these exceptions applies  each us person who directly or indirectly through foreign entities owns shares in endurance holdings and therefore  indirectly in endurance uk and endurance bermuda on the last day of endurance holdings taxable year  will be required to include in its gross income for us federal income tax purposes its share of rpii of endurance uk and or endurance bermuda  as applicable  for the entire taxable year 
this inclusion will be determined as if such rpii were distributed proportionately only to such us persons holding shares in endurance holdings at that date 
the inclusion will be limited to the current year earnings and profits of endurance uk or endurance bermuda  as applicable  reduced by the shareholder s pro rata share  if any  of certain prior year deficits in earnings and profits 

table of contents basis adjustments 
a rpii shareholder s tax basis in its endurance holdings ordinary shares or preferred shares  as the case may be  will be increased by the amount of any rpii or other subpart f income that the shareholder includes in income 
any distributions made by endurance holdings out of previously taxed rpii or other subpart f income will be exempt from further tax in the hands of the rpii shareholder 
the rpii shareholder s tax basis in its endurance holdings shares will be reduced by the amount of any distributions that are excluded from income under this rule 
uncertainty as to application of rpii 
regulations interpreting the rpii provisions of the code exist only in proposed form 
it is not certain whether these regulations will be adopted in their proposed form or what changes might ultimately be made or whether any such changes  as well as any interpretation or application of the rpii rules by the irs  the courts or otherwise  might have retroactive effect 
accordingly  the meaning of the rpii provisions and their application to endurance uk and endurance bermuda is uncertain 
these provisions include the grant of authority to the us treasury to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection  including regulations preventing the avoidance of this subsection through cross insurance arrangements or otherwise 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge any determinations by endurance uk or endurance bermuda as to the amount  if any  of rpii that should be includible in income or that the amounts of the rpii inclusions will not be subject to adjustment based upon subsequent irs examination 
prospective investors should consult their tax advisors as to the effects of these uncertainties 
information reporting 
under certain circumstances  us persons owning stock in a foreign corporation are required to file irs form with their us federal income tax returns 
generally  information reporting on irs form is required with respect to i a person who is treated as a rpii shareholder  ii a us shareholder of a foreign corporation that is a cfc for an uninterrupted period of days or more during any tax year of the foreign corporation  and who owned the stock on the last of that year and iii under certain circumstances  a us person who acquires stock in a foreign corporation  and as a result thereof owns or more of the voting power or value of such foreign corporation  whether or not such foreign corporation is a cfc 
for any taxable year in which endurance holdings determines that gross rpii constitutes or more of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s gross insurance income and the ownership exception does not apply  endurance holdings intends to mail to all us persons registered as holders of its ordinary shares and preferred shares irs form  completed with information from endurance holdings  for attachment to the us federal income tax returns of such shareholders 
a tax exempt organization that is treated as a us shareholder or a rpii shareholder also must file irs form in the circumstances described above 
failure to file irs form may result in penalties 
tax exempt shareholders 
tax exempt entities will be required to treat certain subpart f insurance income  including rpii that is includible in income by the tax exempt entity as unrelated business taxable income 
dispositions of ordinary shares and preferred shares 
subject to the discussion below relating to the redemption of preferred shares or the potential application of code section or the pfic rules  any gain or loss realized by a us person on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or preferred shares will be subject to us federal income taxation as capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized upon such sale or exchange and such person s tax basis in the shares 
if the holding period for these shares exceeds one year at the time of the disposition  any gain will be subject to tax at a current maximum marginal tax rate of for individuals subject to increase in without any congressional action and for corporations 
moreover  gain  if any  generally will be us source gain and generally will constitute passive income for foreign tax credit limitation purposes 
code section provides that if a us person sells or exchanges stock in a foreign corporation and such person owned directly  indirectly through certain foreign entities or constructively or more of the voting power of the corporation at any time during the five year period ending on the date of disposition when the corporation was a cfc  any gain from the sale or exchange of the shares will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the cfc s earnings and profits determined under us federal income tax principles during the period that the shareholder held the shares and while the corporation was a cfc with certain adjustments 
a us shareholder may in certain circumstances be required to report a disposition of shares of a cfc by attaching irs form to the us federal income tax or information return that it would normally file for the taxable year in which the disposition occurs 
for these purposes  the preferred shares should not be considered as having voting power unless and until there exists a nonpayment event which triggers the right of holders of preferred shares to elect two additional directors to the board of directors of endurance holdings 
in such case  the preferred shares should be treated as voting stock for as long as such right continues 
code section also applies to the sale or exchange of shares in a foreign corporation if the foreign corporation would be treated as a cfc for rpii purposes and would be taxed as an insurance company if it were a domestic corporation  regardless of whether the shareholder is a us shareholder or whether the gross income exception or the ownership exception applies 
regulations do not specifically address whether or how code section would apply to dispositions of shares of stock in a foreign corporation that is not a cfc and does not directly engage in the insurance business  but has a subsidiary that is a cfc and that would be taxed as an insurance company if it were a domestic corporation 
endurance holdings believes  however  that the application of code section under the rpii rules should not apply to the disposition of ordinary shares or preferred shares because endurance holdings is not directly engaged in the insurance business 
there can be no assurance  however  that the irs will 
table of contents not interpret the regulations in a contrary manner or that the us treasury department will not amend the regulations to provide that these rules will apply to dispositions of our ordinary shares and preferred shares 
prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the effects of these rules on a disposition of our shares 
redemption of preferred shares 
subject to the discussion herein relating to the application of the rpii and pfic rules  under section of the code  a redemption of the preferred shares will be treated as a dividend to the extent of endurance holdings current and accumulated earnings and profits  unless such redemption satisfies the tests set forth under section b of the code  which would treat the redemption as a sale or exchange subject to taxation as described above under dispositions of ordinary shares and preferred shares 
a redemption will be treated as a sale or exchange if i it is substantially disproportionate  ii constitutes a complete termination of the holder s stock interest in us  or iii is not essentially equivalent to a dividend  each within the meaning of section b of the code 
in determining whether any of these tests are satisfied  shares considered to be owned by a us person by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in the code  as well as shares actually owned  must generally be taken into account 
because the determination as to whether any of the alternative tests of section b of the code is satisfied with respect to a particular holder of the preferred shares will depend on the facts and circumstances as of the time the determination is made  us shareholders should consult their tax advisors  at such time  to determine their tax treatment in light of their particular circumstances 
passive foreign investment companies 
in general  a foreign corporation will be a pfic during a given year if i or more of its gross income constitutes passive income or ii or more of its assets produce passive income 
for purposes of the pfic determination  passive income generally includes interest  dividends  annuities and other investment income 
the pfic statutory provisions  however  contain an express exception for income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business by a corporation which is predominantly engaged in an insurance business 
this exception is intended to ensure that income derived by a bona fide insurance company is not treated as passive income  except to the extent such income is attributable to financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of the insurance business 
endurance holdings expects for purposes of the pfic rules that each of endurance uk and endurance bermuda will be predominantly engaged in an insurance business and is unlikely to have financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of its insurance business 
accordingly  neither expects to be treated as a pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
there can be no assurances  however  that this will be the case 
the pfic statutory provisions contain a look through rule stating that  for purposes of determining whether a foreign corporation is a pfic  such foreign corporation shall be treated as if it received directly its proportionate share of the income and as if it held its proportionate share of the assets of any other corporation in which it owns at least by value of the shares 
while no explicit guidance is provided by the statutory language  under this look through rule endurance holdings should be deemed to own the assets and to have received the income of its insurance subsidiaries directly for purposes of determining whether it qualifies for the insurance exception 
consequently  endurance holdings does not expect to be treated as a pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
this interpretation of the look through rule is consistent with the legislative intention generally to exclude bona fide insurance companies from the application of pfic provision 
nevertheless  there are currently no treasury regulations regarding the application of the pfic provisions to an insurance company  and new treasury regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be forthcoming 
in addition  the determination of pfic status is fundamentally factual in nature  depends on the application of complex us federal income tax rules that are subject to differing interpretations  and generally cannot be determined until the close of the taxable year in question 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge this position or that a court will not sustain such challenge 
prospective investors should consult their tax advisor as to the effects of the pfic rules 
if endurance holdings were characterized as a pfic during a given year  us persons owning ordinary shares or preferred shares would be subject to a penalty tax at the time of the sale at a gain of  or receipt of an excess distribution with respect to  their shares  unless such shareholders made a qualified electing fund election or mark to market election 
it is uncertain that endurance holdings would be able to provide its shareholders with the information necessary for a us person to make the elections 
in general  a shareholder receives an excess distribution if the amount of the distribution is more than of the average distribution with respect to the shares during the three preceding taxable years or shorter period during which the taxpayer held the shares 
in general  the penalty tax is equivalent to an interest charge on taxes that are deemed due during the period the shareholder owned the shares  computed by assuming that the excess distribution or gain in the case of a sale with respect to the shares was taxed in equal portions at the highest applicable tax rate on ordinary income throughout the shareholder s period of ownership 
the interest charge is equal to the applicable rate imposed on underpayments of us federal income tax for such period 
other 
except as discussed below with respect to backup withholding  dividends paid by endurance holdings will not be subject to us withholding tax 
information reporting and backup withholding 
information returns may be filed with the irs in connection with payments of dividends with respect to our ordinary shares or preferred shares and the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the shares unless the shareholder establishes an exemption from the information reporting rules 
a us person holding our ordinary shares or preferred shares that does not establish such an exemption may be subject to us backup withholding tax on these payments if the 
table of contents holder fails to provide its taxpayer identification number or otherwise comply with the backup withholding rules 
the amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a us person will be allowed as a credit against the us person s us federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund  provided that the required information is furnished to the irs 
shareholders who are non us persons dividends  sales  exchanges and other disposition 
in general and subject to the discussion below under information reporting and backup withholding  a non us person will not be subject to non us federal income or withholding tax with respect to payments of dividends on  or gain upon the disposition of  our ordinary shares or preferred shares unless i the dividends or gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the non us person of a trade or business in the united states or ii in the case of gain upon the disposition of shares  the non us person is an individual who is present in the united states for days or more in the taxable year and certain other conditions are met 
nonresident alien individuals will not be subject to us estate tax with respect to our ordinary shares or preferred shares 
dividends or gain that is effectively connected with the conduct by a non us person of a trade or business in the united states and  if required by an applicable income tax treaty  is attributable to a permanent establishment that a shareholder maintains in the united states generally will be subject to regular us federal income tax in the same manner as if it were realized by a us person 
in addition  if such non us 
person is a non us corporation  such dividends or gain may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of or such lower rate as is provided by an applicable income tax treaty 
information reporting and backup withholding 
if our ordinary shares or preferred shares are held by a non us person through a non us and non us related broker or financial institution  information reporting and backup withholding generally would not be required 
information reporting  and possibly backup withholding  may apply if the shares are held by a non us person through a non us or non us related broker or financial institution and the non us person fails to provide appropriate information 
non us persons should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules

underwriting risks as a property  agriculture and catastrophe insurer and reinsurer  we are particularly vulnerable to losses from catastrophes 
our property  agriculture and catastrophe insurance and reinsurance lines expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes 
catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events  including earthquakes  hurricanes  hailstorms  droughts  severe weather  floods  fires  tornadoes  volcano eruptions  explosions and other natural or man made disasters 
many scientists believe that the earth s atmospheric and oceanic temperatures are increasing and that  in recent years  changing climate conditions have increased the unpredictability  severity and frequency of natural disasters in certain parts of the world 

table of contents the global geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for natural events occurring in a number of areas throughout the world  including  but not limited to  windstorms in the united kingdom and continental europe  hurricanes in florida  the gulf coast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states  typhoons and earthquakes in japan  new zealand  australia and other parts of southeast asia  earthquakes in california and the pacific northwest and new madrid region of the united states and drought  hail  tornado and flooding in the midwestern united states 
from time to time  we may have greater exposures in one or more of these geographic areas than our overall share of the worldwide market might suggest 
accordingly  when and if catastrophes occur in these areas  we may experience relatively more severe negative results from such events than our competitors 
in particular  the company has historically had a relatively large percentage of its coverage exposures concentrated in the states of texas  california and florida  continental europe  and japan 
in addition  changing climate conditions  primarily rising global temperatures  may be increasing  or may in the future increase the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes  including weather events  and may create new types of catastrophe losses 
we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future 
in the event that we experience catastrophe losses  there is a possibility that our premiums will be inadequate to cover these risks 
in addition  because accounting regulations do not permit insurers and reinsurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur  claims from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the estimation of reserves related to catastrophic events can be affected by the inability to access portions of the affected areas  the complexity of factors contributing to the losses  legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves 
complex factors include but are not limited to determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind  evaluating general liability and pollution exposures  estimating additional living expenses  the impact of demand surge  infrastructure disruption  fraud  the effect of mold damage  business interruption costs  and reinsurance collectability 
the timing of a catastrophe s occurrence  such as at or near the end of a reporting period  can also affect the information available to us in estimating reserves for that reporting period 
the estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge and additional information becomes available 
our ability to write new business also could be adversely impacted 
although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events through the use of underwriting controls and the purchase of third party reinsurance  catastrophic events are inherently unpredictable and the actual nature of such events when they occur could be more frequent or severe than contemplated in our pricing and risk management expectations 
as a result  the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
as a property and casualty insurer and reinsurer  we could face losses from war  terrorism and political unrest 
we may have substantial exposure to losses resulting from acts of war  acts of terrorism and political instability 
these risks are inherently unpredictable  although recent events may lead to increased frequency and severity 
it is difficult to predict their occurrence with statistical certainty or to estimate the amount of loss an occurrence will generate 
accordingly  it is possible that our loss reserves will be inadequate to cover these risks 
we closely monitor the amount and types of coverage we provide for terrorism risk under insurance policies and reinsurance treaties 
we often seek to exclude terrorism when we cannot reasonably evaluate the risk of loss or charge an appropriate premium for such risk 
even in cases where we have deliberately sought to exclude coverage  we may not be able to eliminate our exposure to terrorist acts  and thus it is possible that these acts will have a material adverse effect on us 
the risks associated with property and casualty reinsurance underwriting could adversely affect us 
because we participate in property and casualty reinsurance markets  the success of our underwriting efforts depends  in part  upon the policies  procedures and expertise of the ceding companies making the original underwriting decisions 
we face the risk that these ceding companies may fail to accurately assess the risks that they assume initially  which  in turn  may lead us to inaccurately assess the risks we assume 
if we fail to establish and receive appropriate premium rates  we could face significant losses on these contracts 
the terms of the federal multi peril crop insurance program may change and adversely impact us 
we are one of companies that currently participate in the us federal multi peril crop insurance program mpci sponsored by the risk management agency of the us department of agriculture the rma 
as a result of our acquisition of armtech in december of  crop insurance premiums  which are primarily driven by mpci  have become an increasingly larger portion of our business  totaling million of gross premiums written in  and representing of the total gross premiums written in our insurance segment in the rma periodically reviews and proposes changes to the standard reinsurance agreement sra used in connection with the mpci program and such changes to the sra could adversely affect the financial results of crop insurers such as armtech 

table of contents as an agriculture insurer  we could face losses from commodity price volatility 
a significant portion of our agriculture insurance business provides revenue protection to farmers for their expected crop revenues  which can be affected by changes in crop prices 
we face the risk that significant losses could be incurred in the event of a decline in the applicable commodity prices prior to harvest 
while this risk is partially mitigated by policyholder retentions  it is possible that large declines in the commodity prices of the major crops we insure  including corn  soybeans  cotton and wheat  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition if we are unable to effectively reinsure these risks or enter into applicable commodity price hedges 
if actual renewals of our existing policies and contracts do not meet expectations  our gross premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our insurance policies and reinsurance contracts are generally for a one year term 
in our financial forecasting process  we make assumptions about the renewal of our prior year s policies and contracts 
if actual renewals do not meet expectations  our gross premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
this risk is especially prevalent in the first quarter of each year when a large number of insurance and reinsurance contracts are subject to renewal 
the ongoing development of our us based insurance operations is subject to increased risk from changing market conditions 
excess and surplus lines insurance is a substantial portion of the business written by our us based insurance operations 
excess and surplus lines insurance covers risks that are typically more complex and unusual than standard risks and require a high degree of specialized underwriting 
as a result  excess and surplus lines risks do not often fit the underwriting criteria of standard insurance carriers 
our excess and surplus lines insurance business fills the insurance needs of businesses with unique characteristics and is generally considered higher risk than those in the standard market 
if our underwriting staff inadequately judges and prices the risks associated with the business underwritten in the excess and surplus lines market  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
further  the excess and surplus lines market is significantly affected by the conditions of the property and casualty insurance market in general 
the impact of this cyclicality can be more pronounced in the excess and surplus market than in the standard insurance market 
during times of hard market conditions when market conditions are more favorable to insurers  as rates increase and coverage terms become more restrictive  business tends to move from the admitted market to the excess and surplus lines market and growth in the excess and surplus market can be significantly more rapid than growth in the standard insurance market 
when soft market conditions are prevalent when market conditions are less favorable to insurers  standard insurance carriers tend to loosen underwriting standards and expand market share by moving into business lines traditionally characterized as excess and surplus lines  exacerbating the effect of rate decreases 
if we fail to manage the cyclical nature and volatility of the revenues and profit we generate in the excess and surplus lines market  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
the failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or on our results of operations 
we seek to limit our loss exposure by writing many of our insurance and reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis  adhering to maximum limitations on policies written in defined geographical zones  limiting program size for each client  establishing per risk and per occurrence limitations for each event  employing coverage restrictions and following prudent underwriting guidelines for each program written 
in the case of proportional treaties  we seek per occurrence limitations or loss ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one event 
most of our direct liability insurance policies include maximum aggregate limitations 
we also seek to limit our loss exposure through geographic diversification 
disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum may also arise 
as a result  various provisions of our policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum  may not be enforceable in the manner we intend and some or all of our other loss limitation methods may prove to be ineffective 
underwriting is a matter of judgment  involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control  and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance 
one or more future catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations  possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders equity 
we may be unable to purchase reinsurance and our net income could be reduced or we could incur a net loss in the event of an unusual loss experience 
we purchase reinsurance if it is deemed prudent from a risk mitigation perspective or if it is expected to have a favorable cost benefit relationship relative to our retained risk portfolio 
changes in the availability and cost of reinsurance  which are subject to market conditions that are outside of our control  may reduce to some extent our ability to use reinsurance to balance exposures across our reinsurance or insurance operations 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of reinsurance 
in addition  even if we are able to obtain such reinsurance  we may not be able to negotiate terms that we deem appropriate or acceptable or obtain such reinsurance from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness 

table of contents we are also subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve us of our liability to our clients 
if our reinsurance companies experience financial difficulties  they may be unable to pay us 
in addition  reinsurers may be unwilling to pay us  even though they are able to do so 
the failure of one or more of the our reinsurers to honor their obligations to us in a timely fashion would impact our cash flow and reduce our net income and  depending upon the amount of reinsurance we have purchased  could cause us to incur a significant loss 
a decline in our financial strength ratings could affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our premiums and earnings to decrease 
financial strength ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies 
we currently maintain an am best financial strength rating of a excellent with a stable outlook and an s p financial strength rating of a strong with a stable outlook 
because all of our ratings are subject to continual review  the retention of these ratings cannot be assured 
if our ratings are reduced from their current level by am best or s p  our competitive position in the insurance and reinsurance industry would suffer 
such a downgrade may have a material negative impact on our ability to expand our insurance and reinsurance portfolio and renew our existing insurance and reinsurance policies and agreements  require us to establish trusts or post letters of credit for ceding company clients  and could trigger provisions allowing some ceding company clients to terminate their reinsurance contracts with us on terms disadvantageous to us 
in addition  a downgrade of our am best rating below b two levels below our current rating would constitute an event of default under our bank credit facility 
each of the effects of a downgrade of our financial strength rating described above could make it more expensive or otherwise difficult for us to compete in certain business segments in which we would otherwise desire to operate 
if this were to occur  we could suffer a material and adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations  and the market price for our securities  including any ordinary shares  could be materially and adversely affected 
it is possible that rating agencies may in the future heighten the level of scrutiny they apply when analyzing companies in our industry  may increase the frequency and scope of their reviews  may request additional information from the companies that they rate  and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in their models for maintenance of certain rating levels 
we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take  or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies  which could adversely affect our business 
as with other companies in the financial services industry  our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice 
profitability may be adversely impacted by inflation 
the effects of inflation could cause the cost of claims from catastrophes or other events to rise in the future 
our reserve for losses and loss expenses includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims  we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
adverse changes to the economy in the countries in which we operate could lower the demand for our insurance and reinsurance products and could have a materially adverse effect on the profitability of our operations 
factors such as consumer spending  business investment  government spending  the volatility and strength of the capital markets  and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and  indirectly  the amount and profitability of our business 
in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment  lower family income  lower corporate earnings  lower business investment and lower consumer spending  the demand for insurance products could be adversely affected 
adverse changes in the economy could potentially lead our customers to have less need for insurance coverage  to cancel existing insurance policies  modify coverage or to not renew with us  and our premium revenue could be adversely affected 
challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay premiums as they come due 
the downgrade in the s p credit rating for us government securities and the continuing economic instability in the eurozone have resulted in global financial market uncertainty and economic instability 
consequently  evolving market conditions may continue to affect our investment portfolio  results of operations  financial position and capital resources 
in the event that there is further deterioration or volatility in financial markets or general economic conditions  our investment portfolio  results of operations  financial position and or liquidity  and competitive landscape could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our revenues  loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us 
we market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide through insurance and reinsurance brokers 
in the year ended december   our top three brokers represented approximately of our net premiums written 
loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk 
in accordance with industry practice  we frequently pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance or reinsurance contracts to brokers  and these brokers  in turn  pay these amounts to the clients that have purchased insurance or reinsurance from us 
if a broker fails to make such a payment  in a significant majority of business that we write  it is highly likely that we will be liable to the client for the deficiency because of local laws or contractual obligations  notwithstanding the broker s obligation to make such payment 
likewise  when the client pays premiums for these policies to brokers for payment over to us  these premiums are considered to have been paid and  in most cases  the client will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world with respect to most of our insurance and reinsurance business 
to date we have not experienced any losses related to such credit risks 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect our business by either broadening coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued 
recent examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include an increase in the dollar magnitude of security class action settlements  particularly in the settlement of mega cases  covered by professional liability and directors and officers liability insurance  continued challenges to tort reform by plaintiffs with mixed results across the united states  a low interest rate environment  which continues to create upward pressure on settlement values  a growing trend of plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers relating to claims handling practices in the adjustment of losses relating to natural disasters  and securities litigation with a focus on initial public offerings and merger and acquisition activities 
the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely impact our operating margins 
the insurance and reinsurance industries are highly competitive 
we compete with major us and us insurers and reinsurers  including other bermuda based insurers and reinsurers 
many of our competitors have greater financial  marketing and management resources 
in addition  we may not be aware of other companies that may be planning to enter the segments of the insurance and reinsurance market in which we operate or of existing companies that may be planning to raise additional capital 
increasing competition could result in fewer submissions  lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms and conditions  which could have a material adverse impact on our growth and profitability 
further  insurance risk linked securities and derivative and other non traditional risk transfer mechanisms and vehicles are being developed and offered by other parties  including non insurance company entities  which could impact the demand for traditional insurance or reinsurance 
a number of new  proposed or potential industry or legislative developments could further increase competition in our industry 
new competition from these developments could cause the demand for insurance or reinsurance to fall or the expense of customer acquisition and retention to increase  either of which could have a material adverse affect on our growth and profitability 
the historical cyclicality of the property and casualty reinsurance industry may cause fluctuations in our results 
historically  property and casualty insurers and reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition  frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic events  levels of capacity  general economic conditions and other factors 
demand for insurance and reinsurance is influenced significantly by prevailing general economic conditions and  in the case of reinsurance  the underwriting results of primary property and casualty insurers 
the supply of insurance and reinsurance is related to prevailing prices  the levels of insured losses and the levels of industry surplus which  in turn  may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the insurance and reinsurance industry 
as a result  the insurance and reinsurance 
table of contents business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels 
the continued strength of the industry s surplus position and the establishment of new market entrants has increased the supply of insurance and reinsurance and has caused insurance and reinsurance prices in many of the markets in which we participate to decrease in the past years 
any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates  less favorable policy terms and fewer submissions for insurance and reinsurance coverage 
in addition to these considerations  changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and cedants may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance business significantly 
to the extent these trends continue  our financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
investment risks we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk  including changes in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk  including changes in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  market volatility  the performance of the economy in general  the performance of the specific issuers included in our portfolio and other factors outside our control 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates 
a rise in interest rates  in the absence of other countervailing changes  will reduce the net unrealized gain or increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio 
as portions of our fixed maturity investments mature  we may be forced to reinvest these investments at lower rates  which could result in materially lower investment yields 
in the event that our estimate of our liability cash flow profile is inaccurate  we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a loss in order to cover the liability 
although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to adequately mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads 
if issuer credit spreads widen or increase significantly over an extended period of time  it may result in a net unrealized loss position in our investment portfolio 
if credit spreads tighten significantly  it will reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturity investments 
our exposure to equity price risk relates primarily to equity market price variability 
although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing equity market  we may not be able to adequately mitigate the equity risk of our assets relative to our liabilities 
our primary foreign currency exchange risks are related to net income from foreign operations  non us dollar denominated investments and investments in foreign subsidiaries 
in general  the weakening of foreign currencies versus the us dollar will unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations  the value of non us dollar denominated investments  and investments in foreign subsidiaries 
a portion of our investment portfolio is allocated to other investments that we expect will have different risk characteristics than our investments in traditional fixed maturity investments and short term investments  which in turn could result in a material adverse change to our investment performance  and accordingly adversely affect our financial results 
a portion of our investment portfolio is allocated to other investments  both alternative funds and specialty funds  which we expect to have different risk characteristics than our investments in traditional fixed maturity securities and short term investments 
our alternative funds include investments in hedge funds and private equity funds that generally invest in senior secured bank debt  high yield debt securities  distressed debt  distressed real estate  derivatives and equity long short strategies and constituted of the carrying value of our cash and invested assets as of december  as of december   we are committed to potential future capital calls in the aggregate amount of approximately million in connection with our alternative funds 
our specialty funds currently include investments in high yield loan and convertible debt funds and constituted of the carrying value of our cash and invested assets as of december  the amount and timing of net investment income from such other investments tends to be uneven as a result of the performance of the underlying investments 
the timing of distributions from these investments  which depends on particular events relating to the underlying investments  as well as the funds schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash  can be difficult to predict 
the amount of net investment income that we record from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
many of the investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales that limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
these investments expose us to market risks including interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  equity price risk and credit risk 
in addition  we typically do not hold the underlying securities of these investments in our custody accounts 
as a result  we generally do not have the ability to quantify the risks associated with these investments in the same manner as we have for our fixed maturity portfolio 
the performance of these investments is also dependent on the individual investment managers and their investment strategies 
it is possible that the investment managers will leave and or the investment strategies will become ineffective 
any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse change to our investment performance  and accordingly adversely affect our financial results 

table of contents losses due to defaults by others  including issuers of investment securities which include structured securities such as commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities or high yield bonds  and reinsurance counterparties could adversely affect the value of our investments  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
issuers or borrowers whose securities or loans we hold  customers  reinsurers  clearing agents  exchanges  clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on the principal and interest they owe to us due to bankruptcy  insolvency  lack of liquidity  adverse economic conditions  operational failure  fraud or other reasons 
we are also subject to the risk that the underlying collateral within loan backed securities  including mortgage backed and asset backed securities  may default on principal and interest payments causing an adverse change in cash flows paid to us 
at december   the fixed maturity portfolio of billion represented of our total cash and invested assets 
the occurrence of a major economic downturn  acts of corporate malfeasance  widening risk spreads  or other events that adversely impact the issuers  guarantors or underlying collateral of these securities could cause the value of our fixed maturity portfolio and our net income to decline and the default rate of the fixed maturity investments to increase 
a ratings downgrade affecting issuers or guarantors of particular securities  or similar trends that could worsen the credit quality of issuers  such as the corporate issuers of securities in our investment portfolio  could also have a similar effect 
with economic uncertainty  credit quality of issuers or guarantors could be adversely affected 
similarly  a ratings downgrade affecting a loan backed security we hold could indicate the credit quality of that security has deteriorated 
any event reducing the value of these securities other than on a temporary basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
levels of write down or impairment are impacted by our assessment of the intent and ability to hold securities which have declined in value and whether such declines in the company s value below amortized cost are due to credit related factors 
we have also engaged third party investment managers to provide us with investment advisory and management services 
it is possible that the investment strategies employed by these third party investment managers may become ineffective or that such managers will fail to follow our investment guidelines  which could result in a material adverse change to our investment performance  and accordingly adversely affect our financial results 
the further downgrade of us or foreign government securities by credit rating agencies could adversely impact the value of the us or foreign government and other securities in our investment portfolio and create uncertainty in the market generally 
the further downgrade of the us or foreign government securities by credit rating agencies has the potential to adversely impact the value of the us or foreign government and other securities in our investment portfolio 
a further downgrade in the rating of us or foreign government securities may cause the company s investment portfolio s average credit rating to fall and may result in the company no longer being in compliance with its current investment policy at its current level of us or foreign government security holdings 
in addition to the foregoing  a further downgrade in the rating of us or foreign government securities may have an adverse impact on fixed income markets  which in turn could cause our net investment income to decline or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our investment portfolio contains direct and indirect exposure to the indebtedness and equity securities of those countries whose currency is the euro or whose sovereign debt rating is below aaa except the us which may be subject to increased liquidity risk  interest rate risk and default risk as a result of deteriorating economic conditions in those countries 
increased defaults or a significant increase in interest rates could result in losses  realized or unrealized  in the fair value of our investment portfolio and  consequently  could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 
the determination of the other than temporary impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
the determination of the amount of other than temporary impairments recognized on our investments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class as well as an analysis on a security by security basis 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised 
during periods of market disruption including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates  rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity  it may be difficult to value certain of our securities  such as mortgage backed securities  if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable 
in addition  there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid 
in such cases  more securities may require more subjectivity and management judgment in determining their values  including the use of inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods  which are more sophisticated or require greater estimation thereby resulting in values which may differ materially from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold 
further  rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly 
decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents there can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken in our financial statements 
furthermore  additional impairments may need to be taken in the future  which could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments 
some of our investments are relatively illiquid and are in asset classes that may experience significant market valuation fluctuations 
we hold certain investments that may lack liquidity  such as our alternative funds and specialty funds 
if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements or are required to post or return collateral in connection with our investment portfolio or securities lending activities  we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
the reported value of our relatively illiquid types of investments and  at times  our high quality  generally liquid asset classes  do not necessarily reflect the lowest current market price for the asset 
if we were forced to sell certain of our assets in the current market  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them  and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices 
we are exposed to equity market and derivative financial instrument risks  which may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
we are exposed to risks associated with our investments in equity securities and investments in derivative financial instruments  which are subject to significant financial and capital markets risk  including changes in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices  real estate markets  foreign currency exchange rates  market volatility  the performance of the economy in general  the performance of the specific securities included in our investment portfolio and other factors outside our control 
our exposure to equity price risk relates primarily to equity market price variability 
although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing equity market  we may not be able to adequately mitigate the equity risk of our assets relative to our liabilities  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
losses due to defaults by our derivative counterparties could adversely affect the value of our investments  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
derivative counterparties may default on the amounts they owe to us due to bankruptcy  insolvency  lack of liquidity  adverse economic conditions  operational failure  fraud or other reasons 
the occurrence of a major economic downturn  acts of corporate malfeasance  widening risk spreads or other events that adversely impact our derivative counterparties or the collateral supporting our derivative instruments could cause our net income to decline and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our failure to comply with the financial strength standards governing our derivative instruments could obligate us to post collateral or settle our outstanding derivative instruments 
certain of the company s derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings of the individual legal entity which entered into the derivative agreement as set by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies 
if the legal entity s financial strength were to fall below certain ratings  the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and in certain instances demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement 
the settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement 
if the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  financial condition  results of operations and ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity 
our investment liquidity and investment performance may affect our financial assets and ability to conduct business 
we derive a significant portion of our income from our invested assets 
as a result  our operating results depend in part on the performance of our investment portfolio  which consists primarily of fixed maturity investments 
our income derived from our invested assets including net realized and unrealized gains and net impairment losses recognized in earnings was million for the year ended december  our operating results are subject to a variety of investment risks  including risks relating to general economic conditions  market volatility  interest rate fluctuations  liquidity risk and credit and default risk 
in addition  we are subject to pre payment or reinvestment risk as well as restrictions on redemptions or sale of certain of our investments 

table of contents with respect to our liabilities  we strive to structure our investments in a manner that recognizes their cash flow profile and our potential liquidity needs 
in that regard  we attempt to correlate the maturity and duration of our investment portfolio to our liability profile 
however  if our liquidity needs or liability profile unexpectedly changes  we may not be successful in continuing to structure our investment portfolio in that manner 
the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio will be subject to fluctuations depending on changes in various factors  including prevailing interest rates 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in correlating our investment portfolio with our liabilities  we may be forced to liquidate our investments at times and prices that are not optimal  which could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our investment portfolio 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
although we take measures to attempt to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively 
a significant increase in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our book value 
liquidity and capital risks our holding company structure and certain regulatory and other constraints affect our ability to pay dividends and make other payments 
endurance holdings is a holding company and  as such  has no substantial operations of its own 
dividends and other permitted distributions from our operating subsidiaries are expected to be endurance holdings primary source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements  including debt service payments and other expenses  and to pay dividends  if any  to shareholders 
bermuda law and regulations  including  but not limited to  bermuda insurance regulations  restrict the declaration and payment of dividends and the making of distributions by endurance bermuda unless certain regulatory requirements are met 
the inability of endurance bermuda to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable endurance holdings to meet its cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on its operations 
in addition  endurance holdings us and us operating subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends 
we therefore do not expect to receive material dividends from these operating subsidiaries for the foreseeable future 
endurance holdings is subject to bermuda regulatory constraints that will affect its ability to pay dividends on its ordinary shares  class a shares  non cumulative preferred shares  series a and non cumulative preferred shares  series b together  the preferred shares and to make other payments 
under the bermuda companies act  as amended the companies act  endurance holdings may declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of retained earnings or contributed surplus only if it has reasonable grounds for believing that it is  or would after the payment be  able to pay its liabilities as they become due and if the realizable value of its assets would thereby not be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and issued share capital and share premium accounts 
in addition  the terms of our credit facility prohibit endurance holdings from declaring or paying any dividends if a default or event of default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such declaration or payment or would result from such declaration or payment 
in addition  the terms of the preferred shares prohibit the declaration or payment of dividends on our ordinary shares unless dividends on the preferred shares have been declared and paid 
preference shares  including the preferred shares  may also not be redeemed if as a result of the redemption  our issued share capital would be reduced below the minimum capital specified in the memorandum of association of endurance holdings 
we could incur substantial losses and reduced liquidity if one of the financial institutions we use in our operations  including those institutions that participate in our credit facility  fails 
we have exposure to counterparties in many different industries and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  hedge funds and other investment funds and other institutions 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty 
in addition  with respect to secured transactions  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the obligation 
current reinsurance recoverables are subject to the credit risk of the reinsurers 
we maintain cash balances  including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts  significantly in excess of the fdic insurance limits at various depository institutions 
we also maintain cash balances in foreign banks and institutions and rely upon funding commitments from several banks and financial institutions that participate in our credit facility 
if one or more of these financial institutions were to fail  our ability to access cash balances or draw down on our credit facility may be temporarily or permanently limited  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 

table of contents the cost of reinsurance security arrangements may materially impact our margins 
as a bermuda reinsurer  endurance bermuda is required to post collateral with respect to reinsurance liabilities it assumes from ceding insurers domiciled in the us the posting of collateral is generally required in order for us ceding companies to obtain credit on their us statutory financial statements with respect to reinsurance liabilities ceded to unlicensed or unaccredited reinsurers  such as endurance bermuda 
under applicable statutory provisions  the security arrangements may be in the form of letters of credit  reinsurance trusts maintained by third party trustees or funds withheld arrangements whereby the trusteed assets are held by the ceding company 
endurance bermuda has the ability to issue up to billion in letters of credit under our letter of credit and revolving credit facility that expires on may  if this facility is not sufficient or if the company is unable to renew this facility or is unable to arrange for other types of security on commercially acceptable terms  the ability of endurance bermuda to provide reinsurance to us based clients may be severely limited 
security arrangements may subject our assets to security interests and or require that a portion of our assets be pledged to  or otherwise held by  third parties 
although the investment income derived from our assets while held in trust typically accrues to our benefit  the investment of these assets is governed by the investment regulations of the state of domicile of the ceding insurer  which may be more restrictive than the investment regulations applicable to us under bermuda law 
the restrictions may result in lower investment yields on these assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs  access to capital and cost of capital 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including our ability to underwrite new business successfully  to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses  and to maintain our current rating agency ratings 
in addition  we need liquidity to pay our operating expenses and without sufficient liquidity  we will be forced to curtail our operations  and our business will suffer 
the principal sources of our liquidity are our invested assets 
sources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short and long term instruments  including repurchase agreements  commercial paper  medium and long term debt  junior subordinated debt securities  capital securities and shareholders equity 
in the event current resources do not satisfy our needs  we may have to seek additional financing 
the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the volume of trading activities  the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry  our credit ratings and credit capacity  as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or short term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn 
similarly  our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us 
our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient  and in such case  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business  most significantly our insurance operations 
such market conditions may limit our ability to replace  in a timely manner  maturing liabilities  satisfy statutory capital requirements  generate fee income and market related revenue to meet liquidity needs  and access the capital necessary to grow our business 
as such  we may be forced to delay raising capital  issue shorter tenor securities than we prefer  or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our shareholders could result  and in any case such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our already outstanding securities 
in the case of debt financings  our credit spreads have generally widened since we previously issued debt securities  which could lead to higher interest costs on new debt 
our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets and an inability to obtain adequate capital 
our failure to comply with restrictive covenants contained in the indentures governing our senior notes or our current or future credit facility could trigger prepayment obligations  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries with respect to  among other things  the incurrence of liens and the disposition of capital stock of these subsidiaries 
in addition  our credit facility requires us and or certain of our subsidiaries to comply with certain covenants  including the maintenance of a minimum consolidated net tangible worth and restrictions on the payment of dividends 
our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default under the indentures or our credit facility  which  if not cured or waived  could result in us being required to repay the notes or any amounts outstanding under the credit facility prior to maturity 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents legal and regulatory risks recent or future legislation may decrease the demand for our property catastrophe reinsurance products and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
it is possible that u 
s states  particularly those with atlantic or gulf coast exposures  may enact new or expanded legislation establishing further state involvement in providing or governing the insurance or reinsurance of catastrophe exposed risks  or may otherwise enact legislation  which would further diminish aggregate private market demand for our products 
alternatively  legislation adversely impacting the private markets could be enacted on a regional or at the federal level 
moreover  we believe that numerous modeled potential catastrophes could exceed the actual or politically acceptable bonded capacity of one or more of the catastrophe funds established by us states  which could lead either to a severe dislocation or the necessity of federal intervention in the markets of one or more of those states  either of which would adversely impact the private insurance and reinsurance industry 
the regulatory system under which we operate  and potential changes thereto  including heightened scrutiny of issues and practices in the insurance industry could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the laws and regulations under which we operate  such as the regulations governing our insurance rates and forms  the us multi peril crop insurance program and the purchase of reinsurance by property insurers in florida  could be revised in a manner materially adverse to the manner in which we conduct our business 
currently  there are several proposals to amend state insurance holding company laws to increase the scope of the regulation of insurance holding companies 
these proposals include imposing standards for corporate governance  group wide supervision of insurance holding companies  adjustments to risk based capital calculations to account for group wide risks and additional regulatory and disclosure requirements for insurance holding companies 
in addition  changes to state laws and regulations may result from attention by state insurance regulators on the us insurance solvency regulation framework pursuant to the naic s solvency modernization initiative 
the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework continues to be subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including the us and various states within the us certain government authorities  including state officials in florida  new york and connecticut  have from time to time investigated a number of issues and practices within the insurance industry 
it is possible such scrutiny could include us and it is also possible that these investigations or related regulatory developments could mandate or otherwise give rise to changes in industry practices in a fashion that increases our costs or requires us to alter how we conduct our business 
in addition  if our bermuda insurance or reinsurance operations become subject to the insurance laws of any state in the us  we could face inquiries or challenges to the future operations of these companies 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary licenses  permits  authorizations or accreditations  or may be able to do so only at great cost 
in addition  we may not be able to comply fully with  or obtain appropriate exemptions from  the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance or reinsurance companies or holding companies 
failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and fines and other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
although surplus lines business is generally less regulated than the admitted market  the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future 
federal and or state measures may be introduced and promulgated that could result in increased oversight and regulation of surplus lines insurance 
endurance american and endurance risk solutions write insurance on an admitted basis within the us and are subject to extensive regulation 
endurance american and endurance risk solutions are primarily regulated by their state of domicile under state statutes which confer comprehensive regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers on state insurance commissioners 
such regulation generally is designed to protect policyholders rather than investors or shareholders of the insurer 
our current or future business strategy could cause one or more of our currently unregulated non insurance subsidiaries to become subject to some form of regulation 
any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on our ability to do business  and could also result in fines and other sanctions  any or all of which could adversely affect our financial results and operations 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel intensive  and changes in these laws and regulations may impact the operations of our insurance and non insurance subsidiaries and ultimately could impact our financial condition as well 
in addition  we could be adversely affected if a regulatory authority believed we had failed to comply with applicable law or regulation 
despite our efforts to maintain effective compliance procedures  there is a risk that applicable laws and regulations may be unclear  subject to multiple interpretations  under development or may conflict with one another  that regulators may revise their previous guidance or that courts overturn previous rulings  or that we could otherwise fail to meet the applicable standards 

table of contents the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act may adversely impact our business 
the us congress and the current administration have made  or called for consideration of  several additional proposals relating to a variety of issues with respect to financial regulation reform  including regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  the establishment of a single state system of licensure for us and foreign reinsurers  regulation of executive compensation and others 
one of those initiatives  the dodd frank act  was signed into law by president obama on july  the dodd frank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states and establishes a federal insurance office under the us treasury department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of lines of business other than certain health insurance  certain long term care insurance and crop insurance 
the director of the federal insurance office will have the ability to recommend that an insurance company or an insurance holding company be subject to heightened prudential standards under the supervision of the federal reserve 
the dodd frank act also provides for the pre emption of state laws in certain instances involving the regulation of reinsurance and other limited insurance matters and established the federal bureau of consumer financial protection the bcfp which will require the bcfp and other federal agencies to implement many new rules 
at this time  it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty whether any other proposed legislation  rules or regulatory changes will be adopted or what impact  if any  the dodd frank or any other such legislation  rules or changes could have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
solvency ii could adversely impact our financial results and operations 
solvency ii  a european union directive concerning the capital adequacy  risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers  which was adopted by the european parliament in april of  may adversely affect our re insurance businesses 
implementation of solvency ii by the european commission is expected to take effect january  in the european union member states  and will replace the current solvency requirements 
implementation of solvency ii will require us to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance 
in addition  the implementing measures that will establish the technical requirements governing the practical application of solvency ii remain subject to a consultation process  consequently  our implementation plans are based on our current understanding of the solvency ii requirements  which may change 
the european union is in the process of considering the solvency ii equivalence of bermuda s insurance regulatory and supervisory regime 
the european union equivalence assessment considers whether bermuda s regulatory regime provides a similar level of policyholder protection as provided under solvency ii 
a finding that bermuda s insurance regulatory regime is not equivalent to the european union s solvency ii could have an adverse effect on our reinsurance operations in the european union and on our group solvency calculations 
such a finding could also have adverse indirect commercial impacts on our operations 
we are monitoring the ongoing legislative and regulatory steps following adoption of solvency ii 
the principles  standards and requirements of solvency ii may also  directly or indirectly  impact the future supervision of additional operating subsidiaries of ours 
operational risks changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially impact our reported financial results 
unanticipated developments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional expenses to comply with such developments  particularly if it is required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively 
the impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net income  net equity  and other relevant financial statement line items 
for example  the current proposal for the convergence of us gaap with international financial reporting standards ifrs may require the company to prepare financial statements in accordance with ifrs for the year ended december   including comparative information also prepared under ifrs for the two previous years 
also  recent proposals from us and international standard setters have indicated a possible move away from the current insurance accounting models toward a more present value based model which could introduce significant volatility in the earnings of insurance industry participants and significant changes in financial statement presentations and disclosures 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may not be indicative of our long term prospects 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
these fluctuations result from a variety of factors  including the seasonality of the reinsurance and insurance business  the volume and mix of reinsurance and insurance products that we write  loss experience on our reinsurance and insurance liabilities  the performance of our investment portfolio and our ability to assess and integrate our risk management strategy effectively 
in particular  we seek to underwrite products and make investments to achieve long term results 
as a result  our short term results of operations may not be indicative of our long term prospects 
if actual claims exceed our reserve for losses and loss expenses  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our success depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we insure or reinsure 
we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability 
rather  loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost 
these estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data  as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors 
loss reserve estimates are refined continually in an ongoing process as experience develops and claims are reported and settled 
establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process 
moreover  these uncertainties are greater for companies like us than for those with a longer operating history because we do not yet have an extensive loss history 
because of this uncertainty  it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate 

table of contents to the extent we determine that actual losses and loss expenses exceed our expectations and loss reserves recorded in our financial statements  we will be required to increase our reserve for losses and loss expenses 
this could cause a material reduction in our profitability and capital 
we may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
we have made a significant investment in the capitalization of endurance uk  which is denominated in british sterling 
in addition  we enter into reinsurance and insurance contracts where we are obligated to pay losses in currencies other than us dollars 
for the year ended december   approximately of our gross premiums were written in currencies other than the us dollar 
a portion of our cash and cash equivalents  investments and loss reserves are also denominated in non us currencies 
the majority of our operating foreign currency assets and liabilities are denominated in euros  british sterling  canadian dollars  japanese yen  new zealand dollars and australian dollars 
we may  from time to time  experience losses from fluctuations in the values of these and other non us currencies  which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
we periodically buy and sell currencies or investment securities denominated in non us dollars in an attempt to match our non us dollar assets to our related non us dollar liabilities 
we currently have no currency hedges in place but may implement hedges in the future 
as part of our asset liability matching strategy  we also consider the use of hedges when we become aware of probable significant losses that will be paid in non us currencies 
however  it is possible that we will not successfully match our exposures or structure the hedges to effectively manage these risks 
acquisitions or strategic investments that we made or may make could turn out to be unsuccessful 
as part of our strategy  we have pursued and may continue to pursue growth through acquisitions and or strategic investments in new businesses 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments as well as the integration of an acquired business or new personnel could result in a substantial diversion of management resources 
successful integration will depend on  among other things  our ability to effectively integrate acquired businesses or new personnel into our existing risk management techniques  our ability to effectively manage any regulatory issues created by our entry into new markets and geographic locations  our ability to retain key personnel and other operational and economic factors 
there can be no assurance that the integration of acquired business or new personnel will be successful or that the business acquired will prove to be profitable or sustainable 
the failure to integrate successfully or to manage the challenges presented by the integration process may adversely impact our financial results 
acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks such as potential losses from unanticipated litigation or levels of claims and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs 
our ability to manage our growth through acquisitions or strategic investments will depend  in part  on our success in addressing these risks 
any failure by us to effectively implement our acquisitions or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
operational risks  including systems or human failures  are inherent in business  including ours 
we are subject to operational risks including fraud  employee errors  failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization  failure to comply with regulatory requirements or obligations under our agreements  information technology failures  or external events 
losses from these risks may occur from time to time and may be significant 
as our business and operations grow more complex  we are exposed to more risk in these areas 
our modeling  underwriting and information technology systems are critical to our success 
moreover  our proprietary technology and application systems have been an important part of our underwriting strategy and our ability to compete successfully 
we have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties 
we cannot be certain that we will have access to these  or comparable  service providers  or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended 
while we have implemented disaster recovery and other business continuity plans  a defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology systems could result in reduced or delayed revenue growth  higher than expected losses  management distraction  or harm to our operations and or our reputation 
we believe appropriate controls and mitigation procedures are in place to prevent significant risk of defect in our internal controls and information technology systems  but internal controls provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance as to the absence of errors or irregularities and any ineffectiveness of such controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents cyber security incidents could disrupt business operations  result in the loss of critical and confidential information  and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations 
global cyber security threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats 
while we employ measures to prevent  detect  address and mitigate these threats including access controls  data encryption  vulnerability assessments  continuous monitoring of our information technology networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems  cyber security incidents  depending on their nature and scope  could potentially result in the misappropriation  destruction  corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations 
the potential consequences of a material cyber security incident include reputational damage  litigation with third parties  increased cyber security protection and remediation costs and loss of key data and systems  which in turn could have a material impact on our results of operation or financial condition 
since we are dependent on key executives  the loss of any of these executives or our inability to retain other key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our success substantially depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and upon the ability of our senior management and other key employees to implement our business strategy 
we believe there are only a limited number of available qualified executives in the business lines in which we compete 
we rely substantially upon the services of david cash  chief executive officer  and william m 
jewett  president 
we believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining key personnel since our inception 
the loss of any of their services or the services of other members of our management team or the inability to attract and retain other talented personnel could impede the further implementation of our business strategy  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 
our business could be adversely affected by bermuda employment restrictions 
we will need to continue to hire employees to work in bermuda 
under bermuda law  non bermudians other than spouses of bermudians or prc holders may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit 
work permits may be granted or extended by the bermuda government upon showing that  after proper public advertisement in most cases  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian or prc holder is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position 
current bermuda law limits the duration of work permits to six years  with certain exemptions for key employees 
under new legislation it may be possible for the most senior non bermudian executives to be eligible for permanent resident status after years residence in bermuda and employment with the company 
all of our bermuda based professional employees who require work permits have been granted permits by the bermuda government 
the terms of such permits usually range from three to five years at the time of grant depending on the individual 
it is possible that we could lose the services of one or more of our key employees if we are unable to obtain or renew their work permits  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
corporate risks there are provisions in our charter documents that may reduce or increase the voting rights of our ordinary shares 
the bye laws of endurance holdings generally provide that any shareholder owning  directly  indirectly or  in the case of any us person  by attribution  outstanding ordinary shares possessing more than of the aggregate voting power of our ordinary shares will have their voting rights reduced so that they may not exercise more than of the voting rights conferred by our ordinary shares 
under these provisions  certain shareholders may have their voting rights limited to less than one vote per share  while other shareholders may have voting rights in excess of one vote per share 
moreover  these provisions could have the effect of reducing the votes of certain shareholders who would not otherwise be subject to the limitation by virtue of their direct share ownership 
the bye laws of endurance holdings provide that shareholders will be notified of their voting interests prior to any vote to be taken by the shareholders 
as a result of any reallocation of votes  your voting rights might increase above of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding ordinary shares  thereby possibly resulting in your becoming a reporting person subject to schedule d or g filing requirements under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
in addition  the reallocation of your votes could result in your becoming subject to filing requirements under section of the exchange act 
we also have the authority to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining whether a shareholder s voting rights are to be reallocated pursuant to the bye laws 
if a shareholder fails to respond to a request for information from us or submits incomplete or inaccurate information after a reasonable cure period in response to a request  we may  in our reasonable discretion  reduce or eliminate the shareholder s voting rights 

table of contents provisions of endurance holdings bye laws may restrict the ability to transfer shares of endurance holdings 
endurance holdings board of directors may decline to register a transfer of any ordinary shares if the relevant instrument of transfer if any is in favor of five persons or more jointly or is not properly executed  the transferred shares are not fully paid shares or if the transferor fails to comply with all applicable laws and regulations governing the transfer 
a shareholder may be required to sell its shares of endurance 
the bye laws of endurance holdings provide that we have the option  but not the obligation  to require a shareholder to sell its ordinary shares for their fair market value to us  to other shareholders or to third parties if we determine  based on the written advice of legal counsel  that failure to exercise our option would result in non de minimis adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences to us or certain us persons as to which the shares held by such shareholder constitute controlled shares 
in the latter case  our right to require a shareholder to sell its ordinary shares to us will be limited to the purchase of a number of ordinary shares that will permit avoidance of those adverse tax consequences 
a shareholder may be required to indemnify us for any tax liability that results from the acts of that shareholder 
the bye laws of endurance holdings provide certain protections against adverse tax consequences to us resulting from laws that apply to the shareholders of endurance holdings 
if a shareholder s death or non payment of any tax or duty payable by the shareholder  or any other act or thing involving the shareholder  causes any adverse tax consequences to us i the shareholder or his executor or administrator is required to indemnify us against any tax liability that we incur as a result  ii we will have a lien on any dividends or any other distributions payable to the shareholder by us to the extent of the tax liability and iii if any amounts not covered by our lien on dividends and distributions are owed to us by the shareholder as a result of our tax liability  we have the right to refuse to register any transfer of the shareholder s shares 
there are regulatory limitations on the ownership and transfer of our ordinary shares 
state laws in the united states and the united kingdom require prior notices or regulatory agency approval of changes in control of an insurer or its holding company 
the insurance laws of the domiciliary jurisdiction provide that no corporation or other person except in certain jurisdictions an authorized insurer may acquire control of a domestic insurance or reinsurance company unless it has given notice and obtained prior written approval of the appropriate regulatory agency 
any purchaser of or more of our ordinary shares could become subject to such regulations and could be required to file certain notices and reports with the insurance commissioners of the domiciliary jurisdictions of our operating companies 
us persons who own our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than us persons who are shareholders of a us corporation 
the companies act  which applies to endurance holdings and endurance bermuda  differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders 
these differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest  the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers 
anti takeover provisions in our bye laws could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors  which could diminish the value of our ordinary shares 
endurance holdings bye laws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so 
in addition  these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable 
even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt  these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our ordinary shares if they are viewed as discouraging changes in management and takeover attempts in the future 
it may be difficult to enforce service of process and enforcement of judgments against us and our officers and directors 
endurance holdings is a bermuda company and certain of its officers and directors are residents of jurisdictions outside the united states 
a substantial portion of its assets and its officers and directors  at any one time  are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the united states 
it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or to enforce against us or our directors and officers judgments of us courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 

table of contents there is no treaty in force between the united states and bermuda providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
as a result  whether a united states judgment would be enforceable in bermuda against us or our directors and officers depends on whether the us court that entered the judgment is recognized by the bermuda court as having jurisdiction over us or our directors and officers  as determined by reference to bermuda conflict of law rules 
in addition to and irrespective of jurisdictional issues  the bermuda courts will not enforce a united states federal securities law that is either penal or contrary to bermuda public policy 
an action brought pursuant to a public or penal law  the purpose of which is the enforcement of a sanction  power or right at the instance of the state in its sovereign capacity  will not be entertained by a bermuda court 
consequently  certain remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions  including certain remedies under us federal securities laws  may not be available under bermuda law or enforceable in a bermuda court  as they may be contrary to bermuda public policy 
further  no claim may be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of us federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial jurisdiction under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 
taxation risks we and our subsidiaries may be subject to us tax which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
endurance holdings and endurance bermuda are bermuda companies and endurance uk is an english company 
endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and endurance uk each intend to operate in such a manner that none of these companies will be deemed to be engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the united states 
nevertheless  because definitive identification of activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the united states is not provided by the internal revenue code code  regulations or court decisions  the internal revenue service irs might successfully contend that any of endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and or endurance uk are is engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
if endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and or endurance uk were was engaged in a trade or business in the united states  and if endurance uk or endurance bermuda was to qualify for benefits under the applicable income tax treaty with the united states  but such trade or business was attributable to a permanent establishment in the united states or in the case of endurance bermuda  with respect to investment income  arguably even if such income was not attributable to a permanent establishment  endurance holdings  endurance uk and or endurance bermuda would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income that is effectively connected with the us trade or business  plus an additional branch profits tax in certain circumstances  in which case our financial condition and results of operations and your investment could be materially adversely affected 
holders of endurance holdings ordinary shares or preferred shares who own or more of our voting power may be subject to taxation under the controlled foreign corporation cfc rules 
certain us shareholders of a foreign corporation that is considered a controlled foreign corporation a cfc for us federal income tax purposes must include in gross income such us shareholder s pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income  even if the subpart f income is not distributed 
see material tax considerations certain united states federal income tax considerations united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and preferred shares shareholders who are us persons classification of endurance holdings  endurance uk or endurance bermuda as a controlled foreign corporation 
due to the dispersion of endurance holdings share ownership among holders  its bye law provisions that impose limitations on the concentration of voting power of its shares entitled to vote and authorize endurance holdings to purchase such shares under certain circumstances  and other factors  no us person that owns shares in endurance holdings directly or indirectly through foreign entities should be subject to treatment as a us shareholder of a cfc 
it is possible  however  that the irs could challenge the effectiveness of these provisions and that a court could sustain such a challenge 
accordingly  investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the cfc rules to an investment in endurance holdings 
us persons who hold ordinary shares or preferred shares may be subject to us income taxation on their pro rata share of our related party insurance income rpii 
the cfc rules apply to certain insurance and reinsurance companies that earn rpii 
if the rpii rules were to apply to endurance uk or endurance bermuda  a us person who owns ordinary shares or preferred shares of endurance holdings directly or indirectly through foreign entities on the last day of the taxable year would be required to include in its income for us federal income tax purposes the shareholder s pro rata share of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s rpii for the entire taxable year  determined as if such rpii were distributed proportionately to such us shareholders at that date regardless of whether such income is distributed 
in addition  any rpii that is includible in the income of a us tax exempt organization would be treated as unrelated business taxable income 
although endurance uk and endurance bermuda intend to generally operate in a manner so as to qualify for certain exceptions to the rpii rules  there can be no assurance that these exceptions will be available 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that us persons who own ordinary shares or preferred shares will not be required to recognize gross income inclusions attributable to rpii 
see material tax considerations certain united states federal income tax considerations united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and preferred shares shareholders who are us persons rpii companies  rpii exceptions 

table of contents the rpii rules provide that if a shareholder who is a us person disposes of shares in a foreign insurance corporation that has rpii and in which us persons collectively own or more of the shares  any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the shareholder s share of the corporation s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the shareholder owned the shares whether or not such earnings and profits are attributable to rpii 
in addition  such a shareholder will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements  regardless of the amount of shares owned by the shareholder 
these rules should not apply to dispositions of ordinary shares or preferred shares because endurance holdings will not itself be directly engaged in the insurance business 
the rpii provisions  however  have not been interpreted by the courts or the us treasury department  and regulations interpreting the rpii provisions of the code exist only in proposed form 
accordingly  the irs might interpret the proposed regulations in a different manner and the applicable proposed regulations may be promulgated in final form in a manner that would cause these rules to apply to dispositions of our ordinary shares and preferred shares

us persons who hold ordinary shares or preferred shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences if we are considered a passive foreign investment company a pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
we believe that we should not be considered a pfic for us federal income purposes for the year ended december  moreover  we do not expect to conduct our activities in a manner that would cause us to become a pfic in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge this position or that a court will not sustain such challenge 
accordingly  it is possible that we could be deemed a pfic by the irs or a court for the year or any future year 
if we were considered a pfic  it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to us federal income taxation  including subjecting the investor to a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply or subjecting the investor to tax on amounts in advance of when tax would otherwise be imposed 
there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the pfic provisions to an insurance company 
new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be forthcoming 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such guidance would have on a shareholder that is subject to us federal income taxation 
see material tax considerations certain united states federal income tax considerations united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and preferred shares shareholders who are us persons passive foreign investment companies 
changes to us tax legislation could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders the us congress and president obama s administration have discussed from time to time proposals intended to eliminate certain perceived tax advantages of companies including insurance and reinsurance companies that have legal domiciles outside the united states but have certain us connections 
in particular  president obama s budget for fiscal year includes proposals that would deny a us non life insurance company a deduction for certain non taxed reinsurance premiums paid to affiliates and defer interest deductions related to certain foreign source income 
congress has introduced similar legislation that would deny a us non life insurance company a deduction for certain non taxed reinsurance premiums paid to affiliates  and  during prior sessions  congress had introduced proposals relating to tax haven jurisdictions  cross border transactions  intangible products  and a proposal that would treat a foreign corporation that is primarily managed and controlled in the united states as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes 
we cannot be certain if  when or in what form any such legislation may be enacted and whether such legislation  if enacted  would have retroactive effect 
enactment of some versions of such legislation as well as other changes in us tax laws  regulations and interpretations of such legislation or tax law changes to address these issues could adversely affect the results of our operations and financial condition and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the european union are considering measures that might increase our taxes and reduce our net income 
the oecd has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
in the oecd s periodic progress reports  bermuda has not been listed as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices and to embrace international tax standards for transparency  exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity 
bermuda was included in the most recently revised oecd white list with other countries that have substantially implemented the oecd s international tax standards 
we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes 

table of contents we may become subject to taxes in bermuda after march   which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the bermuda minister of finance  under the exempted undertakings tax protection act  as amended  of bermuda  has given endurance holdings and endurance bermuda an assurance that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition any such tax will not be applicable to endurance holdings  endurance bermuda or any of their respective operations  shares  debentures or other obligations until march  it is possible that after march  we may be subject to bermuda taxes

the declaration and payment of future dividends is also subject to certain legal  regulatory and other restrictions 
endurance holdings is a holding company and has no direct operations 
the ability of endurance holdings to pay dividends or distributions depends almost exclusively on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to endurance holdings 
under bermuda law  endurance bermuda may not declare or pay a dividend if there are reasonable grounds for believing that endurance bermuda is  or would after the payment be  unable to pay its liabilities as they become due  or the realizable value of endurance bermuda s assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts 
further  endurance bermuda  as a regulated insurance company in bermuda  is subject to additional regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions 
as of december   the maximum amount of distributions that endurance bermuda could pay to endurance holdings under applicable insurance and companies act regulations without prior regulatory approval was approximately million

endurance uk is currently completing statutory income loss statements for the year ended december  the company does not expect endurance uk to have material dividend capacity in as of december   endurance us reinsurance  endurance american  endurance risk solutions and endurance american specialty did not have earned surplus and thus were precluded from dividend distributions in without prior regulatory approval

executive overview endurance specialty holdings ltd 
endurance holdings was organized as a bermuda holding company on june  endurance holdings has seven wholly owned operating subsidiaries endurance specialty insurance ltd 
endurance bermuda  domiciled in bermuda with branch offices in zurich and singapore  endurance reinsurance corporation of america endurance us reinsurance  domiciled in delaware  endurance worldwide insurance limited endurance uk  domiciled in england  endurance american insurance company endurance american  domiciled in delaware  endurance american specialty insurance company endurance american specialty  domiciled in delaware  endurance risk solutions assurance co 
endurance risk solutions  domiciled in delaware  and american agri business insurance company  managed by armtech insurance services  inc collectively armtech  both domiciled in texas 
endurance holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries are collectively referred to in this discussion and analysis as the company 
the company writes specialty lines of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance on a global basis and seeks to create a portfolio of specialty lines of business that are profitable and have limited correlation with one another 
the company s portfolio of specialty lines of business is organized into two business segments  insurance and reinsurance 
in the insurance segment  the company writes agriculture  professional lines  casualty  property  healthcare liability  and surety and other specialty insurance 
in the reinsurance segment  the company writes catastrophe  casualty  property  aerospace and marine  and surety and other specialty reinsurance 
the company s insurance and reinsurance segments both include property related coverages  which provide insurance or reinsurance of an insurable interest in tangible property for property loss  damage or loss of use 
in addition  the company s insurance and reinsurance segments include various casualty insurance and reinsurance coverages  which are primarily concerned with the losses caused by injuries to third parties  ie  not the insured  or to property owned by third parties and the legal liability imposed on the insured resulting from such injuries 
business and accounting factors the company s results of operations are affected by the following business and accounting factors revenues 
the company derives its revenues primarily from premiums from its insurance policies and reinsurance contracts 
the premiums the company charges for the risks assumed are priced based on many assumptions and are a function of the amount and type of policies and contracts the company writes as well as prevailing market prices  and in the case of agricultural insurance contracts  federally mandated pricing and commodity price levels 
the company prices these risks before its ultimate costs are known  which may extend many years into the future 

table of contents the company s revenues also include income generated from its investment portfolio 
the company s investment portfolio is comprised of fixed maturity investments  short term investments and equity securities that are held as available for sale and other investments  comprised of alternative and specialty loan funds that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap  the available for sale investments are carried at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses on the company s investments are generally excluded from earnings 
these unrealized gains and losses are included on the company s balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
if unrealized losses are considered to be other than temporarily impaired due to the company s intent to sell  requirement to sell such securities or credit related factors  such losses are included in earnings as net impairment losses recognized in losses earnings 
for other investments  the company increases or decreases the value of these investments for the company s share of income or loss  less dividends  which is included in net investment income 
expenses 
the company s expenses consist primarily of losses and loss expenses  acquisition expenses  interest expense  amortization of intangible assets and general and administrative expenses 
losses and loss expenses are estimated by management and reflect its best estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment costs arising during the current reporting period and revisions of prior period estimates 
the company records losses and loss expenses based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses the company expects to be reported on policies and contracts written 
the ultimate losses and loss expenses will depend on the actual costs to settle claims 
acquisition expenses consist principally of commissions and brokerage expenses that are typically a percentage of the premiums on successful insurance policies or reinsurance contracts written 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and general operating expenses 
marketplace conditions and trends 
in general  at the end of  we believe operating conditions continued to be competitive 
in most classes of property and casualty business  we experienced neutral to downward pricing driven largely by relatively high levels of underwriting capacity and competition 
in the catastrophe exposed property business  we experienced pricing increase on international and peak zone exposures underwritten due to the recent high level of worldwide catastrophe losses and from changes to catastrophe risk management models commonly used in the industry 
in our agriculture business  pricing was stable  although the underlying exposure base increased with the rise in commodity prices 
we continued to maintain our adherence to underwriting standards by declining business when pricing  terms and conditions did not meet our underwriting criteria 
in  we believe the following five primary influences may affect the market for our insurance and reinsurance products the continuation of the challenging global economy  continued pricing competition in many of our markets  increased volatility in agriculture commodity prices  the high level of global catastrophe losses incurred by the industry  and a low interest rate environment 
the united states and other markets around the world have continued to experience unsettled economic conditions  including high levels of unemployment  significant governmental regulation initiatives and continued uncertainty in global financial markets 
although economies are slowly recovering  the lower levels of economic activity are likely to continue to suppress growth in demand for insurance and reinsurance 
this is likely to result in a continued competitive global insurance and reinsurance market in potentially offsetting these factors is the increased volatility of agriculture commodity prices which could lead to increased risk exposure and higher demand in our agriculture insurance business 
in addition  the high level of global catastrophe losses incurred by the industry in and will likely result in increased prices for catastrophe exposed property insurance and reinsurance in lastly  the current low interest rate environment will likely encourage a lower appetite for risks that are not adequately priced as there will be reduced investment earnings from underwriting cash flows 
at this time  the company cannot predict with any reasonable certainty whether and to what extent current marketplace conditions and trends will persist in the future 
critical accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective in nature and require management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine the reported values and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
if factors such as those described in the risk factors section in this annual report on form k cause actual events or results to differ materially from management s underlying assumptions or estimates  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect significant estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents premiums 
the company s insurance premiums are earned pro rata over the terms of the applicable risk period specified in the insurance policy 
the company s insurance policies are written on a losses occurring or claims made basis during the term of the policy 
generally  the company receives a fixed premium which is identified in the policy and is recorded on the inception date of the contract or when premiums are determinable and earned evenly over the policy term 
this premium will only adjust if the underlying insured basis adjusts 
accordingly  we monitor the underlying insured basis and record additional or return premiums in the period in which amounts are reasonably determinable 
insurance premiums written accounted for   and of the company s gross premiums written during the years ended december    and  respectively 
the company s reinsurance premiums are earned in proportion to the amount of reinsurance protection provided over the terms of the applicable risk period established in the reinsurance contract 
reinsurance contracts written on a losses occurring basis cover losses which occur during the term of the reinsurance contract  typically months 
accordingly  the company earns the premium on a losses occurring reinsurance contract evenly over the reinsurance contract term 
losses occurring reinsurance contracts accounted for approximately   and of the company s gross premiums written during the years ended december    and  respectively 
reinsurance contracts written on a policies attaching basis cover losses from the underlying insurance policies incepting during the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
losses under a policies attaching reinsurance contract may occur after the end date of the reinsurance contract  so long as they are losses from policies which began during the reinsurance contract period 
the company typically earns the premiums for policies attaching reinsurance contracts over a month period in proportion to the amount of reinsurance protection provided to reflect the extension of the risk period past the term of the contract and the varying levels of reinsurance protection provided during the reinsurance contract period 
policies attaching reinsurance contracts accounted for approximately   and of the company s gross premiums written during the years ended december    and  respectively 
in addition to determining the applicable risk period  the company s estimate of its reinsurance premiums written is based on the type of reinsurance contracts underwritten 
for excess of loss reinsurance contracts  the deposit premium  as defined in the contract  is generally considered to be the best estimate of the reinsurance contract s written premium at inception 
the company earns reinstatement premiums upon the occurrence of a loss under the reinsurance contract 
reinstatement premiums are calculated in accordance with the contract terms based upon the ultimate loss estimate associated with each contract 
excess of loss reinsurance contracts accounted for approximately   and of the company s gross premiums written during the years ended december    and  respectively 
for proportional reinsurance contracts  the company estimates premiums  commissions and related expenses based on broker and ceding company estimates 
in addition to ceding company estimates  the company also utilizes its judgment in establishing proportional reinsurance contract premium estimates after considering the following factors the ceding company s historical premium versus projected premium  the ceding company s history of providing accurate estimates  anticipated changes in the marketplace and the ceding company s competitive position therein  reported premiums to date  and correspondence and communication between the company and its brokers  intermediaries and ceding companies 
proportional reinsurance contracts accounted for approximately   and of the company s gross premiums written during the years ended december    and  respectively 
premiums on the company s excess of loss and proportional reinsurance contracts are estimated by management at the time the business is underwritten 
accordingly  this is the amount the company records as written premium in the period the contracts incept 
as actual premiums are reported by the ceding companies  management evaluates the appropriateness of the original premium estimates and any adjustment to these estimates is recorded in the period in which it becomes known 
the company has not historically experienced material adjustments to its initial premium estimates for its excess of loss reinsurance contracts 
for proportional contracts  as is customary in the reinsurance market  there is a time lag from the point when premium and related commission and expense activity is recorded by a ceding company to the point when such information is reported by the ceding company to the company  either directly or through a reinsurance intermediary 
this time lag can vary from one to several months or calendar quarters 
in addition  uncertainty in premium estimates arises due to changes in renewal rates or rate of new business acceptances by the cedant insurance companies and changes in the rates being charged by cedants 
changes to original premium estimates for proportional contracts could be material and such adjustments may directly and significantly impact earnings in the period they are determined because the subject premium may be fully or substantially earned 
the company s historical experience has shown that estimated premiums from proportional contracts have varied and have been adjusted by up to approximately  although larger variations  both positive and negative  are possible as a result of changes in one or more of the premium assumptions as noted above 
an variation in the company s proportional premiums receivable  net as of december   after considering the related expected losses and loss expenses  acquisition expenses and taxes  would result in an impact of approximately million on the company s net income 

table of contents the following summarizes the company s net proportional premium estimates within premiums receivable  net on the company s audited consolidated balance sheet as of december  and september  september  september  september  september  surety aerospace and other classes of coverage casualty property and marine specialty total us dollars in thousands as of december  proportional premiums receivable  net as of december  proportional premiums receivable  net as a result of recognizing the estimated gross premium written at the inception of the policy and collecting that premium over an extended period  we include a premiums receivable asset on our balance sheet 
we actively monitor our premiums receivable asset to consider whether we need an allowance for doubtful accounts 
as part of this process  we consider the credit quality of our cedants and monitor premium receipts versus expectations 
at december   the company has an allowance for estimated uncollectible premiums receivable of million million 
reserve for losses and loss expenses 
the company s reserve for losses and loss expenses includes case reserves and reserves for losses incurred but not reported referred to as ibnr reserves 
case reserves are established for losses that have been reported to us  but not yet paid 
ibnr reserves represent the estimated ultimate cost of events or conditions that have not been reported to or specifically identified by the company  but have occurred 
case reserves and ibnr reserves are established by management based on reports from reinsurance intermediaries  ceding companies and insureds and consultations with independent legal counsel 
in addition  ibnr reserves are established by management based on reported losses and loss expenses and actuarially determined estimates of ultimate losses and loss expenses 
under us gaap  the company is not permitted to establish loss reserves until the occurrence of an actual loss event 
once such an event occurs  the company establishes reserves based upon estimates of total losses incurred by the ceding companies or insureds as a result of the event  its estimate of the potential losses incurred  and its estimate of the portion of such loss the company has insured or reinsured 
as a result  only loss reserves applicable to losses incurred up to the financial statement date may be recorded  with no allowance for the provision of a contingency reserve to account for expected future losses 
losses arising from future events will be estimated and recognized at the time the loss is incurred and could be substantial 
see reserve for losses and loss expenses below for further discussion 
the company s loss and loss expense reserves are reviewed regularly  and adjustments  if any  are reflected in earnings in the period in which they become known 
the establishment of new loss and loss expense reserves or the adjustment of previously recorded loss and loss expense reserves could result in significant positive or negative changes to the company s financial condition for any particular period 
while we believe that we have made a reasonable estimate of loss and loss expense reserves  the ultimate loss experience may not be as reliably predicted as may be the case with other insurance and reinsurance operations  and it is possible that losses and loss expenses will be higher or lower than the total reserve for losses and loss expenses recorded by the company 
information used in determining the reserve for losses and loss expenses 
in order to estimate the company s reserve for losses and loss expenses  management uses information either developed from internal or independent external sources  or pricing information created by the company or provided to the company by insureds and brokers at the time individual contracts and policies are bound 
in addition  we use commercially available risk analysis models  contract by contract review by our underwriting teams and  to a limited extent  overall market share assumptions to estimate our loss and loss expense reserves related to specific loss events 
actuarial methods used to estimate loss and loss expense reserves 
when the applicable information has been obtained  the company uses a variety of actuarial methods to estimate the ultimate losses and loss expenses incurred by the company in connection with business it has underwritten and thus  the applicable reserve for losses and loss expenses 
one actuarial method used by the company to estimate its reserve for losses and loss expenses is the expected loss ratio approach  which is based on expected results independent of current loss reporting activity 
this approach is typically used for immature loss periods ie  the current accident year 
another actuarial method used by the company is known as the bornhuetter ferguson method 
the bornhuetter ferguson method uses an initial loss estimate expected loss technique for each underwriting quarter by business line and type of contract 
the portion of the initial loss estimate that is the ibnr reserve is then reduced in each subsequent quarter by the losses reported for that business segment during that quarter 
over time  the ibnr reserve will be reduced and will be replaced with the actual losses reported to the company or  if losses do not develop as expected  reserves for those losses are reduced with the amounts by which reserves are reduced then reflected in net income 
management uses these multiple actuarial methods  supplemented with its own professional judgment  to establish its best estimate of reserves for losses and loss expenses 

table of contents the information gathered by the company and the actuarial analyses performed on the gathered information is used to develop individual point estimates of carried loss and loss expense reserves for each of the company s business segments and underlying lines of business 
these individual point estimates are then aggregated along with actual losses reported to reach the total reserve for losses and loss expenses carried on the company s consolidated financial statements 
all of the company s loss reserving is currently performed on a point estimate basis 
the company does not utilize range estimation in its loss reserving process 
since inception  the company has used reserving methods that are commonly applied when limited loss development experience exists 
in order to capture the key dynamics of loss development and expected volatility that may arise within the disclosed amounts for the reserve for losses and loss expenses  the key lines of business within each business segment are aggregated based on their potential expected length of loss emergence 
the period over which loss emergence occurs is typically referred to as the tail 
the company has classified its lines of business as either having a short  long or other tail pattern 
as the company has accumulated its own loss reserve history  it has determined it is more appropriate to incorporate the company s actual loss experience 
as of  the company determined that its own loss development history in relation to its short tail and other lines of business had reached a level of maturity sufficient to provide a credible basis on which to estimate its reserve for losses and loss expenses related to these lines of buinsess 
as such  the company s actual reporting patterns were considered when determining the reserve for losses and loss expenses in the short tail and other lines of business in its reinsurance and insurance segments for the year ended december  the company continues to utilize industry loss and development patterns in the establishment of loss and loss expense reserves for its long tail and certain other lines of business in both its insurance and reinsurance segments 
significant assumptions employed in the estimation of loss and loss expense reserves 
the most significant assumptions used as of december  to estimate the reserve for losses and loss expenses within the company s insurance and reinsurance segments are as follows the information developed from internal and independent external sources can be used to develop meaningful estimates of the likely future performance of business bound by the company  the loss and exposure information provided by ceding companies  insureds and brokers in support of their submissions can be used to derive meaningful estimates of the likely future performance of business bound with respect to each contract and policy  historic loss development and trend experience is assumed to be indicative of future loss development and trends  and no significant emergence of losses or types of losses that are not represented in the information supplied to the company by its brokers  ceding companies and insureds will occur 
the above four assumptions most significantly influence the company s determination of initial expected loss ratios and expected loss reporting patterns that are the key inputs which impact potential variability in the estimate of the reserve for losses and loss expenses and are applicable to each of the company s business segments 
while there can be no assurance that any of the above assumptions will prove to be correct  we believe that these assumptions represent a realistic and appropriate basis for estimating the reserve for losses and loss expenses 
factors creating uncertainty in the estimation of the reserve for losses and loss expenses 
while management does not at this time include an explicit or implicit provision for uncertainty in its reserve for losses and loss expenses  certain of the company s business lines are by their nature subject to additional uncertainties  including the company s casualty  property  catastrophe  aerospace and marine and surety and other specialty lines in the reinsurance segment and the company s casualty and professional lines in the insurance segment  which are discussed in detail below 
in addition  the company s reinsurance segment is subject to additional factors which add to the uncertainty of estimating loss and loss expense reserves 
time lags in the reporting of losses can also introduce further ambiguity to the process of estimating loss and loss expense reserves 
the aspects of the company s casualty line in the reinsurance segment and the casualty and professional lines in the insurance segment that complicate the process of estimating loss reseves include the lack of long term historical data for losses of the same type intended to be covered by the policies and contracts written by the company and the expectation that a portion of losses in excess of the company s attachment levels in many of its contracts will be low in frequency and high in severity  limiting the usefulness of claims experience of other insurers and reinsurers for similar claims 
in addition  the portion of the company s casualty line in its insurance segment which is underwritten in bermuda includes policy forms that vary from more traditional policy forms 
the primary difference in the casualty policy form used by endurance bermuda from more traditional policy forms relates to the coverage being provided on an occurrence reported basis instead of the typical occurrence or claims made basis used in traditional policy forms 
the occurrence reported policy forms typically cover occurrences causing unexpected and unintended personal injury or property damage to third parties arising from events or conditions that commence at or subsequent to an inception date  and prior to the expiration of the policy provided that proper notice is given during the term of the policy or the discovery period 
the inherent uncertainty of estimating the company s loss and loss expense reserves for its reinsurance segment increases principally due to the lag in time between the time claims are reported to the ceding company and the time they are reported through one or more reinsurance broker intermediaries to the company  
table of contents the differing reserving practices among ceding companies  the diversity of loss development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or contracts  and the company s need to rely on its ceding companies for loss information 
in order to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information provided to the company by its ceding company counterparties  the company s underwriters  actuaries  accounting and claims personnel perform underwriting and claims reviews of the company s ceding companies 
any material findings are communicated to the ceding companies and utilized in the establishment or revision of the company s case reserves and related ibnr reserves 
on occasion  these reviews reveal that the ceding company s reported losses and loss expenses do not comport with the terms of the contract with the company 
in such events  the company strives to resolve the outstanding differences in an amicable fashion 
the large majority of such differences are resolved in this manner 
in the infrequent instance where an amicable solution is not feasible  the company s policy is to vigorously defend its position in litigation or arbitration 
as of december   the company was not involved in any material claims litigation or arbitration proceedings 
due to the large volume of potential transactions that must be recorded in the insurance and reinsurance industry  backlogs in the recording of the company s business activities can also impair the accuracy of its loss and loss expense reserve estimates 
as of december   there were no significant backlogs related to the processing of policy or contract information in the company s insurance or reinsurance segments 
the company assumes in its loss and loss expense reserving process that  on average  the time periods between the recording of expected losses and the reporting of actual losses are predictable when measured in the aggregate and over time 
the time period over which all losses are expected to be reported to the company varies significantly by line of business 
this period can range from a few quarters for some lines  such as catastrophe  to many years for some casualty lines of business 
for the company s reinsurance business segment  due to ceding company and reinsurance intermediary reporting frequency  the time period is generally longer than for its insurance segment  resulting in a reliance by the company for a longer period of time on its actuarial estimates of loss and loss expense reserves 
to the extent that actual reported losses are reported more quickly than expected  the company may adjust upward its estimate of ultimate loss and to the extent that actual reported losses are reported more slowly than expected  the company may reduce its estimate of ultimate loss 
potential volatility in the reserve for losses and loss expenses 
in addition to the factors creating uncertainty in the company s estimate of loss and loss expense reserves  the company s estimated reserve for losses and loss expenses can change over time because of unexpected changes in the external environment 
potential changing external factors include changes in the inflation rate for goods and services related to the covered damages  changes in the general economic environment that could cause unanticipated changes in claim frequency or severity  changes in the litigation environment regarding the representation of plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs  changes in the judicial and or arbitration environment regarding the interpretation of policy and contract provisions relating to the determination of coverage and or the amount of damages awarded for certain types of claims  changes in the social environment regarding the general attitude of juries in the determination of liability and damages  changes in the legislative environment regarding the definition of damages  new types of injuries caused by new types of injurious activities or exposures  and in the case of assumed reinsurance  changes in ceding company case reserving and reporting patterns 
the company s estimates of reserves for losses and loss expenses can also change over time because of changes in internal company operations  such as alterations in claims handling procedures  growth in new lines of business where exposure and loss development patterns are not well established  or changes in the quality of risk selection or pricing in the underwriting process 
due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used in establishing the company s loss and loss expense reserve estimates  final claim settlements made by the company may vary significantly from the present estimates  particularly when those settlements may not occur until well into the future 
for an illustration of the effect of a change in the company s two key inputs used in determining its loss and loss expense reserves the expected loss ratio and the expected loss reporting pattern please see reserve for losses and loss expenses below 

table of contents investments 
the company currently classifies its fixed maturity investments  short term investments and equity securities  as available for sale and  accordingly  they are carried at estimated fair value  with related net unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company determines the fair value of its fixed maturity  short term and equity investments in accordance with current accounting guidance  which defines fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy based on inputs to the various valuation techniques used for each fair value measurement 
the use of valuation techniques for any given investment requires a significant amount of judgment and consideration of factors specific to the underlying investment 
fair value measurements determined by the company seek to maximize observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
current accounting guidance establishes three levels as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level quoted prices for similar assets in markets that are active  quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other than quoted prices in level  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
unobservable inputs reflect the company s own views about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
level assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies  or similar techniques  as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
the company determines the estimated fair value of each individual security utilizing the highest level inputs available 
the company uses quoted values and other data provided by nationally recognized independent pricing sources as inputs into its process for determining fair values of its fixed maturity  short term and equity portfolios 
the company obtains multiple prices for its securities where available 
pricing sources used in pricing the company s fixed maturity  short term and equity portfolios at december  were as follows september  pricing services index providers broker dealers pricing services and index providers 
pricing services  including index providers  provide pricing for less complex  liquid securities based on market quotations in active markets 
for securities that do not trade on a listed exchange  these pricing services may use a matrix pricing consisting of observable market inputs to estimate the fair value of a security 
these observable market inputs include reported trades  benchmark yields  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers  reference data  and industry and economic factors 
additionally  pricing services may use a valuation model such as an option adjusted spread model commonly used for estimating fair values of mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
at december   the company has not adjusted any pricing provided by independent pricing services and index providers and have classified all such securities as level broker dealers 
generally  the company obtains quotes directly from broker dealers who are active in the corresponding markets when prices are unavailable from independent pricing services or index providers 
broker dealer quotes may also be used if the pricing from pricing services or index providers is not reflective of current market levels  as detected by our pricing control tolerance procedures 
generally  broker dealers value securities through their trading desks based on observable market inputs 
their pricing methodologies include mapping securities based on trade data  bids or offers  observed spreads and performance on newly issued securities 
they may also establish pricing through observing secondary trading of similar securities 
quotes from broker dealers are all non binding 
at december   the company has not adjusted any pricing provided by broker dealers and has classified all such securities as level as described above  independent pricing services  index providers and broker dealers have their own method for determining the fair value of securities 
as such  prices provided by independent pricing services  index providers and independent broker quotes can vary widely  even for the same security  and may have a material effect on the estimated fair values of the company s securities 
if the company determines that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of trading activity for the securities in relation to the normal market activity for such security or similar securities  then transactions or quoted prices may not accurately reflect fair value and  if there is evidence that the transaction for the security is not orderly  the company may place less weight on the transaction price as an indicator of fair value 
to validate the techniques or models used by pricing sources  the company s review process includes  but is not limited to quantitative analysis eg  comparing the quarterly return for each managed portfolio to its target benchmark  with significant differences identified and investigated  initial and ongoing evaluation of methodologies used by outside parties to calculate fair value  and comparing the fair value estimates to its knowledge of the current market 

table of contents other than temporary impairment 
following a determination of fair value  the company reviews its fixed maturity  short term and equity portfolios to determine whether any declines in the fair value below the amortized cost basis of its fixed maturity  short term and equity portfolios are other than temporary 
if the company determines that a decision to sell the security has been made or that it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security  the company deems the security to be other than temporarily impaired and writes it down to fair value  thereby establishing a new cost basis 
the amount of the write down is recognized in earnings as an other than temporary impairment otti loss 
for the remaining fixed maturity and short term investments in an unrealized loss position for which a decision to sell has not been made and it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell  the company performs additional reviews to determine whether the investment will recover its amortized cost 
if the amortized cost of the company s fixed maturity and short term investments is  based upon the judgment of management  unlikely to be recovered  the company writes down the investment by the amount representing the credit related portion of the decline in value  thereby establishing a new cost basis 
the amount of the write down is recognized in earnings as an otti loss 
the new cost basis is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
to the extent the company determines that the amortized cost of the company s fixed maturity and short term investments is likely to be recovered and related to non credit factors such as interest rates  market conditions  etc 
and not due to credit related factors  that remaining non credit portion of the unrealized loss is recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of the company s balance sheet 
for equity securities in an unrealized loss position for which a decision to sell has not been made and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the equity security  the company considers its ability and intent to hold an equity security in an unrealized loss position for a reasonable period of time to allow for a full recovery 
when the company determines that the decline in value of an equity security is other than temporary  the company reduces the cost of the equity security to its fair value and recognizes the loss in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
the new cost basis is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
other investments 
other investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting whereby the initial investment is recorded at cost 
other investments consist of alternative funds and specialty funds 
alternative funds include investments in hedge funds and private equity funds that generally invest in senior secured bank debt  high yield debt securities  distressed debt  distressed real estate  derivatives and equity long short strategies 
specialty funds currently include high yield loan and convertible debt funds 
the carrying value of these investments are increased or decreased to reflect the company s share of income or loss  which is included in net investment income  and are decreased for dividends 
due to the timing of the delivery of the final valuations reported by certain of the fund managers  valuations of certain alternative funds and specialty funds are estimated based on the most recently available information  including period end valuation statements  period end estimates  or  in some cases  prior month or quarter valuation statements 
goodwill 
the company is required to make an annual assessment as to whether the value of the company s goodwill asset is impaired 
impairment  which can be either partial or full  is based on a fair value analysis by individual reporting unit 
based upon the company s assessment at the reporting unit level  there was no impairment of its goodwill asset of million as of december  in making an assessment of the value of its goodwill  the company uses both market based and non market based valuations 
assumptions underlying these valuations include forecasts of discounted future cash flows and future profits in addition to an analysis of the company s stock price relative to both its book value and its net income 
significant changes in the data underlying these assumptions could result in an assessment of impairment of the company s goodwill asset 
in addition  if the current economic environment and or the company s financial performance were to deteriorate significantly  this could lead to an impairment of goodwill  the write off of which would be recorded against net income in the period such deterioration occurred 
if a decline in the fair value of the reporting units occurred  this would not result in an impairment of the goodwill asset at december  deferred tax assets 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of the relevant accounting guidance on  accounting for income taxes and accounting for uncertain tax positions for endurance reinsurance  endurance american  endurance american specialty  endurance risk solutions  armtech and endurance uk  which are our operating subsidiaries in income tax paying jurisdictions 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from the net tax effect of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our audited consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction 

table of contents at each balance sheet date  management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction and available tax planning strategies 
estimates of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions that may differ from actual experience 
differences in our assumptions and resulting estimates could be material and have an adverse impact on our financial results of operations and liquidity 
any such differences are recorded in the period in which they become known 
as of december   the company had a net deferred income tax asset of million million  which includes a valuation allowance of million million

net losses and loss expenses the company s reported net losses and loss expenses are characterized by various factors and are significantly impacted by the occurrence or absence of catastrophic events and subsequent loss emergence related to such events 
in  multiple events adversely affected the company s net loss ratio in the reinsurance segment 
these included thailand floods  hurricane irene  danish floods  brushfires in texas  the tohuko  japan earthquake and tsunami  the christchurch  new zealand earthquake  queensland  australia floods  midwest united states tornadoes and multiple storms in the midwest which when accumulated triggered certain aggregate catastrophe contracts 
the company recorded losses  net of reinsurance  reinstatement premiums and other loss sensitive accruals  of million in relation to these events which added percentage points to the company s net loss ratio for the year ended december  for the twelve months ended december   the chilean earthquake  the new zealand earthquake and european windstorm xynthia adversely affected the company s net loss ratio in the reinsurance segment 
the company recorded losses  net of reinstatement premiums and other loss sensitive accruals  of million in relation to the three events  which added percentage points to the company s net loss ratio for in  the company s net loss ratio benefited from a relative absence of major catastrophes 
additionally  the company recorded higher reserves for attritional losses in the insurance segment s agriculture and property lines in the year ended december  compared to which were partially offset by lower losses in the casualty line where a small number of individual risk events impacted results in the higher reserves in the agriculture line of business were due to drought conditions experienced in the southwest united states and excess moisture in the midwest united states in the spring  and the higher reserves in the property line of business was due to several small loss events related to storms and flooding 
the company recorded higher reserves for attritional losses in the insurance segment s property and healthcare lines in the year ended december  compared to during  and  the company s previously estimated ultimate losses for prior accident years were reduced by million  million and million  respectively  as the loss emergence related to prior accident years was lower than expected  resulting in the reserves held by the company for those accident years being redundant 
the overall net reduction in the company s estimated losses for prior accident years experienced in emerged in the company s short tail  long tail and other lines of both the insurance and reinsurance segments 
the company participates in lines of business where claims may not be reported for many years 
accordingly  management does not believe that reported claims are the only valid means for estimating ultimate obligations 
ultimate losses and loss expenses may differ materially from the amounts recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are reviewed regularly and  as experience develops and new information becomes known  the reserves are adjusted as necessary 
as a result of the 
table of contents incorporation of the company s own loss reporting patterns and loss history related to its short tail business  including catastrophe reinsurance and property insurance and reinsurance business lines  the company would expect its prior year loss reserve development and adjustments for short tail business to be less than recorded in prior years 
reserve adjustments  if any  are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined 
the overall loss reserves were established by the company s actuaries and reflect management s best estimate of ultimate losses 
see reserve for losses and loss expenses below for further discussion 
acquisition expenses the company s acquisition expense ratio decreased in as compared to and primarily due to shifts in the earned premium mix  notably within the insurance segment as earned premiums have increased in the agriculture line which has lower related acquisition costs than other lines 
additionally  the company exited the workers compensation line of business within the insurance segment during which had higher commission rates than other lines 
general and administrative expenses the company s general and administrative expense ratio for was comparable to that of as higher net earned premiums offset increased expenditures 
the general and administrative ratio in was lower than that of as the impact of higher net earned premiums outweighed an increase in expenditures 
the increase in expenditures in compared to and was due to higher personnel costs resulting from increased headcount  increased facilities costs and increased professional service fees related to information systems consulting 
at december   the company had a total of employees as compared to employees at december  and employees at december  income tax benefit expense the company incurred a tax benefit for the year ended december  of million compared to tax expense of million and benefit of million for the years ended december  and the company incurred a higher tax benefit in due to an increase in net losses experienced in its united states taxable jurisdictions compared to and net loss income the company produced a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in and million in primarily due to the increase in catastrophe losses experienced in the current year and from lower net investment income 
underwriting results by business segment the determination of the company s business segments is based on the manner in which management monitors the performance of the company s underwriting operations 
as a result  we report two business segments insurance and reinsurance 
management measures the company s results on the basis of the combined ratio  which is obtained by dividing the sum of the losses and loss expenses  acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses by net premiums earned 
the company s historic combined ratios may not be indicative of future underwriting performance 
when purchased within a single line of business  ceded reinsurance and recoveries are accounted for within that line of business 
when purchased across multiple lines of business  ceded reinsurance and recoveries are allocated to the lines of business in proportion to the related risks assumed 
the company does not manage its assets by business segment  accordingly  investment income and total assets are not allocated to the individual business segments 
general and administrative expenses incurred by business segments are allocated directly 
remaining general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments are allocated primarily based on estimated consumption  headcount and other variables deemed relevant to the allocation of such expenses 
ceded reinsurance and recoveries are recorded within the segment to which they apply

endurance holdings received net proceeds of million from its offering of series a preferred shares and million from its offering of series b preferred shares  in each case after expenses and underwriting discounts 
the proceeds from both offerings were used to provide additional capital to endurance holdings subsidiaries and for other general corporate purposes 

table of contents the series a preferred shares and series b preferred shares have no stated maturity date and are redeemable in whole or in part at the option of endurance holdings any time after december  in the case of the series a preferred shares and after june  in the case of the series b preferred shares in each case at a redemption price of per share plus any declared and unpaid dividends  without accumulation of any undeclared dividends 
endurance holdings may redeem all but not less than all of the series a preferred shares or series b preferred shares before their respective redemption dates at a redemption price of per share  plus any declared and unpaid dividends  to the date of redemption  if endurance holdings is required to submit a proposal to the holders of the series a preferred shares or series b preferred shares concerning an amalgamation  consolidation  merger  similar corporate transaction or change in bermuda law 
dividends on the series a preferred shares and series b preferred shares  when  as and if declared by the board of directors of endurance holdings or a duly authorized committee of the board  accrue and are payable on the liquidation preference amount from the original issue date  quarterly in arrears on each dividend payment date  at an annual rate of in the case of the series a preferred shares and an annual rate of in the case of the series b preferred shares 
dividends on the series a preferred shares and series b preferred shares are not cumulative 
upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation  dissolution or winding up of endurance holdings  holders of the series a preferred shares  series b preferred shares and any parity shares are entitled to receive out of endurance holdings assets available for distribution to shareholders  before any distribution is made to holders of endurance holdings common equity securities  a liquidating distribution in the amount of per series a preferred share and series b preferred share  plus any declared and unpaid dividends  without accumulation of any undeclared dividends 
distributions will be made pro rata as to the series a preferred shares  series b preferred shares and any parity shares and only to the extent of endurance holdings assets  if any  that are available after satisfaction of all liabilities to creditors 
in conjunction with the issuance by the company of the series a preferred shares  the company entered into a declaration of covenant for the benefit of the holders of the senior notes 
the covenant states that the company will redeem its series a preferred shares only if the total redemption price is less than or equal to the proceeds endurance holdings or its subsidiaries have received during the six months prior to the date of such redemption from the sale of certain qualifying securities that  among other things  are  with limited exceptions  pari passu with or junior to the series a preferred shares upon the company s liquidation  dissolution or winding up  perpetual  or have a mandatory redemption or maturity date that is not less than sixty years after the initial issuance of such securities  and provide for dividends or other income distributions that are non cumulative

on an ongoing basis  the company expects its internally generated funds  together with borrowings available under the credit facility  capital generated from the offering and sale of its senior notes  series a preferred shares  series b preferred shares and ordinary shares  to be sufficient to operate its business 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity or hybrid securities in order to implement its business strategy or pay claims 
currency and foreign exchange the company s functional currencies are us dollars for its us and bermuda operations and british sterling for its uk operations 
the reporting currency for all entities is us dollars 
the company maintains a portion of its investments and liabilities in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company has made a significant investment in the capitalization of endurance u 
k which was valued at million as of december  endurance uk is subject to the united kingdom s financial services authority rules concerning the matching of the currency of its assets to the currency of its liabilities 
depending on the profile of endurance uk s liabilities  it may be required to hold some of its assets in currencies corresponding to the currencies of its liabilities 
the company may  from time to time  experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
assets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currency is not the us dollar are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses of such foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates during the year 
the effect of the translation adjustments for foreign operations is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are revalued at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date with the resulting foreign exchange gains and losses included in earnings 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the transaction date 

table of contents for the year ended december   of the company s gross premiums were written in currencies other than the us dollar 
the portions of our cash and cash equivalents  investments and reserves for loss and loss expenses denominated in non us currencies at december  were approximately  and  respectively 
as of december   the company s principal foreign currency exposures are denominated in japanese yen and british sterling 
the company measures and manages its exposure in these currencies  among others  by monitoring its estimated gross and net asset positions 
in order to estimate such exposures  the company considers currency specific investments  cash and cash equivalents  premiums receivable  reserve for losses and loss expenses  and unearned premiums 
the total estimated gross asset and net liability balances denominated in japanese yen were million and million  respectively 
the total estimated gross and net asset balances denominated in british sterling were million and million  respectively 
assuming all other variables are held constant and disregarding any tax effects  a change in the us dollar relative to these currencies could result in a million increase or decrease in the net assets held by the company at december  effects of inflation the effects of inflation could cause the severity of claims to rise in the future 
the company s estimates for losses and loss expenses include assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims  the company will be required to increase the reserve for losses and loss expenses with a corresponding reduction in its earnings in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
in addition  inflation could lead to higher interest rates causing the current unrealized gain position on the company s fixed maturity portfolio to decrease 
the current short duration of the company s fixed maturity portfolio has the potential to help reduce the negative effects of higher interest rates on the company s fixed income portfolio 
the company may also choose to hold its fixed maturity portfolio to maturity which would result in the unrealized gains largely amortizing through net investment income 
reserve for losses and loss expenses reserving process the company establishes loss and loss expense reserves to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies and reinsurance contracts underwritten by the company 
these reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims and claim adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process 
this estimation process is based largely on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events and involves a variety of actuarial techniques and judgments that analyze experience  trends and other relevant factors 
the company s reserving actuaries  who are independent of the company s business units  review the company s loss and loss expense reserves on a quarterly basis for both current and prior accident years using the most current claims data 
these reserve reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods and judgments  including the three most common methods of actuarial evaluation used within the insurance industry the expected loss ratio method  the bornhuetter ferguson method  and the loss development method 
the expected loss ratio approach is based on expected results independent of current loss reporting activity 
this approach is typically used for immature loss periods ie  the current accident year 
the bornhuetter ferguson method involves the application of selected loss ratios to the company s earned premiums to determine estimates of ultimate expected unpaid claims and claims expenses for each underwriting year 
when the ibnr reserves are added to the losses and loss expenses amounts with respect to claims that have been reported to date  an estimated ultimate expected loss results 
the company believes that this method provides a more stable estimate of ibnr reserves that is insulated from wide variations in reported losses 
in contrast  the loss development method extrapolates the current value of reported losses to ultimate expected losses by using selected reporting patterns of losses over time 
the selected reporting patterns are based on historical information organized into loss development triangles and are adjusted to reflect the changing characteristics of the book of business written by the company 
the company uses these multiple methods  supplemented with its own actuarial and professional judgment  to establish its best estimate of loss and loss expense reserves 
the estimate of the reserve for losses and loss expenses is reviewed each quarter by the company s loss reserve committee  consisting of the company s chief executive officer  president  chief financial officer  chief actuary and representatives of various disciplines from within the company  such as claims  underwriting and legal 
current reserve for losses and loss expenses in order to capture the key dynamics of loss development and expected volatility that may arise within the disclosed amounts for the reserve for losses and loss expenses  the key lines of business within each business segment are aggregated based on their potential expected length of loss emergence 
the period over which loss emergence occurs is typically referred to as the tail 
the company has classified its lines of business as either having a short  long or other tail pattern 
the company views short tail business as that for which development typically emerges within a period of several quarters while long tail business would emerge over many years 
the company s short tail lines of business in the insurance segment includes property  long tail lines of business include casualty  healthcare liability  professional lines and surety and other specialty  and other tail lines of business include certain specialty lines of business for which loss emergence is considered unique in nature  such as the company s agriculture insurance 
table of contents business 
the company s short tail lines of business in the reinsurance segment include catastrophe  property  aerospace and marine and surety while the long tail line of business is casualty related business 
within the company s reinsurance segment  the company writes certain specialty lines of business for which the loss emergence is considered unique in nature and thus  has been included as other in the table below 
as more fully described under reserving process above  the company incorporates a variety of actuarial methods and judgments in its reserving process 
two key inputs in the various actuarial methods employed by the company are initial expected loss ratios and expected loss reporting patterns 
these key inputs impact the potential variability in the estimate of the reserve for losses and loss expenses and are applicable to each of the company s business segments 
the company s loss and loss expense reserves consider and reflect  in part  deviations resulting from differences between expected loss and actual loss reporting as well as judgments relating to the weights applied to the reserve levels indicated by the actuarial methods 
expected loss reporting patterns are based upon internal and external historical data and assumptions regarding claims reporting trends over a period of time that extends beyond the company s own operating history 
differences between actual reported losses and expected losses are anticipated to occur in any individual period and such deviations may influence future initial expected loss ratios and or expected loss reporting patterns as recent actual experience becomes part of the historical data utilized as part of the ongoing reserve estimation process 
the company has demonstrated the impact of changes in the speed of loss reporting patterns  as well as changes in expected loss ratios  within the table under the heading potential variability in reserves for losses and loss expenses below 
losses and loss expenses for the year ended december  are summarized as follows september  september  september  incurred related to total incurred current year prior years losses us dollars in thousands insurance segment short tail long tail other total insurance reinsurance segment short tail long tail other total reinsurance totals losses and loss expenses for the year ended december  include million in favorable development of reserves relating to prior accident years 
the favorable loss reserve development experienced during the year benefited the company s reported loss ratio by approximately percentage points 
the net reduction in estimated losses for prior accident years reflects lower than expected loss emergence in each of the company s reserve categories within both the insurance and reinsurance segments 
for the year ended december   for the vast majority of our business  the company did not materially alter the two key inputs it utilizes to establish its reserve for losses and loss expenses  initial expected loss ratios or loss reporting patterns  for business related to prior years for the insurance and reinsurance reserve categories as the variances in reported losses in for those reserve categories were within the range of possible results anticipated by the company 
insurance short tail insurance 
the favorable loss emergence within the short tail insurance reserve category during was primarily due to lower than expected claims reported and favorable case reserve development related to the property line of business 
long tail insurance 
the favorable loss emergence within the long tail insurance reserve category during was primarily due to lower than expected claims activity within the bermuda based healthcare liability  casualty and professional lines of business 
this favorable loss emergence was partially offset by adverse development within the us based workers compensation line of business which the company exited in as well as other us based casualty business 

table of contents other insurance 
the favorable loss emergence within this reserve category resulted from lower than anticipated agriculture claims settlements for the crop year

for the insurance workers compensation line of business we increased our prior initial expected loss ratios and for the bermuda based healthcare insurance line we decreased our prior initial expected loss ratios to recognize the emerging loss experience within those lines 
insurance short tail insurance 
the prior year favorable loss development in the short tail insurance reserve category during was primarily as a result of lower than expected claims reported and favorable case reserve development in the company s property line of business 
as a result  the company reduced its estimated losses and loss expenses related to prior years in this reserve category during long tail insurance 
the favorable loss emergence within the long tail insurance reserve category during was primarily due to lower than expected claims activity and favorable case settlement within the bermuda based healthcare liability  casualty and professional lines of business

table of contents potential variability in reserves for losses and loss expenses the company s estimated reserve for losses and loss expenses can change over time because of unexpected changes in the external business environment in which the company operates or changes in internal company operations 
for a discussion of the factors which can contribute to uncertainty in the reserving process and volatility in the reserve for losses and loss expenses  see critical accounting estimates reserves for losses and loss expenses above 
two key inputs utilized in determining loss and loss expense reserves for the company s two business segments are the initial expected loss ratio and the speed of the loss reporting pattern 
the following tables illustrate the possible percentage effects on current estimates of the reserve for losses and loss expenses due to changes in the initial expected loss ratio and the speed of the loss reporting pattern as of december  the changes in the initial expected loss ratio and the speed of the loss reporting pattern in the tables below were chosen consistent with commonly accepted actuarial practice  due to the company s limited empirical data regarding loss and loss expense reserves variability 
in order to capture the key dynamics of loss development and expected volatility that may arise within the disclosed amounts for the reserve for losses and loss expenses  the lines of business within each business segment are aggregated based on their potential expected length of loss emergence or tail

reporting pattern changes are not applicable to the agricultural business as it is typically settled at an established time each year 
each of the impacts set forth in the tables above is estimated individually  without consideration for any correlation among key assumptions or among lines of business 
therefore  it would be inappropriate to take each of the amounts set forth above and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for the company s loss and loss expense reserves in total 
the company believes the assumed variations in loss and loss expense reserves by individual development tail set forth in the tables above represents a reasonable estimate of the possible loss and loss expense reserve variations by individual development tail that may occur in the future 
it is important to note that the variations set forth in the tables above are not meant to be a best case or worst case series of scenarios  and therefore  it is possible that future variations may be more or less than the amounts set forth above 
ceded reinsurance ceded premiums written were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in ceded premiums written was due to decreased retentions in our us insurance operations  specifically related to the agriculture  property  casualty and professional lines 
the company s us and bermuda insurance operating subsidiaries use proportional and excess reinsurance to protect larger limits on certain business written by this segment 
our agriculture line of business participates in a crop reinsurance program sponsored by the us federal government 
excess reinsurance coverage is often purchased in relation to the property insurance line to protect against catastrophic events 
at december  and  the company had reinsurance recoverables of million and million  respectively  related to its ceded reinsurance agreements 
the company remains obligated for amounts ceded in the event that its reinsurers or retrocessionaires do not meet their obligations  except for amounts ceded related to the agriculture line of business 
accordingly  the company has evaluated the reinsurers and retrocessionaires that are providing reinsurance and retrocessional protection and will continue to monitor the stability of its reinsurers and retrocessionaires 
the company has an allowance of million for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverable balances at december  nil 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangibles that arise from business combinations are accounted for by the company in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets 
the accounting literature requires that identifiable intangible assets are amortized in accordance with their useful lives and goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but should be tested for impairment at least annually 
the company s intangible assets and goodwill are tested at least annually for impairment and more often if a triggering event is deemed to have occurred 
impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates 
the reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level 
the company s reporting units identified include the agriculture line of the insurance segment  the remaining insurance segment lines of business  and the reinsurance segment 
the fair value of the reporting unit is impacted by the performance of the business 
the company uses discounted cash flow analyses to estimate fair value 
there have been no changes in the company s methodologies from the prior year 
if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired  the company must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment  with a corresponding charge to net income 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed its annual impairment testing of goodwill 
the company has two primary sources of goodwill goodwill obtained from a renewal rights transaction completed in with hartre and goodwill obtained from the company s acquisition of armtech in the company determined that the appropriate reporting units for evaluation were the reinsurance segment in relation to hartre goodwill and the agriculture line of business of the insurance segment 
the company used a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of these reporting units 
the fair value determined was in excess of the carrying value including goodwill for both transactions noted 
as a result of the impairment testing  no write downs were deemed necessary at december  and income taxes the company is subject to income taxes on the operations of its subsidiaries and branch offices in the united states  united kingdom  switzerland  singapore and canada 
the company is not required to pay any income or capital gains taxes on its operations in bermuda

these net operating loss carry forwards have no expiration date in the united kingdom and singapore 
in switzerland and the united states the net operating loss carry forwards expire through and  respectively 
there were no income taxes payable in the united kingdom as at december  or 
table of contents the company s loss income before income taxes benefits was distributed as follows for the years ended december   and  respectively september  september  september  us dollars in thousands us domestic non us foreign pre tax loss income gross premiums written and earned by our non us and non us operations generally do not bear a proportionate relationship to the respective pre tax loss income of these operations 
the disproportionate relationship between gross premium written and net loss income between our operations occurs as a result of various factors  including but not limited to the differences in the underlying type of business underwritten  the underwriting profitability attributable to such business  and the applicable investment income generated 
pre tax loss income for our non us operations was favorable compared to us operations for the year ending december  because our us operations were impacted by losses resulting from severe drought conditions within our agriculture line of business which is underwritten by the company s armtech us subsidiary 
pre tax income for our non us operations was higher compared to our non us operations for the years ending december  and primarily as a result of the more volatile catastrophe business underwritten in our non us operations during these periods being relatively free of losses and thus generating higher levels of net underwriting income than our us operations  which underwrite less volatile business and as a result produce lower levels of net underwriting income in benign loss years 
in addition  our non us operations hold a substantial amount of our invested assets and thus a larger portion of the company s investment income is earned in our non us operations as compared to our us operations 
in february  the irs notified the company that it would be conducting an audit of the company s us subsidiaries tax return 
in addition  the canada revenue agency has commenced an examination of income tax returns for and for the canadian branch of one of the company s us subsidiaries 
due to the uncertainty of the outcome of these audits  the company cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible changes to its unrecognized tax benefits at this time 
the company does not expect to receive any adjustments that would result in a material change to its financial position 
none of the company s other subsidiaries or branch operations are under an examination in any of the jurisdictions in which they operate  but they generally remain subject to examination for tax years as of december  and  the company had no uncertain tax positions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities the company is subject to income taxes in certain jurisdictions in which the company operates  however  since the majority of the company s income is currently earned in bermuda  a jurisdiction with no corporate income tax  the tax impact to the company s operations has historically been minimal 
in  the company generated cumulative losses before income taxes in its subsidiaries  which generated a consolidated effective income tax rate 
in  certain subsidiaries of the company in the us generated taxable income largely contributing to the company s income tax expense 
the company s balance sheet at december  contains a net deferred tax asset in the amount of million million deferred tax asset 
the current year net deferred tax asset consists of gross deferred tax assets of million  gross deferred tax liabilities of million and a valuation allowance of million 
of the company s gross deferred tax assets  million million relates to net operating loss carryforwards that are available to offset future taxable income generated by the company s subsidiaries 
the company s net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely in the united kingdom and singapore 
in switzerland and the united states the net operating loss carryforwards expire through and  respectively 
the company has established a valuation allowance of million million against certain operating loss carryforwards at december  the million valuation allowance was established against net operating loss carryforwards in the company s united states subsidiaries  united kingdom subsidiary and non us branches 
the valuation allowance in was established against net operating loss carryforwards in the united kingdom and non us branches 
the increase in the valuation allowance was charged to the company s income tax expense during management believes the net deferred tax assets  less the valuation allowance noted  are more likely than not to be fully realized in corresponding future periods  and the company s net deferred tax asset has been stated appropriately as at december  in the event that management determines in the future that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realized in the near term and prior to their expiration  the company will reassess the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets and record any changes to income tax expense in the period determined 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures at december  our policies to address these risks in were not materially different from the company believes that it is principally exposed to seven types of market risk interest rate risk  liquidity risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk  equity price risk  derivative counterparty credit risk and inflation 
interest rate risk 
the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
the company s fixed investment portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio generally falls  and the converse is generally also true 
the company manages its interest rate risk through an asset liability matching strategy that involves the selection of investments with appropriate characteristics  such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity that are tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our liabilities to create a match of assets and liabilities 
the long term target duration of the assets comprising the fixed maturity portfolio versus liabilities including reserves for losses and loss expenses was approximately years for the majority of our target duration for managed assets was years at december  a significant portion of the investment portfolio matures each quarter  allowing for reinvestment at current market rates 
as of december   assuming parallel shifts in interest rates  the impact of these interest rate shifts in basis points on the company s cash and fixed maturity portfolio of  million at december  would have been as follows september  september  september  september  september  interest rate shift in basis points december  us dollars in millions total market value market value change from base change in unrealized value in addition  we consider the effect of credit spread movements on the market value of our fixed maturities  short term investments and certain of our other investments accounted for using the equity method which invest in fixed maturity securities and the corresponding change in unrealized appreciation 
as credit spreads widen  the market value of our fixed maturity securities falls  and the converse is also true 
the following table summarizes the effect that an immediate  parallel shift in credit spreads in a static interest rate environment would have had on the company s cash and fixed maturity portfolio at december  september  september  september  september  september  credit spread shift in basis points december  us dollars in millions total market value market value change from base change in unrealized value another method used by the company to evaluate portfolio risk is value at risk var 
var is a probabilistic method of measuring the potential loss in portfolio value over a given time period and for a given distribution of historical returns 
portfolio risk  as measured by var  is affected by four primary risk factors asset concentration  asset volatility  asset correlation and systematic risk 
for a one year period over of the time  assuming the risks taken into account in the var model perform per their historical tendencies  the portfolio loss for this year period is expected to be less than or equal to at december  the company s other investments are exposed to interest rate risk 
to the extent that the securities underlying these investments have fixed maturities  fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments 
liquidity risk 
when financial markets experience a reduction in liquidity  our ability to conduct orderly investment transactions may be limited and may result in declines in fair values of the securities in our investment portfolio 
in addition  if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements which could include claims on a major catastrophe event in a period of market illiquidity  we may have difficulty selling our investments in a timely manner and may have to dispose of our investments for less than what may otherwise have been possible under other conditions 

table of contents foreign currency risk 
the company has made a significant investment in the capitalization of endurance uk  which is denominated in british sterling 
in addition  the company enters into reinsurance and insurance contracts for which it is obligated to pay losses in currencies other than us dollars 
the majority of our operating foreign currency assets and liabilities are denominated in euros  british sterling  canadian dollars  japanese yen  new zealand dollars and australian dollars 
the company may  from time to time  experience losses from fluctuations in the values of these and other non us currencies  which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
the company will attempt to manage its foreign currency risk by seeking to match its liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in such currencies 
the company purchases assets which are matched in currency to its case reserves for liabilities incurred in major currencies including us dollars  euros  british sterling  canadian dollars  japanese yen  new zealand dollars and australian dollars at or shortly after the time such reserves are established 
the investment portfolio will at times have non us dollar exposure hedged back to us dollars 
as part of its asset liability matching strategy  the company may also consider the use of hedges when it becomes aware of probable significant losses that will be paid in non us dollar currencies 
for liabilities incurred in currencies other than those listed above  us dollars are converted to the currency of the loss at the time of claims payment 
as a result  the company may  from time to time  experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies 
assets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currency is not the us dollar are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses of such foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates during the period 
the effect of the translation adjustments for foreign operations is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are revalued at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date with the resulting foreign exchange gains and losses included in earnings 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the transaction date 
for the year ended december   of the company s gross premiums were written in currencies other than the us dollar 
the portions of our cash and cash equivalents  investments and reserves for loss and loss expenses denominated in non us currencies at december  were approximately  and  respectively 
as of december   the company s principal foreign currency exposures are denominated in japanese yen and british sterling 
the company measures and manages its exposure in these currencies  among others  by monitoring its estimated gross and net asset positions 
in order to estimate such exposures  the company considers currency specific investments  cash and cash equivalents  premiums receivable  reserve for losses and loss expenses  and unearned premiums 
the total estimated gross asset and net liability balances denominated in japanese yen were million and million  respectively 
the total estimated gross and net asset balances denominated in british sterling were million and million  respectively 
assuming all other variables are held constant and disregarding any tax effects  a change in the us dollar relative to these currencies could result in a million increase or decrease in the net assets held by the company at december  credit risk 
the company has exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed maturity investments  short term investments  equity securities  alternative funds and specialty funds 
the company s risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories and any one issuer 
the company attempts to limit its credit exposure by investing the fixed maturity portfolio primarily in investments rated a a or higher 
in addition  the company has limited its exposure to any single corporate issuer to of its fixed maturity portfolio 

table of contents the following table summarizes the fair value composition of the company s fixed maturity investments and short term investments by investment ratings assigned by s p  moody s or other rating agencies and by contractual maturity at december  in some cases  where bonds are unrated  the rating of the issuer has been applied 
expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties

in addition  the company has exposure to credit risk as it relates to losses recoverable on paid and unpaid losses where the company has purchased reinsurance and retrocessional coverages 
the company relies on reinsurance within its insurance businesses in order to manage risk accumulations 
the company continues not to rely heavily on retrocessional reinsurance  but strategically purchases coverage across the entire portfolio to reduce exposure to the risk of a severe catastrophe event or occurrence of multiple significant catastrophe events 
when reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance is purchased  the company requires its reinsurers to have strong financial strength ratings 
the company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors its concentration of credit risk on an ongoing basis 
the balance of losses recoverable at december  was million 
at december   the company had an allowance of for estimated uncollectible losses recoverable 
the balance of losses recoverable at december  was distributed as follows based on the ratings of the reinsurers september  rating december  us dollars in thousands us government sponsored program a and above a a and below not rated total equity price risk 
the company invests a portion of its investment portfolio in marketable equity securities fair market value of million at december  these equity investments are exposed to equity price risk  defined as the potential that the company incurs an economic loss due to a decline of common stock prices 
beta analysis is used to measure the sensitivity of our equity portfolio to changes in the value of the s p index an index representative of the broad equity market 
our current equity portfolio excluding perpetual preferred equities has a beta of in comparison to the s p index 

table of contents in addition to beta analysis  a sensitivity analysis can be used to assess equity price risk under varying conditions 
the base sensitivity analysis below uses market scenarios of the s p index declining both percent and percent to determine the impact of such a decline on the value of the company s equity securities 
these scenarios would result in approximate decreases in the fair market value of the company s equity securities of million and million  respectively 
as we designate all equities as available for sale  these fair value declines would impact the company s consolidated balance sheet 
xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx december  decrease change decrease change increase change increase change us dollars in thousands equities total invested assets shareholders equity includes total investments and cash and cash equivalents net of investments pending settlement 
the changes described above do not take into account any potential mitigating impact from the company s fixed income or alternative investment portfolios or the impact of taxes 
derivative counterparty credit risk 
in addition to the company s exposure to credit risk as a holder of fixed maturity investments  short term investments  equity securities  alternative funds and specialty funds  and the company s exposure to credit risk as relates to reinsurance and retrocessional recoverables  the company also has credit risk exposure as a party to derivative financial instruments 
in order to mitigate the risks associated with derivatives  the company diversifies its counterparty credit risk  ensures that the counterparties to its derivative contracts are credit worthy and monitors on a regular basis its exposure by counterparty in order to mitigate the counterparty credit risks associated with its derivative contracts 
in addition  counterparty risk is mitigated by the periodic receipt of payment of margin 
at december   the company s absolute notional value of derivative contracts was million  while the net liability position of those derivative contracts was million 
derivative interest rate risk 
the company uses interest rate futures and swaps within our portfolio of fixed maturity investments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk  which can include increasing or decreasing our exposure to this risk 
we account for these derivatives at fair value and record them in our consolidated balance sheet as other assets or other liabilities depending on the rights or obligations 
the fair value of these derivatives as recognized in other assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december   was million 
the aggregate hypothetical loss generated from an immediate upward parallel shift in the treasury yield curve of basis points would cause a decrease in market value of our net position in the eurodollar futures contracts and interest rate swaps of approximately million at december  credit spreads are assumed to remain constant in these hypothetical examples 
effects of inflation 
the effects of inflation could cause the cost of claims to rise in the future 
the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy 
the company s estimates for losses and loss expenses include assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  however to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above the reserves established  the company will be required to increase the reserve for losses and loss expenses 
in addition  inflation could lead to higher interest rates causing the current unrealized gain position on the company s fixed maturity portfolio to decrease 
the current short duration of the company s fixed maturity portfolio has the potential to help reduce the negative effects of higher interest rates on the company s fixed maturity portfolio 
the company may also choose to hold its fixed maturity portfolio to maturity which would result in the unrealized gains largely amortizing through net investment income
